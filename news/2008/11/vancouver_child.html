<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Children of Chinese ancestry who have lived only in Metro Vancouver are more likely to have asthma than those living in Hong Kong or mainland China, says a study published today in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.</p>
<p>The study of more than 10,000 13- and 14-year-olds found that asthma and wheezing were most prevalent among Chinese adolescents who have lived their whole lives in Vancouver, second-highest among native Chinese adolescents living in Hong Kong, and lowest among native Chinese adolescents living in the mainland China cities Beijing and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Among Chinese adolescents of both sexes in Metro Vancouver, the prevalence of wheezing &mdash; a major symptom of asthma &mdash; was 14.5 per cent for immigrants who had lived in Canada fewer than seven years, 18.8 per cent for those with who lived here seven or more years and 20.9 per cent for those who had lived their whole lives in Canada.</p>
<p>The prevalence of a confirmed asthma diagnosis was 7.7 per cent for immigrants with fewer than seven years in Canada, 11.2 per cent for those with seven or more years in Canada and 15.9 per cent for those born in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;These findings suggest that environmental factors and duration of exposure influence asthma prevalence,&#8221; the study states, without pinpointing what those factors are.</p>
<p>In earlier research, factors significantly associated with wheezing included living in a house where cooking is done with gas, the use of foam pillows, and living in damp housing. Protective factors against wheezing included the use of cotton quilts and fruit and vegetable consumption.</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander Ferguson, a now-retired Vancouver co-author of the study could not be reached. Study leader Dr. Hong-Yu (Wendy) Wang, a respirologist from China doing post-doctoral fellowship training in Hamilton, said the study appears to reinforce the &#8220;westernization&#8221; effect on asthma. Improved sanitation and hygiene, less exposure to rural environments, fewer infections in infancy and increased use of antibiotic and vaccination are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma.</p>
<p>Other research has pointed to the &#8220;hygiene hypothesis&#8221; to explain higher asthma rates. In that theory, exposure to infections and contact with older siblings are believed to reduce the risk of allergic diseases, of which asthma is one type.</p>
<p>Wang and her team of researchers from China, Hong Kong and Canada worked with questionnaires filled out by children and/or their parents from 2001 to 2003. There were 7,794 adolescents from China in the study and 2,235 from Vancouver.</p>
<p>The study found that asthma rates among Metro Vancouver-born Chinese children were higher than among children in mainland China, even though a greater proportion of children in China were exposed to parents smoking at home and to truck fumes.</p>
<p>Wang said she still can&rsquo;t pinpoint the reason Chinese children who have lived their whole lives in Vancouver had the highest prevalence of asthma and wheezing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t know exactly what it is about the environment there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It may be that there are children who are genetically predisposed and then, when they live in a certain environment, they have an immune system response that causes the asthma. Maybe it is that Vancouver is a wet-climate coastal city, but we need to do more research on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang discounted the notion that it may be that Vancouver doctors simply diagnose asthma more than doctors in China.</p>
<p>She said that as a doctor from China, she can attest that Beijing and Guangzhou are very similar to Vancouver when it comes to access to medical care and provision of medical services.</p>
<p>The study, which can be read on the Internet at https://www.cmaj.ca, was financed by Health Canada and a grant to Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>A study in the same issue of CMAJ, on Canadian adults diagnosed with asthma, suggests doctors may be overdiagnosing the condition. It found that 30 per cent of adults who enrolled in the study after being diagnosed with asthma actually did not have it, based on more detailed lung and bronchial assessments.</p>
<p>Few studies on the prevalence of asthma among immigrants have been done in Canada, the researchers say, and this is the first to collect such data on Chinese people living in Canada. It is part of the ongoing International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood which began in 1991.</p>

		<p>I have a theory.  I think the reason there is so much asthma in Canada and the U.S. are that parents there are usually obsessed with making their newborn babies atmosphere as pure and germ-free as possible.  A newborn baby has his or her mother&rsquo;s immune system for their first six months of life, that giving the baby a chance to build up their own immune system.  If they&rsquo;re raised in a bubble, essentially, they&rsquo;ll have no immune system when they turn six months, meaning they&rsquo;ll be more prone to allergies.  Allergies are a prime trigger for asthma.</p>
<p>My guess is that the Chinese in Vancouver are more likely to &#8220;bubble&#8221; their babies after birth than the Chinese in Hong Kong.</p>

		<p>Well, this article doesn&rsquo;t really say anything outrageous. What is remarkable, is that Vancouver is now, primarily, an Asian city. The majority of the city is home to Asians, mainly Chinese, but with smatterings from South Asia, India and the like. In fact, except for the fringe districts of Kitsilano, the downtown West-End and small enclaves around Commercial Street, the vast, vast majority of the city if Chinese. If you doubt my word, pick any school outside of those two first mentioned areas, and watch the kids coming out at three p.m.  All you will see is a sea of black hair and Asian faces. Many schools are better than 95% Asian, and a couple are entirely Chinese, period.</p>
<p>The suburbs of the region have flourished as Canadians have evacuated from the primary city core in an effort to maintain some sort of cultural hegemony with their neighbours. Vancouver is known as one of the most expensive cities to live in, simply based on the laws of supply and demand, as immigrants flood into the city and seek limited housing. And, being from poorer Asian societies, their idea of communal living allows many to live together and actually afford a house in the $750,000+ range, that a double income husband and wife could not even sniff at. Such is the condition of Vancouver now. I shall not mention the (asian) gang warfare, (asian) home-invasion robberies, (asian)honour killing, (asian) dog cooking and animal cruelty, (asian) SARS epidemic, (asian) littering, (asian) health violations etc, etc, etc&hellip; you can google them for yourselves. </p>

		<p>This one is a no brainer.  Canadians vaccinate their newborns for everything under the sun long before the infants&rsquo; immune systems are fully developed and can handle it.  The Chinese vaccinate, but not nearly to the degree that Westerners do.  Vaccinations compromise children&rsquo;s immune systems, and asthma is an auto-immune disorder.</p>
<p>Asthma rates in the U.S. have also soared, directly in proportion to the high levels of vaccinations.  The same is true for autism.  This is not a socio-economic issue, per se.</p>

<p>The vast majority of Canada is still White at 84% of the population. The minority are mostly in large cities - and this is what makes WN in Canada fearful. However, if you go into the prairie provinces, northern Ontario or the Maritime provinces you will notice that many of these areas are completely White. I suggest you leave Vancouver, because it sounds like you can&rsquo;t stand it at all.</p>
<p>A few other things. The Chinese don&rsquo;t eat domestic animals in Canada. In fact, it&rsquo;s only a very small minority of people in China who consume that. Horse meat is eaten in many European countries, some might think that&rsquo;s disgusting. </p>
<p>Asian honour killings are local to some people (mostly in the Middle East) and doesn&rsquo;t apply to the rest of Asia. You&rsquo;ve just lumped everyone from the continent together and exaggerated the problem to be greater than it actually is. Use the descriptor &#8216;Asian&rsquo; carefully and be more specific or else you will come off as sounding ignorant.</p>

		<p>John is right on, Vancouver is a totally foreign city, might as well separate from Canada and join China.</p>
<p>This we can thank our wonderful political leaders for.</p>
<p>I no longer travel there, it is too sad to see what has happened to a wonderful white city.</p>

		<p>One of the Chinese I worked with in Australia told me that Chinese living Down Under also have quite high athsma rates.</p>
<p>My own experiences there were strange, healthwise.  My usual hayfever-type allergies didn&rsquo;t bother me at all in Australia, but I was sick more in 14 months there than in any 14 years of my life in the US.  My system appears not to have mistaken the native pollen for germs (which is all an allergy is), but also couldn&rsquo;t cope with the native germs.</p>

<p>Except for Newfoundland, the areas you mention were never completely white, because there have always been native Indians there. But except for native Indians, all of Canada was once completely white, including Vancouver. It is nowhere written in stone that Asians in BRITISH Columbia will not someday return to Asia under some as yet unforeseen circumstance. This is what the native Indians would have done to us had they the strength: forced us out. Our weakness as whites is entirely psychological and could therefore turn on a dime, so you should be nervous about advising John to simply leave Vancouver. It may be that, in his own way, he is someone who is prepared to make a stand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese don&rsquo;t eat domestic animals in Canada&hellip; Asian honour killings are local to some people (mostly in the Middle East) and doesn&rsquo;t apply to the rest of Asia. You&rsquo;ve just lumped everyone from the continent together and exaggerated the problem to be greater than it actually is. Use the descriptor &lsquo;Asian&rsquo; carefully and be more specific or else you will come off as sounding ignorant.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is you who are ignorant. We white nationalists know very well that there are significant differences among Asians; between Japanese, Chinese, Indians, Arabs and so forth. But there is one thing they have in common that is far more important to us. They are all foreigners in our lands.</p>
<p>The Chinese penchant for &#8216;small meats,&rsquo; slaughtered under dubious hygiene, has been noted by white visitors since Marco Polo, and continues to this day; witness the pre-Olympic government ban on the serving of dog in Peking-area restaurants. It reflects what H. G. Wells referred to as the most salient fact of East Asian history: a very tight battle between population and available protein. This population pressure, much older and greater than Europe&rsquo;s, in turn is reflected in a characteristic that almost all Asians share, if for varied reasons: a much higher tolerance for despotism than we whites possess.</p>
<p>Among South Asians and Middle Easterners, this despotism often plays out at the extended family level as unquestioned obedience to a local alpha-male, as honour-killings, for example. Among East Asians, it plays out in their notorious herd behaviour, as unquestioned obedience to despotic government. </p>
<p>But the point is this: Chinaman, Hindu, Pakistani or Arab: your ways are not our ways. And our tolerance for your ways in our own lands will not necessarily last forever.</p>

		<p>American and Canadian asian kids get more shots than Chinese kids - which devastates the immune system.</p>
<p>Autism, ADD, allergies, asthma, and learning disabilities are all linked to getting vaccination shots.</p>
<p>A few years ago I took my child to his T-ball practice. There were 3 mothers there with their 3 sons. I was the 4th parent to show up. All 3 mothers were discussing the allergy medicine for their boys. All three boys were on allergy drugs!</p>
<p>In my opinion, American children - mostly white - have been given these shots by a government that is fully aware of what they are doing to our kids. After all, this is the same government that has convinced mothers to murder their own babies since 1973 - over 50 million babies, one of the greatest genocides in human history. Just think of what America would be like today with 50 million people age 35 and younger - mostly white. </p>
<p>I have 4 boys ages 1 - 11. None of them have had any shots. We have probably filled less than 10 prescriptions for antibiotics in the last 11 years, for all of our boys. They are all top athletes and top students, and none of them have allergy problems or anything like that.</p>
<p>Do a google search on &#8216;DPT vaccine mercury&rsquo;. You will find official government reports as well as news reports discussing how many times mercury was found to have contaminated various vaccines at highly toxic levels. The mercury was only discovered after kids were poisoned with it. And it has happened over and over and over. This stuff is being shot directly into the bloodstream of our babies. Mercury. THINK.</p>

<p>Slightly off topic, but I must answer to this suggestion. You must realize those are &#8220;fighting words&#8221; when suggesting that white Canadian-born citizens make haste and depart a sovereign Canadian city of <i>their</i> rightful choice? </p>
<p>I live in the province of Ontario and it&rsquo;s been ten years since my last visit to Vancouver, but I distinctly remember walking through many suburban Richmond shopping areas (Immigrant Chinese occupied territory) and very often receiving the <i>cold shoulder</i>, as if I didn&rsquo;t belong in &#8220;their&#8221; area. Strangely enough, I received that same type of attitude in New Zealand, not from New Zealanders, but also from recently ensconced Chinese immigrants who had swamped suburban Mt. Albert, Auckland, a city I had just arrived from! </p>
<p>The height of supreme arrogance arises when foreign invaders occupy enough of the &#8220;conquered territory&#8221; en masse to where they falsely assume it as their own. Through blood, sweat and tears, it&rsquo;s the original settlers&rsquo; descendants who actually built Vancouver&rsquo;s modern infrastructure and we don&rsquo;t take kindly to unwarranted suggestions that also work in reverse, if you get my meaning. (Yes, we&rsquo;re aware, <i>ad nauseam</i>, of the Chinese who toiled along with thousands of others in building the railroad out in the hinterland.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, comparing China&rsquo;s 1 Billion and 350 million people to a mere 33 million Canadians in our country, we would dearly like to hold onto <b>all</b> of our own territory without having to answer to any more &#8220;suggestions&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>This article does serve as a good focal point for debate about Asianization, but other than that, I&rsquo;m not really sure why AR picked it up. It&rsquo;s especially unclear why the AR subtitle &#8220;Environmental explanation not yet forthcoming,&#8221; derived from part of the article, was chosen; in a race-realist context, it implies that a racial explanation is being ignored.</p>
<p>In fact, the interest in the article is almost entirely in the &lsquo;hygiene hypothesis,&rsquo; which is well-outlined in the article, is an environmental explanation, has been an area of intense interest in asthma and allergy for several years now, and is not at all &#8216;your&rsquo; theory, Question Diversity. </p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m as big a race realist as anyone, but someone at AR is on the wrong track with this one. The gist of the article is that an environmental factor is almost certainly the explanation, since the whole idea of the study was to control for race by studying THE SAME RACE (Chinese) in all three situations. The interesting question is whether the hygiene hypothesis is the environmental explanation, or whether it&rsquo;s something else, something like the anti-vaccine notions of conspiracy theorists who freeload on herd immunity (google it). Hmm, freeloading on other men of the West &hellip; not very white!</p>

		<p>John of Vancouver defends himself against the scurrilous hordes of multi-culti worshipers and de-bones their inaccuracies. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Economist ranked the best cities in the world to live.Vancouver was ranked first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, it has been voted the number one place in the world to live not just once, but a number of times by a variety of magazines. It is a marvellous place, but that is so despite the Chinese and East Indians and other assorted Asians, not because of them. I made the specific point that Canadians in Vancouver are largely ensconced in two districts, comprising perhaps 20% of the city land mass, named Kitsilano and the West End, which is the downtown peninsula. Of course there are Canadians in other parts of the city, but they are peppered throughout, and are the obvious visible minority. Look up www.tourismvancouver.com and cast your beady eyes upon the slide show at the top left hand corner. Not a single picture shows the ethnic pleasures of the other 80% of the City. Slide #1 is of three white guys jamming on a field near the harbour (in the West End).  #2 shows a cruise ship sliding under the Lions Gate Bridge leading from Stanley Park (in the West End).  #3 the downtown peninsula (aka, the West End).  #4 Vancouver library (in the West End).  #5 The West End viewed from the mountains of West Vancouver City (not to be confused with Vancouver, it is an entirely different city with very, very little in the way of ornamentals).  #6 the Inukshuk at English Bay (in the West End).</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting how an organization like Tourism Vancouver instinctively gravitates to that part of Vancouver which is still predominantly Canadian? Those vile racists! For a real view of what Vancouver looks like, have a gander here https://britannia.vsb.bc.ca/student_council/student_council.htm  and here  <a href="https://jo-online.vsb.bc.ca/dryGrad2008/dryGrad4.cfm" rel="nofollow">https://jo-online.vsb.bc.ca/dryGrad2008/dryGrad4.cfm</a> and here https://ehssstudentcouncil.webs.com/whoweare.htm . Three schools representing the south east, north east, and western corners of Vancouver, which, shaped like a triangle, finishes at a western point named, coincidentally, Pt. Grey. Check out the Vancouver School Board web-site and look up the other schools for yourself – you know, just to prove me wrong. </p>
<p>Now, as for eating cats and dogs, well, the World Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has videos they shot secretly that would blow your mind. They have also traced the eating of small domestic animals into the Western world by Chinese and Koreans, specifically mentioning Vancouver. If your stomach can handle it, have a gander here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_x_SO5Q0dk" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_x_SO5Q0dk</a>  and here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=related&amp;v=93TkKnctWGc." rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=related&v;=93TkKnctWGc.</a> This puts to lie very nicely the stupid comparison earlier between eating dogs and horses. Dogs and cats actually gravitate toward human contact, while horses and cows have had to bee forceably domesticated. You will notice in the second video how even when the animals are horribly and inhumanely treated, when the blond woman puts her hand near the cage, they rush to her for a loving stroke, even as the Chinese go back and forth beating and skinning them before their very eyes. <br>

About honour killings, Vancouver and particularly the suburb of Surrey, is absolutely notorious across Canada for its many, many reported honour killings. You can look that up here too, https://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/917/honorkilling.html.  Each and every one is by Moslems and Sikhs, who, if my geography is correct, are Asians.</p>
<p>As for Asian gang violence, well, up until the 80&rsquo;s, such activities were the myth of T.V. here in Vancouver. Purportedly the mafia and Hell&rsquo;s Angels were around,but they didn&rsquo;t shoot up restaurants and pedestrians hither and yon. Earlier this year the Provincial Attorney General started up a task force to look into East Indian gang violence  which, to quote from a local newspaper, &#8220;In British Columbia, most of the gang related violence is happening in the South Asian community, according to the Integrated Gang Task Force (IGTF). The task force reports, The majority of crimes are opportunistic – extortion, kidnapping, drug &lsquo;rips,&rsquo; drug smuggling, homicides and violent acts. And it suggests that the bad boys with the guns still adhere to traditional Sikh values of &ldquo;image, status, reputation and respect.&rdquo; Drive-by shootings and other culturally enriching phenomenon, for which the Chinese, Vietnamese and Indians are absolutely infamous, have risen sharply over the last decade. You can read about that here,  https://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/11/06/bc-policetaskforce.html. </p>
<p>Despite what my detractors may say, the facts speak for themselves, as do the home nations of these people. As Tony Blair once said ( o paraphrase), you can get the gist of a nation pretty quickly by measuring the number of people who want to leave as opposed to the number who want enter. I guess that makes Tony a raving, ignorant racist too, yes?<br>

		<p>I recently visited Vancouver(about a month ago) and the poster above is correct; the entire city is Oriental. It was only five or six years ago when this was a white majority city. Pardon my language, but what the hell is happening to the west coast cities? Every place I visit is suddenly swamped with Asians/Latinos-every metropolitan California area(as expected) but also increasingly the Mountain cities like Denver, Salt Lake and Boulder.</p>
<p>Dont get me wrong, I really do admire the &#8220;liberal&#8221; virtue of judging a person as an individual and I have a few close Asian/minority friends, but its almost gotten to the point where these first and even second generation immigrants can form a nation within a nation. There are no more white/western people to &#8220;assimilate&#8221; into. Its just too much too fast and it does make people uneasy.</p>

<p>Excuse me, but you&rsquo;re a little bit off. The Chinese started coming in the 1980s and were over half the city by the mid &rsquo;90s so Vancouver hasn&rsquo;t been a &#8216;white majority city&rsquo; for quite sometime now. I used to go and visit my grandparents there every six weeks or so while they were alive. By the time I was around ten, which would have been 1990 or so, it was rare that the only white Canadians you saw in many areas of town were retired people in the sixties and older. Everyone else was a non-white immigrant mainly Chinese or Indian. </p>

		<p>Here are some official population figures that include visible-minorities for the City of Vancouver and the Metro Vancouver area. In the year 2001, the City dropped <i>below majority White</i> for the first time when Aboriginals are included with visible-minorities.</p>

<p>That same percentage also applies to Metro Toronto, a once great Canadian city that <i>was</i> about 98% White&hellip;just four decades ago! </p>
<p>Both Greater Vancouver and Toronto are destined to be <b>permanently</b> minority-white as a result of mass immigration from 3rd world countries. </p>

		<p>You say Vancouver is a great place despite the people who demographically dominate the place?  So the majority of citizens degrade the quality of the city but it still manages to be the best?  Does that mean the core of the city is 5-6 times superior than any other comparable city core?  Or does logic fall apart when trying to sustain these two claims?  I say the latter.  It&rsquo;s apparent from the consistent rankings that the overall infusion of the immigrants is fresh quality.  </p>

		<p>The preservative in the DPT vaccine is a mercury-containing compound called thimersol.  This is the active componant of the &#8220;merthiolate&#8221; topical antiseptic.</p>
<p>A bit of common sense on the part of drug manufacturers would be to end the thimersol controversary by switching preservatives.  Ethyl alcohol would work just fine, and its effects on the human system are both very temporary and well-understood.</p>
