<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7704835.stm">Caterer Sues Police Over Sausages</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Muslim catering manager has accused the Metropolitan Police of religious discrimination as he was told he may have to handle sausages and bacon. </p>
<p>Hasanali Khoja was told he would be expected to handle pork products at his new job at the Empress State Building in Earls Court, west London. </p>
<p>His lawyer said Mr Khoja was excused from pork meat in his previous job at Hendon Police College in north London. </p>
<p>An informal agreement was reached with the force but he wants it formalised. </p>
<p>An employment tribunal in Watford will consider his claim in May 2009. </p>
<p>A Metropolitan Police (Met) spokesman said it was defending a claim of religious discrimination brought against it at an employment tribunal. </p>
<p>Islam forbids the consumption of pork meat or products containing pork. </p>
<p>Mr Khoja, a senior catering manager, has been working with the Met since 2005 and filed the claim in the tribunal last year. </p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Obviously nobody in my situation would be happy. Pork handling is the issue.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Religious beliefs </p>
<p>His lawyer Khalid Sofi said: &ldquo;The claim is about his religious beliefs. They failed to accommodate him as they had a duty to do under the law. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He would have had to do certain things and bacon would have been involved.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr Sofi said the Met reached an informal agreement with his client in June to excuse him from handling pork products after he took special leave from his job. </p>
<p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said: &ldquo;A catering manager is bringing employment tribunal proceedings against the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) alleging religious belief discrimination. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The MPS is defending the claim.&rdquo; <br/>

		<p>Wonder if he has ever heard of that old custom of saving bacon and sausage grease and using it for frying, greasing baking pans and seasoning food.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;d like to come to dinner at my house.  Here&rsquo;s the menu:<br/>
Wilted spinach salad with hot bacon grease and vinegar dressing and pieces of bacon, cornbread cooked in a hot iron skillet oiled with bacon grease instead of crisco, baked ham of course, and collard greens cooked with hamhocks.  Yum yum yum</p>
<p>No wonder muslim countries are so backward. With all the time spent praying, washing and preparing for prayer, chaperoning their women to the market and back and forth to school, rioting, spying on female relatives and neighbors for transgressions against chastity and modesty, reporting those transgressions to their male guardians and all the other muslim obligations the men have no time to do anything else.</p>
<p>There was a news report about Afghanistan&rsquo;s only female police officer.  She was given special dispensation by a Sharia court to touch men in the course of her duties.  She is also chaperoned by her brother all day.  He guards her modesty and behavior from the time she leaves the house, accompanies her all day amd makes sure she behaves as a proper modest muslim maiden till they get home at night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of job I&rsquo;d like, chaperoning a female worker.</p>
<p>The article did say if he was paid or not.</p>

		<p>They have endless demands!  Will these petty complaints never cease?</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Islam forbids the consumption of pork meat or products containing pork.&#8221; </b></p>
<p>I do not see where it says they cannot be touched.  Nobody is asking him to eat them.</p>

		<p>How is this &#8220;religious discrimination&#8221;? He knows that working as a caterer or in many food industries means that he will have to handle pork. If he can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t do the job, then HE needs to find one he is willing to do, perhaps catering for a muslim-run restaurant or better yet, going back to his country of origin!!!! Frankly, this guy sounds like a con artist out for a buck and using white people&rsquo;s system of non-discrimination to his advantage.<br/>

		<p>What a sensitive and devout man. <br/>
This same barbarian would cut his daughter&rsquo;s throat for wearing a short dress. No discrimination in that case.<br/>

		<p>The article didn&rsquo;t say if he is a black convert or a recent black immigrant. Either way he clearly knows about the &#8220;Ghetto Lottery&#8221; and is looking to retire.</p>

		<p>It is an undeniable, undisputed fact (almost as strong as the sun rising in the morning), that an Englishman loves a good old fashioned &#8216;fry-up&rsquo; in the morning.It even has a cherished nickname of its own - &#8216;the full Monty&rsquo; - the &#8216;fry-up&rsquo; generally consists of a fried egg or two, a helping of baked beans, a few &#8216;chipolata&rsquo; sausages and most crucially of all, several rahers of streaky bacon, generally fried down to a crisp.This is accompanied by a cup of tea and perhaps a few slices of bread and butter.<br/>
Yes, this high cholesterol, heart attack inducing dish has been the traditional motor that got the English working man set up for the morning for a day&rsquo;s hard graft on the building site,the dust-round,the factory even in the policeman&rsquo;s beat in the cold, foggy, damp<br/>
 British climate.It&rsquo;s a national institution -dearly loved and looked forward too by millions of British workers every morning of every day.<br/>
 For someone to accept employment cooking for Englishmen, and refusing to handle bacon, simply beggars belief.</p>

		<p>This guy should not be in Britain in the first place. What is he doing in the island of Englishmen, Scotsmen, Welshmen and the Cornish? Kick him and all of his kind out. There is no other solution. </p>

		<p>You would think that, at this bloke&rsquo;s original interview, someone would have pointed out to him that the average British copper&rsquo;s canteen breakfast consists of bacon, pork sausages, black pudding (made with pig blood), a couple of fried eggs, grilled tomatoes and fried bread, washed down with a mug of super-strength tea, and asked him if, as he was a muslim, he was OK about cooking this.<br/>
You would, however, be wrong.  It is a measure of the current level of dhimmification of British public life that he was almost certainly NOT asked this, one would suppose vital, question.</p>

No one should ever have compromised with this Mohammedan in the first place. Does anybody remember the story of the camel in the tent? This is the parable these desert bunnies live by. Always demand more, and more, and then more.</p>
