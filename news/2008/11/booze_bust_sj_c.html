			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric C. Rich, KNTV (San Francisco), November 19, 200</i></p>

<p>Latino groups in San Jose put the police chief on the defensive Tuesday as they claimed they are being unfairly arrested for being drunk in public.</p>
<p>Community groups spent hour speaking out against the city&rsquo;s high number of arrests for being drunk in public.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year San Jose arrested 4,661 people for public drunkenness, far more than any other city in California. Critics say police officers are enforcing the law too aggressively and clogging up the court system.</p>
<p>57 percent of those arrested were Latino, which also led to allegations of racial profiling. Latinos make up only 32 percent of the city&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>San Jose Police Chief Rob Davis has denied racial profiling and considers the arrests a serious way to deal with a legitimate threat to public safety.</p>
<p>The city is currently facing a federal lawsuit, filed last month by three men who said they were wrongly charged with public drunkenness.</p>
<p>A main concern for the community groups and activists opposed to the arrest policy is that officers are allowed to use their own discretion in making an arrest for being drunk in public. A blood or breath test does not need to be administered, something Davis believes could be changed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Councilman Sam Liccardo represents the city&rsquo;s downtown district, where 36% of the arrests have occured. Liccardo says he supports opening the sobering centers and requiring some proof of intoxication for arrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&rsquo;t a clear definition,&#8221; Councilwoman Nora Campos said. &#8220;The law is very vague and its important for us to have a law that&rsquo;s defined so it protects the police officer making the arrest, as well as the citizen.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Maybe they should start a busing program.  They can bring in white alcoholics so there is no racial inequality.</p>

<p>Hey latinos or whatever you call yourselves these days, there is a simple solution&hellip;go back from whence you came. </p>
<p>No worries about pubic intoxication in latino countries. Problem solved.</p>

		<p>Has anyone watched &#8220;Latinos&#8221; in the supermarkets? They roll out basket after basket filled with cases of cervaza. First the beer goes down, then the car keys come out. It&rsquo;s a game people, one of the many wonderful cultural traditions they bring with them as they invade and colonize this once proud nation.</p>

		<p>  Racism and racial profiling are the war cries of every non-white in this nation, legal and illegal. It is the one allegation for which whites have no defense. A charge of racism or profiling is a shut case against us. Guilty as charged, regardless. How do you enforce the law when you are broad-sided by these charges? The charges of racism and profiling are smoke and mirrors to distract. If a minority is caught breaking the law, it is automatically due to racism AND racial profiling. Will we have to have different standards of law according to the racial make-up of the perp? Can you imagine what this country will be like in 2042? Something has to change really soon. Our nation of immigrants is quickly becoming a third world sewer. And not a bit of shame is felt by those whom started this malignancy growing into a full-blown cancer. America and the rest of the &#8220;western world&#8221; are the new third world. China is the new super power. Russia may or may not figure in there somewhere. I know we won&rsquo;t. </p>

<p>This is as absurd as it gets, folks.</p>
<p>There is a growing population of morons in America. They accept the quoted above fallacy (that the problem is not the increase of drunkards but the eforcement of the law) as a valid argument.</p>
<p>And there is another growing population of the gullible in America that keeps electing these morons to public offices.</p>
<p>A day will come when drunken Mexicans will rule on the streets of SJ (and other cities with large &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; population) and police will do nothing out of fear of being called &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>One more reason to deport every single deportable alien back to Mexico.</p>

		<p>I was in line at North Carolina grocery store last year. In front of me was a Hispanic couple with six kids, looking in age from about 6 months to six years, chattering away in Spanish. The woman paid for the food and other items with stamps. Her husband then put two cases of beer on the conveyor and paid for them with a Nations Bank credit card. We are getting played like a Steinway Piano.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the answer for them would be to stop getting drunk in public, if they had any sense of personal responsibility at all.</p>
<p>Naah - too complicated.  Easier to just complain that the law is &#8220;unfair&#8221;.</p>
<p>I got fairly inebriated last night on lemon-honey mead, and did it at home.  No police pulled me over on the stairs when I went up to go to sleep.  Funny, that.</p>

		<p>June, there are millions upon millions of Americans who do not care about what you are saying, and furthermore they will report you one day for simple  &mdash;  telling the truth. I have to wonder how anyone can really feel sorry for people who are this stupid and duplicitous, when their nation is finally taken over and they become second or third class ctizens. Where are they planning to go?</p>
