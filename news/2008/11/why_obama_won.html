				Why Obama Won
			</h1>
			<p class="byline">
				<i>Ben Smith and Jonathan Martin, Politico, Nov. 5, 2008</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Barack Obama&rsquo;s sweeping victory as president of the United States sends him to the White House to face what may be the worst national financial crisis since the time of Franklin Roosevelt&rsquo;s election in 1932.
			</p>
			<p>
				Obama won on his own terms, strategically and symbolically. He rolled up a series of contested states, from Colorado to Virginia, long out of Democratic reach. And his victory reflected the accuracy of his vision of a reshaped country. Racism, much discussed, turned out to be a footnote, and African-American turnout was not unusually high. Instead, Obama drew his strength from an array of racially mixed, growing areas around cities like Orlando, Washington, Indianapolis, and Columbus on his way to at least 334 electoral votes.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				In his clear-cut victory, Obama became the first Democrat to win a majority of American votes since Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s 1976 election. He won states just months ago thought to be impregnable to his party, places that just four years ago went for President Bush by double-digits: Virginia, Indiana, and North Carolina among them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Indeed, Obama won in all regions of the country but the Deep South, piling up big wins in the perennial Democratic bulwarks on both coasts and making deep inroads into New South states, the industrial and agricultural heartland and the fast-growing Rocky Mountain West.
			</p>
			<p>
				But perhaps most spectacularly, he found victory with a multiracial coalition that has the makings of a formidable political base of power.
			</p>
			<p>
				If his was the first 21st century campaign, his victory was powered by a new face of America: comprised of all ethnicities, hailing mostly from cities and suburbs, largely under 40 years old, and among all income classes.
			</p>
			<p>
				As they emphatically proved by obliterating the presidential color line, many of these voters are not guided by traditional cultural attachment to race, religion or region.
			</p>
			<p>
				What makes his victory so resounding, and so daunting for Republicans, was that he combined support from African-Americans, Jews, and young whites with other key groups. He also reversed President Bush&rsquo;s advances with Hispanic voters.
			</p>
			<p>
				Further, and even more worrisome for the GOP, Obama was dominant among self-described &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; voters, a 60 percent swath of Americans larger than either self-described liberals or conservatives.
			</p>
			<p>
				This 21st century coalition allowed Obama to blow out McCain in cities and suburbs where Bush had narrowly won or lost by smaller margins four years ago, and to pull off narrow wins in Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Indiana and Ohio.
			</p>
			<p>
				He ran up huge margins in heavily-black cities and counties in each, but was able to edge out McCain thanks to big wins in populous, racially-mixed localities like Northern Virginia&rsquo;s Fairfax County (59 percent), Charlotte&rsquo;s Mecklenburg County (62 percent), Orlando&rsquo;s Orange County (59 percent), Indianapolis&rsquo;s Marion County (64 percent) and Columbus&rsquo;s Franklin County (59 percent).
			</p>
			<p>
				The coalition underscored the theme that made Obama famous in 2004, and one that he returned to in his victory speech, citing his support from &ldquo;young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled &mdash; Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States: we are, and always will be, the United States of America.&rdquo;<br />

				Coalition? Schmolalition! Obama &#8220;won&#8221; because McCain lost. SDimply stating that had the Republicans had a better candidate to offer, the outcome would most likely have been far different!
			</p>
			<p>
				McCain was widely seen as a doddering, peripathetic clone of G.W.B. and Dubya&rsquo;s failed policies which McCain blindly supported. McCain&rsquo;s war record&hellip; to put it KINDLY, were questionable to say the least. As several first-hand articles by McCain&rsquo;s fellow officers suggest. That McCain could not speak without shooting a bullet into his foot hardly helped. The kiss of death being McCain&rsquo;s selection of Palin as a running mate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Palin was saddled with enough bad baggage of her own, which the media was quick to ferret out and broadcast. Indicating that McCain&rsquo;s staff either selected Palin by tossing darts or flipping a coin. Had they done a better vetting job, she&rsquo;d NEVER have made the cut. Given there were several better qualified ladies to select from.
			</p>
			<p>
				All of us supporting McCain and attempting to praise his virtues did so knowing full well his chances were limited&hellip; non-existent being a better term considering the utter naivette of the younger generation of voters. Who were mesmerized by Obama&rsquo;s skin tone and pompous tone, thanks to the years of brainwashing in the schools they&rsquo;ve attended.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether Obama can do even a miniscule fraction of what he promised. Whether he really IS the man needed for the Office&hellip; or whether Obama will be another inept bungling fool like Jimmy Carter&hellip; will have to be seen. Like it or not. Whether good or bad, Obama will be in the White House for a minimum of four years. Long enough to do a heap of damage to our country or just possibly a world of good. If the former, count on him given a Carteresque bum&rsquo;s rush in 2012. Carter, too, it might be recalled, promised &#8216;change.&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				The change Obama presages might not be what THINKING Americans would hope for or want. Our country probably will be inundated with millions more third-world primitives. From African, Latin American or Asian countries. More useless parasites feeding from the taxes paid by American workers. Bringing more crime (as if we didn&rsquo;t have enough already from our own Blacks), more social problems due to radically different lifestyles these creatures are used to.
			</p>
			<p>
				That Obama and McCain were the best our two party system could offer, speaks volumes for needing a viable third political party in America. A party hewing to the principle: A government of the people, for the people and BY the people. In short a government in tune with, and responsive to the collective will of the American citizens and voters. In other words, the complete anti-thesis of those worthless whores we find in Congress today. The actual number of HONEST congressmen and senators can probably counted on the fingers of one hand.
			</p>
			<p>
				That those Honorable Congressmen, Honorable Senators sell themselves like common whores to the lobbyists, special interests, corporations and businesses bankrolling their campaigns is a dead certainty. But those political whores simply view their years in Congress as a sinecure offering an opportunity to fatten, swine-like, at the public trough. Something Thomas Jefferson and those early greats unfortunately had no way of anticipating.
			</p>
			<p>
				When Clinton ran in 1992, the media fawned over and supported Clinton as an intellectual and an elite. Just as they did with Obama. But we can certainly count on the media turning on Obama rather quickly. Focusing on everything he says or does, as they did to expose the Clintons as the liars and scoundrels they were. So while Obama &#8220;won&#8221;, the real contest has not even started. It will certainly be interesting how the American citizens and voters feel about him in 2012. Obama might have won the distinction of being America&rsquo;s First Afro-American president; he might also be its last, should his presidency be deemed bad enough by our country.
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing for sure. With a Democratic majority in both Houses of Congress, there IS NO excuse for Obama OR Congress to fail in even the slightest. By the same token, should Obama come to be seen as a failure by American voters, you can rest assured those senators and congressmen will distance themselves from Obama as fast, if not faster, as they did from Dubya.<br />

				Of course, all of you realize that is the beginning of the end for the Republicans and for White America. It will become increasingly difficult for the Republicans to win the Presidency and even Congressional seats each election cycle due to demographic changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				All I can say is that we did this to ourselves. Obama is just a taste of much worse things to come. Subsequent Obamas will not have to be as constrained as he will most likely be his 1st term in office.

				PRESIDENT OBAMA&rsquo;S FIRST STEP: RESET EXPECTATIONS (Yahoo News)<br />
				President Obama began this process last night, in his victory speech, when he noted that restoring the country&rsquo;s health might take more than a term. In the next few weeks, he should go well beyond this:
			</p>
			<p>
				The deficit will be more than $1 trillion a year for several years.<br />
				The country needs a massive new fiscal stimulus.<br />
				The housing market will continue to decline through at least 2010.<br />
				Interest rates and taxes will eventually have to rise (after the economy stabilizes).<br />
				Weak corporations have to be allowed to fail.<br />
				Millions of homeowners will lose their house. <br />
				Unemployment will probably rise to 10%.<br />
				The government simply cannot &#8220;bail the country out&#8221; &mdash; not because it lacks the will, but because it lacks the power.
			</p>
			<p>
				In short, Obama needs to acknowedge reality, erring on the side of overstating the problems and challenges, and he needs to prepare the country for several tough years. Because if he doesn&rsquo;t, within six months of his taking office, the country will have forgotten all about the prior administration and will instead be blaming everything on him.

			</p>
			<p>
				Racism turned out to be a footnote, because McCain didn&rsquo;t have the cajones to elaborate on Obama&rsquo;s obvious anti-white preacher and his congregation, plus all the others in the country, which obviously Obama is in lockstep with or he wouldn&rsquo;t have rubbed shoulders with them for over twenty years. Racism by blacks was never so obvious as it was during the run up to the election. The only reason it wasn&rsquo;t highlighted as it should have been, is because the white press and the political elites have become the new spineless replicas of the elitist class, and they would rather be safe than principled.
			</p>

				Where this screw ball writer comes up with some of the nonsense he writes must be from deep within the inner recesses of his brain that is responsible for formulating nosensical, fantasy type dreams and thoughts. It&rsquo;s really disgusting.

				Today I heard some notable talk show hosts, whom I thought were otherwise conservative, speaking of how they wish Obama the best and how he needs our support, and how this election is historical. If they were true conservatives, they would be hoping for him to have a horrible term in office. When I hear people like Sean Hannity and Hugh Hewitt spending up to 15 to 30 minutes of their shows talking about the good things about Obama (an extremist anti-white socialist) getting elected, I know that this country is finished.

				The Republicans basically self-destructed. It was inevitable this would happen once the party had been hijacked by the neoconservatives. C,mon after eight years of Bush-Cheney and co, the waters had been poisoned for a Republican candidate.

				<br />
				Obama won for two reasons: 1) Bush.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not being a presidential historian, I can&rsquo;t say that Bush was the worst president ever but he&rsquo;s got to be in the top 5.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I voted for him in the 2000 election, I had no inkling that as his first priority, he would try to turn the US into a colony of Mexico. It was down hill from there.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bush is not a conservative. A classic conservative would have heeded our Forefathers warning about foreign entanglements.
			</p>
			<p>
				The left hated Bush and eventually conservatives did as well. He and his policies were completely out of touch with people if not reality. (Did he actually believe he could bring American style democracy to the world by bombing a nation into submission and have the world love him if for the only reason his heart and motives were in the right place?)
			</p>
			<p>
				Bush was and is under the spell of the neo-CON-men. They may believe they could shape the world to their image (though I suspect their real motive was to simply permanently cripple any nation they thought might be trouble in the future) instead of recognizing and respecting different nations and people.
			</p>
			<p>
				2) In the hearts and minds of conservatives and liberals alike, ANYONE looks better than Bush. Obama had the plus of being a mulatto and he appealed to guilt and hope obsessed whites that voting for him would bring about a nation, if not a world, of racial harmony.
			</p>
			<p>
				What I fear from this win is that people will use it as an example of people wanting to live in a multicultural nation. I don&rsquo;t believe this is true. Most people, when left alone, still separate by everything from sex, to age, to race but most people don&rsquo;t want to see this truth. They want to BELIEVE fantasies rather than respect reality.

Indicating that McCain&rsquo;s staff either selected Palin by tossing darts or flipping a coin. Had they done a better vetting job, she&rsquo;d NEVER have made the cut. Given there were several better qualified ladies to select from.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, I agree with most of what you have to say, guy, but not this. Not at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				Without Sarah Palin McCain would have doin far worse. It is she who drew the gigantic crowds, not McCain, and it wasn&rsquo;t until she was nominated that the pitiful campaign came alive.
			</p>
			<p>
				She brought the strong conservative base back to the GOP. McCain received 80% of the conservative vote. If we had had a true conservative in there besides McCain, along with Palin, we could have picked up most of those conservatives and won.
			</p>
			<p>
				Make no mistake about it. It was McAmnesty and his warmongering boasts that made the GOP base flee. As Rush Limbaugh said in essence, if he wins &#8220;we&rsquo;ll have to drag him over the finish line,&#8221; because he&rsquo;s doing too many things wrong to help himself.
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s still a mystery to me that the Republican electorate nominated McCain over two more articulate candidates: Romney and Huckabee. I think both would have brought up the Reverend Wright issue, which was a vital mistake to ignore, as McAmnesty did.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, in the final analysis, this entire electoral period of time revealed to many of us that this country is truly dysfunctional and if an economic collapse occurs it will put the necessary touches on a degenerating system of government that started out wonderfully, but became contaminated with ideologues, power mongers, and greed merchants, and that combination will cause its destruction if the current economic collapse doesn&rsquo;t.

				Actually, the reason why Obama won the election is because his opponent, McCain, was probably the worst candidate to run for the GOP. Many conservatives who generally vote Republican didn&rsquo;t vote for McCain in this election, instead not voting at all or voting for a third-party because they felt marginalized. Plus everyone, Republican and Democrat alike, is fed up with George W. Bush&rsquo;s reckless policies were probably hesitant to vote McCain, whose policies probably wouldn&rsquo;t have differed much from the policies of Bush.

				McCain simply would not press the issues of obama&rsquo;s far left nature. He was afraid as most whites are and have always been. There are afraid of the labels others apply to them. He refused to press the issue of the irreverend wright.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am so disgusted. I refuse to listen to the news. The press built obama along with his Chicago gangland political machine.

				Obama won because there is a large population of Native Born White Americans who voted for Reagan and Bus1&2.It was a policy decision Reagan and Bush 1&2 to increase the size of the hispanics,asian and muslim population within the borders of America. As a consequence, Republican party immigration policies created a huge population of non-whites who are now beginning to out vote the Native Born White American population in National elections.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Native Born White population that voted for Reagan, Bush1 and Bush2 wanted a very nasty foriegn policy. This was a high priority. Now they are paying a terrible price for their war mongering:invade the world,invite the world. You folks should never have gone along with the cold war propagadna. You should have paid attetnion to the long term consequences of post-1965 immigration policy. This was the real threat, not Vietnam, Cuba,the Sandanistas, the FMLN in El Salvador and the Maurice Bishop Goverment down in Grenada.

				I hate to spoil the party, but most white voters don&rsquo;t have very complex or cerebral motivations for the way they vote. Why did Obama win? Because the economy is bad, and Bush is a Republican. There were just enough whites in swing states who don&rsquo;t live around blacks, who don&rsquo;t know blacks, and who were frustrated with the economy.
			</p>
			<p>
				You watch, later this week, the media will start talking about how the economy is getting better. Not that it is, it&rsquo;s just that they got their Obama.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think the United States of America is at the same point now as the Western Roman Empire was in 476 A.D., when a German drove out the last emperor of truly Roman stock. Don&rsquo;t forget tha the Western Roman Senate met for 100 years after that, and for that time, people there still thought of themselves as Romans, even though a German was on the throne. Eventually, though, demographics carried the day, and historians mark 476 as the end, even though it didn&rsquo;t seem like it at the time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Someone who I know, who is of like mind to myself, voted for Obama over HRC in the MO-D primary in February. His theory is that Obama was more beatable, and that the United States of America would never elect a black President. My retort at the time was that, yes, there are whites who would never vote for a black President, but those whites, mainly in the deep South, wouldn&rsquo;t vote Democrat anyway. What you had to examine were whites in OH and PA. As it turns out, there were enough whites in states like these that are far enough away from the &ldquo;problem,&rdquo; so their &ldquo;thirst&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t been &ldquo;cured&rdquo; by a &ldquo;good dose&rdquo; (Patterson&rsquo;s First Axiom) &mdash; they voted the economy, and blamed Bush. If such whites lived in MS, they wouldn&rsquo;t have.

				Courtney, I, too, was rather dismayed at Sean Hannity&rsquo;s overly-magnanimous well-wishing for BHO and wondered why he was becoming a bit sycopantic, but then I realized that what he was doing was setting himself up as the one to be able to say, &#8216;I wished him well and extended my hand, but I told you so.&rsquo; Hannity knows that America&rsquo;s soul is at stake and is trying to salvage it by at least pretending to wish BHO the best, but he also expressed some very legitimate and troubling doubts about him. In essence, Hannity is hoping for the best, but expecting the worst.

				&#8220;She brought the strong conservative base back to the GOP. McCain received 80% of the conservative vote. If we had had a true conservative in there besides McCain, along with Palin, we could have picked up most of those conservatives and won.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Exactly what have conservatives ever done for whites?
			</p>
			<p>
				They have done nothing about affirmative action for 45 years. They did nothing about school busing as white children were beaten and terrorized. They claim to be tough on crime but black on white crime gets worse every year. Affirmative action became much, much worse under Reagan and his director of the EEOC, Clarence Thomas.
			</p>
			<p>
				AND IT WAS REAGAN THE SO CALLED CONSERVATIVE WHO CREATED THE 1986 AMNESTY.
			</p>
			<p>
				Can anyone tell me why white nationalists, reeling under affirmative action, black on white crime and the genocidal hatred spewed at us by the likes of Tim Wise, academia and the media THINK CONSERVATIVES WILL EVER HELP US?
			</p>
			<p>
				It would have been nice to see the white hating liberals having a fit if McCain had won. I loved the aftermath 2000 and 2004 elections as the liberals mourned. But McCain, like all Republican presidents is no friend of whites. His cabinet and staff would probably have had more minorities than Obama&rsquo;s. He would have torn down the fence, cut back the border patrol and declared amnesty for illegals.
			</p>
			<p>
				45 years of conservatives cooperating in the destruction of whites should tell you something.
			</p>
			<p>
				The have cooperated with the liberals and communists, Sharpton, Jackson, Farakhan, to destroy us.

				The posting by &#8220;Ed&#8221; above contains a list of things that might go wrong economically in the coming years. By far, the most important one is this:
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Unemployment will probably rise to 10%&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				If Obama is associated with a serious economic downturn, all of his talk about hope and change will really look shallow and stupid in retrospect. His supporters will all feel cheated, and turn on him. This is the scenario I see playing out in the next four years, just as it did for Jimmy Carter.
			</p>

				Bye-bye coalition.

				Back in July, Jared Taylor wrote his editorial &#8220;Why Obama Will Win.&#8221; At the time, I doubted his analysis &mdash; and offered to donate $100 to American Renaissance should the election results prove him right and me wrong. In the Comments section, I also challenged other AmRen readers to pledge to do the same &mdash; and a few of you took me up on that challenge.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today I sent off the money. Anyone else who took up my challenge and promised to send money (you know who you are) should do so soon.
			</p>
			<p>
				And even if you never promised anything back in July, this would be an excellent time to contribute a little something to the AmRen war chest. Considering what the next four years may hold &mdash; including the possibility of the new regime attempting to interfere with Internet sites like this one &mdash; we&rsquo;re going to need all the defenders we can get!

				This country is finished period! It is done, over, kaput. Regardless of who would have won between McCain or Obama this election spelled the final nail in the coffin for our Repbulic. The demographic changes that are facing America in the next 20 years without Amnesty are in and of themselves enough to turn this country into a dysfunctional South American style socialist state. With the Amnesty that both McCain and Obama are pushing for it will be virtually impossible for another conservative to ever be elected to congress or senate in ever growing parts of this country, let alone POTUS. The 12 million Amnesty figure is a red herring designed to fool the American people. It is more like 30 million and when you take into account chain migration of families and relatives it is more like 60-100 million who be coming to our country in a very short time. These people will always if given the right to vote, cast their ballots for the socialists who promise them the most reward.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is entirely likely the last conservative president in this nation&rsquo;s history will be remembered as Ronald Reagan who the left still have much abiding hatred and contempt for long after his death.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is coming to the likelyhood that the only hope for a nation on this continent that our founding fathers would recognize is if this continent Balkanizes on racial lines. Without that prospect, hope is becoming increasingly dim. Our children will be strangers in their own land.

				Exit polls show:<br />
				Whites with 74% of the vote chose McCain 55% over Obama 43%<br />
				Blacks with 13% of the vote chose Obama 95% over McCain 4%
			</p>
			<p>
				At the age and race level, white voters under 29 chose Obama 54% over McCain 44%.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those statistics suggest Obama won with near complete black support and overwhelming support of idealistic college age voters who have yet to work for a living.<br />

				I have already taken the oath&hellip;..NO MORE voting for the lesser of two evils.
			</p>
			<p>
				I could not bring myself to vote for McCain because he was only slightly less repulsive than Obama. I did not vote at all and I am sure a good many fellow conservatives did not vote either.

				Maybe Obama will wake people up better than we have done.

				Obama won because McCain was a lousy candidate that some us grudgingly voted for to keep Obama from winning. I can&rsquo;t count how many times on TV McCain made me want to vomit when he talked about civil rights leaders being patriots or how Kennedy was a good man or some other such nonsense. Sarah Palin was the only thing that dragged me to the polls.

				It wasn&rsquo;t so much as Cheney-Bush as much as a Democratic majority<br />

				whole economic mess. They lay the blame on the 60&rsquo;s C.R.A.<br />
				Community Reinvestment Act) from then on all sorts of bullying <br />
				of banks and other lenders by mostly those ones(blacks). Had<br />
				this and the fact that Barry helped to successfully sue some of <br />
				these banks(ACORN had some involvement too). Bell Savings here<br />
				in Illinois (IBD said) went under due to such legal actions.<br />
				IBD went on to say that several people tried to initiate <br />

			<p>
				Hope this gets posted. It is urged that one read this issue<br />

				The white race is losing the country &mdash; and if I were white, I would probably be as dismayed as you are.<br />
				But, as a black person, I&rsquo;m basically OK with it. I did not vote for Mr. Obama &mdash; my PhD studies have made me rather too cynical to believe much in any hyperbolic political movement &mdash; but find him a true phenomenon, unlike any other in my lifetime. That this is no longer white man&rsquo;s land is obvious. But whites have only themselves to blame, whereas blacks have moved with strategic precision to solicit your guilt and maximize our power. <br />

				McCain wanted to lose and suceeded admirably. He picked a running mate who lacked experiance so he couldn&rsquo;t rightly attack Obamas lack of credentials,he chose not to attack Rev. Wright as the racist Black power preacher he is and he campaigned on the Bush platform of endless war with no victory strategy displayed.<br />
				In short the media discounted the Ron Paul Presidential bid and propped up either McCain or Romney as the opponets to the annoited one with such vigor as to be scandalous in this day and age of one newspaper towns but the Republican leadership never mentioned this and so I have to conclude we got the results they wanted.<br />
				As for me I&rsquo;m voting third party from now on and the devil take the hindmost.

				&#8220;The left hated Bush and eventually conservatives did as well. He and his policies were completely out of touch with people if not reality. (Did he actually believe he could bring American style democracy to the world by bombing a nation into submission and have the world love him if for the only reason his heart and motives were in the right place?)&hellip;.Bush was and is under the spell of the neo-CON-men. They may believe they could shape the world to their image (though I suspect their real motive was to simply permanently cripple any nation they thought might be trouble in the future) instead of recognizing and respecting different nations and people.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				I completely understand why most people in this movement are against the war because a) we should be more focused on our own borders OR b) the arab peoples have IQs so low that we can never turn them into us no matter how hard we tried, so we might as well spend the money on ourselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the above stuff that I quote from sbuffalonative&rsquo;s post just sounds like pure liberal anti-white, anti-war jargon to me. It sounds to me like an argument that Micheal Moore or Jesse Jackson would make (white man = evil colonizing bombing barbarian). Sometimes I don&rsquo;t understand a lot of the people in this movement.

				The poster who said White America is DEAD, is right. Has anyone figured out WHY the democrats put up a Black man? Do you think those voting machines can change votes? Back to my point. The Republicans can never go back to putting up a WHITE man for POTUS. They will have to put up a woman ( a minority one), or a Black or a Mexican from now on. Why? Because they will be labeled RACIST if they don&rsquo;t.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was the plan from the start by those who really run this nation. Once Americans voted Black, it will be much easier and expected next time and the next and the next. Not to mention the younger generation of Whites have been so indoctrinated that race/race mixing doesn&rsquo;t even matter to them anylonger. It&rsquo;s natural to them.
			</p>
			<p>
				I see NO hope for a White America anylonger and our numbers will dwindle to almost nothing in the next 20 years. The baby boomers will be dead by then and dying, so how many Whites does that leave? Half of those Whites will have multi-racial children dwindling our numbers even further. The only solution to this dire and urgent problem is secession. Our own states and land where we can multiply once more without interference from nonwhites and a corrupted government and courts.

				https://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=660502
			</p>
			<p>
				Funnily the polls say 75%- 80% of Australian supported Obama (no one asked me).<br />
				But when you read these comments. They seem to be in four basic categories.
			</p>
			<p>
				1. Obama being elected is inspirational.<br />
				2. Obama being elected is inspirational, and you&rsquo;re a racist if think otherwise.<br />
				3. I don&rsquo;t care who won or their race, as long as Bush is gone.<br />
				4. Voting for someone just because they are black is racist (often followed by no.2 as the retort).
			</p>
			<p>
				Not the overwhelmingily gushing support that the MSM reports. <br />
				And today when looking to post this link, I had to go through my history to find it, as it has been buried away (out of sight) with none of the usual links to it from related articles.<br />

				You certainly have the right to your beliefs, &#8220;Posted by q at 5:53 PM on November 5&#8221; but Palin was an albatross on McCain&rsquo;s neck. Her lack of experience, should the old fool have croaked in office, was enough to give many people second thoughts. Conversely, MANY people would have voted for him, had his V.P. choice been a person with more substance and political acumen, peolple WOULD have voted for McCain hoping he&rsquo;d kick off and a more savy person who was not perceived to be a G.W.B. retread, would have done quite well in the president slot.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sure, Palin drew crowds. She also drew a lot of criticism. Her clothing paid by the Republican warchest. Her charging the state for family members&rsquo; travel. That business of using political influence to get her ex-brother-in-law kicked out of the Highway Patrol (or what the law enforcement group was called).
			</p>
			<p>
				All that dirt was flying the day after McCain announced her to be his running mate.
			</p>
			<p>
				McCain was not &#8220;nominated&#8221;. He simply had more financial resources (his wife&rsquo;s millions). Thus able to outlast and outspend the other Republicans. Had McCain not been so stupidly egotistical and stepped down, claiming &#8220;health issues,&#8221; one of the other front-runners could have replaced him, and very probably WON last night.
			</p>
			<p>
				People did not necessarily VOTE for Obama because they loved him. Because the country needed a Black prez. Or even because they believed obama&rsquo;s promised change baloney. They voted for Obama because he seemed to them, anyway, less distasteful than McCain.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course listening to the nonsense spouted by the media or by Blacks, Obama was regarded either as the Messiah, or certainly a Saint appointed by God himself.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the risk of sounding like a heretic, I suggest the whole Obama well-orchestrated media blitz, which started six or seven years ago, was a well-planned PR stunt to &#8220;prove&#8221; even a Black man could be &#8220;sold&#8221; to the American voters. If you hype him up enough with megatons of FREE publicity in print and electronic media.
			</p>
			<p>
				If I&rsquo;m right, the people BEHIND that PR firm&rsquo;s efforts stand to net hundreds of millions in the months and years to come. Most likely a member of the Annenbergs, Murdock or some other big newspaper/TV station owner(s).

				I am so despondent. I tried to have faith and perserverance during this campaign. Although I wasn&rsquo;t a big McCain fan, he was far better than putting a socialist in the White House, which is what the aging 60&rsquo;s radical have been yearning for for 40 years and now they have him and he&rsquo;s black on top of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can only hope that it won&rsquo;t be as bad as what we think it&rsquo;s going to be but I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope for that. My brother says that now that he&rsquo;s gotten the White House, every low life black from Mike Tyson and Jesse Jackson will be in out of the White House for the next four years.

				q: I agree with you that Romney and Huckabee would have been better candidates than McCain, but I also agree with Fed Up that Sarah Palin&rsquo;s baggage caused a lot of damage to the ticket. I personally liked Palin a lot and she did help to reassure my household about the GOP ticket, as was the case for others on my block. But as part of my job I do number-crunching that also includes polling data.
			</p>
			<p>
				And the sad truth is, as all the talk about earmarks, Bridge to Nowhere and all that other propaganda came out about Palin, it turned her into an albatross for the Republican campaign, as our polling data consistently showed draining support the more came out about her. Especially among Independents who turned the election, but even a disturbing number of conservatives, as our data showed, got irritated when it seemed she was hiding an extramarital affair (whether or not that&rsquo;s accurate), while that dumb Dairygate and earmarks propaganda did hurt with economic conservatives.
			</p>
			<p>
				One conservative neighbor of mine actually came to oppose McCain/Palin for these reasons alone &mdash; fortunately, I was able to convince him that Palin&rsquo;s pros outweighed her cons and he ultimately did vote for McCain/Palin, but tens of millions of other voters (Independents and even conservatives) were turned off. Palin without all those scandals would have been an outstanding addition to the ticket, but unfortunately, the data is extremely consistent and Fed Up is right &mdash; the baggage she carried did a lot of damage.

				The one thing we have to keep in mind is that Barack Obama, although promoted and funded by a slew of white handlers, has had his eyes on the prize for a long, long time.
			</p>
			<p>
				PBS had a show on about a week or so ago that was quite interesting. Obama chose Chicago to set up shop. First he attempted to win the seat of Congressman Bobby Rush but the black Chicago powerbase dissed him and supported Rush, the incumbent (a former black panther who had the support of then President Bill Clinton who actually did radio ads for Rush during the campaign against Obama(I guess this is what causes most of the Obama animosity toward the Clintons)). Then he regrouped and changed his approach. He married Michelle whose family ties to the community spanned generations. Then he hooked up with the Rev. Wright to also get in good with the community (which is where, I believe, he met Oprah). It was in this environment that he met David Axelrod, his campaign biggie. The rest can be figured out.<br />

				I think if you&rsquo;re a loyal Republican, you better cherish the minutes left until January 20, 2009 at 11:59 AM ET. For at that time, it is highly likely that the last Republican President will ride out of town. It might not be unfathomable to think that the last white President will ride out of town then, as there is no shortage of semi-articulate empty-suited mulattoes and mestizoes that the Democrat Party can run up the flagpole, really quickly, one after another after another, quadrenially.

				High turnout among early voters helped smooth elections citywide on Election Day. And volunteers working at precincts deemed by state Democrats to be serving predominantly poor, black voters say a concentrated movement to encourage early voting paid off considerably in ensuring that every voter was able to cast a ballot.
			</p>
			<p>
				Volunteer Won Choi made rounds among several targeted low-income, high-minority precincts, delivering fried chicken aimed to encourage evening voters to stay in line.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yeah, vote early the week before the election and then vote again on election day.

				In NYC today, the blacks were mostly docile. Most had Obama pins. I had a McCain pin on and one black started me down and I started him down right back and he walked away. I think they were fearful of whites get angry at any sense of rubbing it in. As usual Staten Island voted Republican, but the other 4 boroughs voted for Obama by at least 75%

				The liberal always campaign on the &ldquo;economy stupid&rdquo; and then say their man got elected for the very reason they like him. This editorial was written a week ago, with the particulars added last night. I could have written the same thing about a McCain victory.
			</p>
			<p>
				John McCain&rsquo;s smashing victory proves once and for all that America is a country of, by, and for white people. McCain saw Obama&rsquo;s only weakness: he is black. Okay partly white but black enough to condemn him as not white. McCain&rsquo;s strategy of selecting of sexy white beauty as running mate made the beauty of whiteness and the black habit of despoiling it with rape a central issue of the campaign and was nothing short of sheer brilliance. <br />
				His victories in states that the white race haters claimed were going to go to their darling Obama, Blank, Blank, and Blank all went to McCain and combined to drive a stake through the heart of the Dracula of race mixing. <br />
				The cries that McCain was a racist only spurred on the middle Americans. America will be safe from Mongrelization for the 21st century as soon as President McCain sends the illegals back and closes the borders to un-Americans.

				[NOTE:I wasn&rsquo;t sure where I could post this. For what it&rsquo;s worth]:
			</p>
			<p>
				I was listening to local black talk radio on the afternoon of Nov. 4 and I took down some quotes along the way. I&rsquo;m not a stenographer so most of these are not hard quotes but they&rsquo;re very close and hold the intent:
			</p>
			<p>
				The host described this election as &ldquo;Custers last stand&rdquo; to which he was referring to the Republican party.
			</p>
			<p>
				A guest host by the name of Ross Joemo (?) took great joy in the story about the Obama team removing certain reporters from the Obama plane. This had the distinct ring of &lsquo;payback&rsquo; and I strongly believe that&rsquo;s what blacks are going to expect from Obama; pay-back and pay-off.
			</p>
			<p>
				The host said that Obama was &ldquo;revitalizing Democracy&rdquo; in America to which a co-host replied he was revitalizing Democracy around the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				The host said he expected Obama to &lsquo;redistribute money&rsquo; from policing crime to preventing the causes of crime such as poverty.
			</p>
			<p>
				The trio noted that there were few traditional black leaders stumping for Obama. The host said this was because they actually represented the corporate structure and they got their money from playing ambulance chasers. The host added that the black &lsquo;leadership of the past (Jackson and Sharpton) solved nothing&rsquo; and they no longer &lsquo;fit in&rsquo;.
			</p>
			<p>
				They mentioned that this was different from the Million Man March because this time change is real (NOTE: How many times have you heard that one?)
			</p>
			<p>
				They expected Obama to fill many positions such as judges and the Supreme Court with people who would understand black issues and needs (NOTE: This is a common topic of the host who believes blacks are being caught up in the white justice system and only black police and black judges can meter out appropriate justice to blacks.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The host is always going on about policing verse crime prevention. He said he was looking to Obama to find &ldquo;alternatives to prisons&rdquo;. He doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to go to prison unless they are proven to be a threat. (NOTE: Fine by me, just keep them in your community).
			</p>
			<p>
				Since 95-98 percent of blacks would be voting for Obama, they wondered &ldquo;what is our reward&rdquo;?
			</p>
			<p>
				The host noted that social change from the white power structure only come because &lsquo;you have to be a threat to get power, influence, and change&rsquo;.
			</p>
			<p>
				They all agreed that the Obama campaign was brilliant at using technology to get their message out to young people. They noted they got calls and many email updates daily on the campaign. One man noted snidely that he didn&rsquo;t get a single email from McCain (NOTE: Do you think he registered with McCain and would he have wanted to be pestered daily with emails from McCain?)
			</p>
			<p>
				A female caller said, &lsquo;from here on out, it&rsquo;s upward and onward&rsquo; and noted that this was the start of a &lsquo;revolutionary move&rsquo;.
			</p>
			<p>
				The host threw some cold water on the group by noting that there have been many black elected officials and an increase in black professionals and cops but that the black condition has actually gotten worse in some areas.
			</p>
			<p>
				The host said that blacks could now &lsquo;fight all the forces that were holding us down&rsquo; and that this was &lsquo;change WE can believe in&rsquo;.
			</p>
			<p>
				The host described the choice of Palin as appealing to &lsquo;hillbilly types&rsquo;.
			</p>
			<p>
				The host went off on a conspiracy theory as to why the white power structure was letting Obama win. The theory goes that America wants the resources of Africa and they need a black front man to get them. &lsquo;Negotiating for a capitalist America&rsquo; was a phrase he used.
			</p>
			<p>
				&lsquo;A new era for US&rsquo;.
			</p>
			<p>
				A co-hosted ended by saying there was going to be a &lsquo;world-wide celebration&rsquo; over the Obama victory.
			</p>
			<p>
				The hosted ended the program by noting, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re almost there.&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>

				&#8220;Courtney, I, too, was rather dismayed at Sean Hannity&rsquo;s overly-magnanimous well-wishing for BHO and wondered why he was becoming a bit sycopantic, but then I realized that what he was doing was setting himself up as the one to be able to say, &lsquo;I wished him well and extended my hand, but I told you so.&rsquo; Hannity knows that America&rsquo;s soul is at stake and is trying to salvage it by at least pretending to wish BHO the best, but he also expressed some very legitimate and troubling doubts about him. In essence, Hannity is hoping for the best, but expecting the worst.&#8221; Posted by at 6:26 PM on November 5

			<p>
				Very, very astute of you, my friend. It&rsquo;s good to see another perceptive WN on the board.
			</p>
			<p>
				I didn&rsquo;t hear Hannity&rsquo;s remarks, but I heard other crafty individuals on the right talk about getting behind the president, hoping he does well, and be a loyal opposition.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, this HAS TO BE DONE. Otherwise if and when the messiah screws up badly they can&rsquo;t be blamed for wishing him ill and hacking at him from the start.
			</p>
			<p>
				I can tell you all, my fellow WN&rsquo;s, the fierceness of this battle is on the horizon, and there&rsquo;s no way the messiah and his highly paid Marxist, pro-black advisers are going to avoid stepping in it many times, and the lack of wisdom our boy is beset with is going to reveal itself with many gaffs before they can clamp their hands over his mouth. And what a job they&rsquo;re going to have, because as harsh as it may sound&hellip;&hellip;. there&rsquo;s no other way to put it&hellip;&hellip;.. his wife is an idiot that will cause untold grief before all is said and done.
			</p>
			<p>
				And what about blacks in general? Their expectations of being treated like royalty because a black is pres is going to turn to animosity when they find out they&rsquo;re regarded as the same old same old. Plus their imagined injustices will ALL be there the same as if a honky were pres.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame also if blacks and Mexes started an armed conflict between them that required the military to put down. They wouldn&rsquo;t have fasr to go to be in combat mode, because they&rsquo;re fighting intensely right now.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, pop the top on a frosty, get a bag of popcorn, and watch it all unfold in living color.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is history in the making.

				Medvedev Throws Down a Gauntlet to Obama
			</p>
			<p>
				Russia&rsquo;s president Dmitry Medvedev on Wednesday became the first world leader to throw down a gauntlet to US president-elect Barack Obama, declaring that the Kremlin would station missiles in the tiny Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, which borders Poland, in response to US plans for an anti-missile system in Eastern Europe

				Spin it anyway you want, Obama won because of changing demographics ushered in by the Immigration Bill of &#8216;65 . 1970 census, roughly 204 million&hellip; mid seventies-zero population growth achieved in the US .So where did the extra 100 million we now have come from ? It would have to be immigration and most of that figure would be liberals and also non-white,That was the plan all along in 1965.Admittedly, a large portion of our young whites are hopelessly brainwashed into liberalism .

				One factor that helped Obama were all the dim-bulb white women who voted for him because he was charismatic or something like that. I live in a reasonably well off suburb in Northern Virginia and my wife knows two middle-aged white women, college graduates, with children, who voted for Obama even though their husbands work for defense contractors no less. Both of their husbands were dead-set againt Obama.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reasons they give for voting for Obama were basically undefinable and they became upset when questioned too hard according to my wife. I should report that one was thrilled at the news that Obama would get a little puppy when his family moves into the White House&hellip;no I am not making this up. This woman also despises Sarah Palin, again for undefinable reasons.
			</p>
			<p>
				A significant portion of the Obama commercials were aimed at the female vote, and by reviewing the election results they worked only too well. Regardless of the educational and career advancements that many women have achieved over the past few decades some still need be be more cynical with regard to the sugar-coated messages targeted at them by the left in this country.

				&#8220;there is no shortage of semi-articulate empty-suited mulattoes and mestizoes that the Democrat Party can run up the flagpole, really quickly, one after another after another, quadrenially.&#8221;

			<p>
				2012 candidate might be the totally useless Antonio Villarogosa currently Mayor of Los Angeles.
			</p>
			<p>
				He is the same empty suit. College MECHA radical, affirmative action law degree, took the bar exam 4 times and failed. So he was given an office in a union headquarters for a few years, then a do nothing executive director of blah blah at the ACLU, then on to the state legislature and Mayor of Los Angeles.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next step is probably a run for senate or governor.
			</p>
			<p>
				The very same people who created Obama have nurtured Villaragosa since he started college.<br />

				One last comment: I wonder what old Abe would think of this. He alone is to blame for sowing the seeds of America&rsquo;s eventual destruction. He could have made a completely different decision rather than simply emancipating the slaves in the Confederacy and allowing them free reign here on our soil.

				&#8220;Then he hooked up with the Rev. Wright to also get in good with the community (which is where, I believe, he met Oprah).&rsquo;

			<p>
				I read somewhere that he actually asked around town about which black church had the most powerful and important members. Sort of like a social climber in an Edith Wharton novel.
			</p>
			<p>
				Interesting that he became a church goer. After all he was raised by communist mom and grandparents. Then attended the most anti christian colleges in America. Occidental in California is similiar to Oberlin or Reed college in Washington, small but totally commie and atheist.
			</p>
			<p>
				And the fact that Wright&rsquo;s church attracted all those movers and shakers says a lot about the Chicago blacks.

				&#8220;I wonder how many white women, especially white single women and widows, voted for Obama out of sheer terror at the riots and rapes sure to follow a defeat of Obama? &#8220;
			</p>
			<p>
				White women who voted for Obama are in total denial about the reality of black on white rape.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a matter of fact I know 2 white rape victims who voted for Obama. A close friend was gang raped in her apartment by 4 illegal hispanics. They also stole her car, TV, computer and other electronics. She was terrorized for at least 2 hours.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another rape victim I know also voted for Obama. She was kidnapped in a parking lot and beaten and raped for 4 hours by a black man. He stole her car and was caught a month later driving her car.
			</p>
			<p>
				They voted for Obama, but at least they no longer blame the evil white patriachy for rape.
			</p>
			<p>
				Liberalism is indeed a mental disease.

				To the poster who said the U.S.A. is like the Roman Empire in its final 100 years, you are right! There are so many parallels, including troops spread all over the world, the loss of our money&rsquo;s value, bread and circuses (welfare and &#8220;entertainment&#8221;), the dumbing down of the people, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				I got to thinking: I don&rsquo;t want to live in Kenya, or Mexico, or Bangladesh. Is it too much to ask that my country be a place where white people can feel comfortable? It won&rsquo;t be long at all before the U.S. has a teeny, tiny, miniscule, small (did I mention tiny?) white minority that is blamed for everything, despised for everything, in great danger, and taxed to the max.
			</p>
			<p>
				For all the unaware whites who think it is racist to worry about our declining white percentages amid this sea of non-white immigration, does it bother you that chances are high your descendants will marry non-white Americans, and your progeny will not be white?
			</p>
			<p>
				Take a look at what is happening in England. It is considered &#8220;cool&#8221; in London for young whites to marry outside their race. Their British genes that were unbroken to as far back as William the Conqueror will be lost.

				Received this from a paleoconservative email list:
			</p>
			<p>
				<br />
				McCain was terrible, a guest-worker amnesty loving neocon.
			</p>
			<p>
				But make no mistake about it. The victory of Obama in the recent election is nothing short of a declaration of war upon European Americans (i.e. whites).
			</p>
			<p>
				This Cultural Marxist, Barack Hussein Obama, at one time or another has supported:
			</p>
			<p>
				(1) Reparations. Redistributing money from European Americans to blacks, mestizos, and Asians.
			</p>
			<p>
				(2) Criminalizing white parents who refuse to let their children practice miscegenation.
			</p>
			<p>
				(3) Using &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; to silence any criticism from European Americans.
			</p>
			<p>
				(4) Using Third World immigration to overwhelm European American majorities.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br />
				This is a sad day indeed. Don&rsquo;t let the Cultural Marxists divide us. Now, more than any time in American history, European Americans must stand together. Our white brothers and sisters need us. (What is race but extended family?)

				About one week after early voting started here in my part of Texas, I happened to be in a local burger joint for breakfast around five in the morning.
			</p>
			<p>
				At least two of the farmers who said they had voted early also said that they didn&rsquo;t vote for anyone for President/Vice-President. Left the square empty. The others agreed with them.
			</p>
			<p>
				So how many voters voted down ticket and skipped the first box? We&rsquo;ll never know. The total votes for down ticket races may total more than the vote total for P/V-P.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is noteworthy that at no time did Obama or McCain ever present any information detailing their respective agricultural policies for this country once they became President. I noted the same awareness in reading the local ag column in the Wichita Falls paper. Also saw this awareness among farmers and ranchers elsewhere.
			</p>
			<p>
				The farming/ranching/ag community in this country is huge. I guess these two clowns &mdash; Obama and McCain &mdash; think their food comes from the grocery store. I imagine they really don&rsquo;t have any idea where their food comes from&hellip;it just magically shows up on the shelf. I can see neither Obama or McCain getting any support from the ag voting block. That might have made the race right there.
			</p>
			<p>
				Water rights, land use policy, crop supports, export promotion, etc. just went unaddressed.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have seen the vote breakdown as set out above. But I really would like to see vote totals down ticket and compare them with the vote total in the P/V-P race, just to see if more people voted down ticket than voted up ticket. That would be interesting.

				&#8220;If Obama is associated with a serious economic downturn, all of his talk about hope and change will really look shallow and stupid in retrospect. His supporters will all feel cheated, and turn on him.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Reader-1, I&rsquo;m sorry, but this is not going to happen. The economy right now is already in such a horrendous state &mdash; and still getting worse &mdash; that by the time Obama takes office in January, we&rsquo;ll already be stuck in the midst of a second Great Depression.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given that starting point, Obama doesn&rsquo;t *have* to improve the economy much, it&rsquo;ll already be in such awful shape, that even meager improvements would look &#8220;impressive.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember, when FDR was elected in 1932, the Great Depression got no better and in some ways was a lot worse in 1936 and 1940, simply because people got used to the economy being dismal and didn&rsquo;t want to &#8220;swap horses in midstream.&#8221; Obama is benefiting from similar timing.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you consider this fact, on top of the demographic changes in the USA &mdash; with Blacks and Latinos becoming the majority within a decade as Whites shrink to a dwindling and powerless minority &mdash; then you realize that there is no future for the United States. As people have been saying here, the United States is basically destined to become something like a Socialist South American country, a North American Brazil or South Africa.
			</p>
			<p>
				So the only possible future for our people here would be some kind of partitioning like what happened with Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia (hopefully the latter, which was basically nonviolent). Unless you have some relatives or a nice job in a place like Norway or Germany, and can speak a language or two, only partition will save your families here.

				The election of Obama as President is certainly a dark day for America. However, all is not lost for the First World, white America as we have known it. Simply looking at the election results - the red versus the blue - one can easily see the divide across the nation. Looking more closely, though, at such states as Pennsylvania, Florida, and Ohio the areas that voted for Obama are the large &#8220;diverse&#8221; counties with major cities while the more rual areas went for McCain. To shift the balance of power back nationally whites simply need to consolidate their power in those rural red areas - local school boards, city councils, and county governments to start. Then they need to elect state senators and representatives to represent their interests at the state level to counter the minority interests of those in the major blue cities. Finally, they need to begin to elect Congressional representatives that will vote as a block in the US House of Representatives. There are 435 representatives in the US House, what would happen to national legislation if even 10% of them acted as a &#8220;white&#8221; caucus to vote white interests? The biggest obstacles to achieving those objectives are 1. liberal media bias and brainwashing which would have less of an effect in a small town than a major city 2. financial backing although a local campaign costs less than a national campaign and 3. whites need to REALLY get over the fear of being called &#8220;racist&#8221; as though they are children in elementary school and start defending their own interests again.

				You&rsquo;ve had a lot of help, my friend, from very powerful groups that use blacks as a battering ram against Whites in order to atomize them. They believe that Whites cannot be allowed to form a majority anywhere lest they create a Fourth Reich.

				Did you know the NAACP was neither founded nor funded by blacks?<br />
				They have created and formed your organizations for you but you are certainly not allowed to join their organizations.

				BHO won because he outspent McCain. BHO promised to accept spending limits and then back down. He was able to spend twice as much as McCain. BHO ran the filthiest campaign I ever seen. <br />
				McCain was probably hoping all those Hispanic voters would remember him and vote foe him. Ha&hellip;Ha&hellip;Ha&hellip;sucka.

				I have no sympathy for the Republican Party. They fielded a team of waterboys. None of the big hitters were working in the campaign and the waterboys were playing with their shoelaces tied and one hand stuck in their sock.
			</p>
			<p>
				The so-called conservative party chased off all the conservatives in the party when they nominated McCain: the renegade, the traitor, the feeble minded. Even his advisors were &hellip;.lemmie see&hellip;..limited?
			</p>
			<p>
				Had McCain found an issue he could press into Obama&rsquo;s face (and there was no shortage of issues), McCain could not bring himself to be unpleasant or impolite. I was reminded of another plutocrat, John Kerry, windsurfing and much too politically correct to run a campaign for the presidency. Go back and review a few Reagan speeches if you need some examples.
			</p>
			<p>
				What every Republican should have learned from this election was a few simple rules:
			</p>
			<p>
				1. Pandering and kissing hinnie does not work. No amount of hugs and knee bending will win even one demographic.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. Be prepared to lie, cheat, steal, and a host of other inconsiderate and impolite acts to win the election.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. No amount of money can win a presidential election. The election will be won by electoral votes, not who spends the most on television advertisement.
			</p>
			<p>
				4. No vice presidential running mate can energize the base of the party for you. THAT IS YOUR JOB. Pick a VP running mate that can deliver state(s) that you obviously cannot win. (Next time pick a governor of a BLUE state, not a red state.) Make sure it is a state that has at least twenty electoral votes&hellip;..you know, Florida, California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas.
			</p>
			<p>
				5. Take every single issue that the vast majority of the American people feel strongly about and make it a big part of your campaign platform. Include all these issues in every speech and do not give the media anything else to write about. Keep siding with the American people&hellip;.who will do the voting&hellip;.not the Wall Street bankers, not the US Chamber of Commerce, not the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
			</p>
			<p>
				Five new rules is a good start. Surely, you can think of a few more on your own.<br />

				Minorities are not blind to color lines: They&rsquo;ll always vote for a non-white candidate going up against a White one. With their inferiority complex, resentment and envy, coupled with the awareness that they had nothing to do with the greatness of the country, it&rsquo;s but natural.

				Coalition? Schmolalition! Obama &ldquo;won&rdquo; because McCain lost. <br />
				If the Republicans had a better candidate to offer, the outcome would most likely have been far different!
			</p>
			<p>
				McCain was widely seen as a doddering, peripathetic clone of G.W.B.  and of  Dubya&rsquo;s failed policies which McCain blindly supported.  His war record&hellip; to put it KINDLY, was questionable at the least.   The kiss of death was McCain&rsquo;s selection of Palin as a running mate.<br />
				&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
			</p>
			<p>
				Exactly! Great post. Obama&rsquo;s victory was due solely to the lackluster candidate[s] he was running against.  If the Stupid Party had offered two half-way competent opponents, instead of a wacky airhead and a senile geezer, the Obamination could have been trounced easily.
			</p>
			<p>
				In short, it wasn&rsquo;t how attractive Obama was (he wasn&rsquo;t); it was how scary his opponents were.

				I agree with the Gen X:<br />
				&#8216;Funnily the polls say 75%- 80% of Australians supported Obama (no one asked me). But when you read these comments&hellip;Not the overwhelmingily gushing support that the MSM reports.&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Again the controlled media in Australia display their true colours by pushing anti-white propaganda. As it happens, no one asked me either nor anyone I have within my sphere of friendship and aquaintance, even though most of them are well educated and could give good reasons for their opinions. The general trend among these independent thinking Aussies (Those who are able to make decisions outside the confines of guidance from their TV set.) is that they think the election of Obama is a bad thing for the USA and for the West as a whole.
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope our American brothers aren&rsquo;t too despondent, as I believe this is a wake-up call for both racially conscious whites and fence sitters everywhere. I think we will see our movement strengthen itself and consolidate in the United States. And let&rsquo;s face it, it is highly likely that Obama is NOT going to leave the USA in a better state than he found it; in fact, I think we will find that the situation will be exactly the opposite.
			</p>
			<p>
				Minorities will become increasingly arrogant and whites will feel increasingly threatened, which will motivate more to take action resulting in the expansion of numbers within the ranks of our movement. A small organised group of strong, intelligent whites with ideological direction is a force to be reckoned with when comes to standing up to a mass of undisciplined, politically correct, anti-white rabble.
			</p>
			<p>
				I for one, along with many many Americans, DO NOT recognise Obama as President of the United States. It seems that &#8216;democracy&rsquo; has failed and is nothing more than tyranny of the media-controlled masses. We all know that this situation is not and never was what the Founding Fathers intended.

				&#8220;The Republicans basically self-destructed. It was inevitable this would happen once the party had been hijacked by the neoconservatives.&#8221; <br />
				&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br />
				Exactly. It was a shrewd strategy. They were infiltrated by a bunch of ex-Trotskyites who pretended to have seen the light; and this Trojan horse then destroyed the GOP from within, which they could not have done from without.
			</p>
			<p>
				Come to think of it, it&rsquo;s exactly analogous to the present Mexican/alien invasion of the USA &mdash; conquest from within. Will we never wake up and see it happening?

				Why Obama Won
			</p>
			<p>
				Face AR readers, the white man is not in fashion at the moment. Do we blame blacks, non-whites? No, we need to start blaming ourselves. We have allowed ourselves to get comfortable, fat, and lazy.<br />
				We instead of reaching out to each other, we went back to our homes and griped as we watched TV.
			</p>
			<p>
				If this win hasn&rsquo;t woken anyone here up, then I think you should put your head in sand.<br />
				We need to get ourselves in shape, educate ourselves by setting up alternative history classes for our kids. Alternative history on the Great European people, not what the current boards of education want our kids to learn.<br />
				We need to find allies in some non-whites, perhaps Asians and start looking towards Hispanics from a different angle. Many of them dislike blacks just as much as we do.<br />
				We need to re-take Hollywood, kind of back to the old days when Hollywood was great.<br />
				We need to come down hard on the record companies for the garbage they have produced.
			</p>
			<p>
				My list can go on and on, but all I really want to say is we need to look at what they have done, and do it much better than they have ever thought they could.

				God bless you - what a wonderful post!! I am so sick to death of this &#8220;political Conservativism = White Savior mentality!&#8221; You are completely correct; Conservatism, insofar as their even is a coherent ideology of that name anymore, is NOT the magical forumla for White success so many seem to think it is. This election, and the behavior of the Republican party, talk-radio loudmouths and the FNC crowd should have made this clear to most a long time ago.
			</p>
			<p>
				For what it is worth, I despise liberalism with a whole heart, so this is hardly an attempt to support the &#8220;opposition.&#8221; But we Whites need to see that our future is not tied to either of these dead-end ideologies! We need to have fresh ideas and forward-looking thinkers. 1957 America is gone and it is NOT coming back. Clinging to a mindset born of that dead idea is of no use to us - and ultimately holds us back! The only thing we need to &#8220;conserve&#8221; at this point is ourselves, our people, our race!

				Of course, all of you realize that is the beginning of the end for the Republicans and for White America. It will become increasingly difficult for the Republicans to win the Presidency and even Congressional seats each election cycle due to demographic changes
			</p>
			<p>
				I don&rsquo;t think we need worry about a 2nd term since the U.S. will implode during this term. I find it unexpected that either there were no riots as expected or the MSM is not reporting it. Expect gigantic numbers of mulatto babies to be born around September. I am more interested in seeing how many blacks he blatantly appoints to the cabinet and other positions. I see Powell in there and that fool governor of Mass I think Deville or what ever, &#8220;No black left behind&#8221; is the new government motto and the government will soon be the largest employer of blacks. I say again, the black population of the U.S. is more like 40%.

				McCain lost and Obama won for a multitude of reasons, some large, some small, but all, when properly weighted, adding up to a McCain loss. Based on my own observations and conversations with Obama supporters, I believe the factors contributing to the McCain loss / Obama win include, in no particular order
			</p>
			<p>
				- Bush (Iraq war, economic meltdown)<br />
				- McCain&rsquo;s age<br />
				- Palin&rsquo;s lack of readiness to be POTUS<br />
				- Obama&rsquo;s race<br />
				- Obama&rsquo;s articulateness (fatigue from listening to Bush for 8 years, plus McCain&rsquo;s erratic articulateness &mdash; sometimes on, more often off)<br />
				- McCan&rsquo;s lack of authentic conservatism<br />
				- Overwhelming media support for Obama<br />
				- Illegal campaign contributions from overseas to Obama and the overall disproportionality of money the two campaigns had available<br />
				- Obama&rsquo;s well-run campaign versus McCain&rsquo;s poorly-run one<br />
				- Palin&rsquo;s appearance as a lightweight (too many outfits that looked like Vogue rather than ones more suitable for the business world, too many earrings that dangled, hair too long for her age that suggests a certain vanity and lack of maturity).<br />
				- White guilt<br />
				- Overall decline in the intelligence of the population that makes capitalism a harder and harder sell
			</p>
			<p>
				I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope for whites or conservative thought in this country any longer. Our downfall was allowing in too many low-IQ people from the Third World with no history or understanding of capitalism, which has ramped up political correctness (to avoid riots, etc) to the point where history, and American history in particular, can no longer be taught because no one can agree on what it should be. We already had enough problems just trying to bring blacks into the mainstream.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe our only hope is to migrate to solidly red states, making them even more red but without making any noise about it, so that at least we make our thoughts and voting patterns known with a certain amount of power. Any plans for seccession should be a long-term and unspoken plan to avoid having the federal government come down on us like a hammer and to avoid being ostracized as South Africa was before whites lost power.<br />

				What is it that you do not understand? I along with other White Nationalist oppose wars of aggresion against nations that pose no threat to America. WE do not believe the war mongering propaganda that Fox news puts out on a daly basis. Republicans such as youself foolishly voted for the likes of Ronald Reagan and Bush1 and 2 and Nixon because they were pro-war. All four of these Republican presidents increased non-white immigration significantly. All four did nothing on affirmative action. Afirmative action was hatched and forced on White Americans by the Nixon adminstration. Courtney, you and your fellow Republicans voted for own racial dispossession. And you did it because you guys enjoy going to war. It is part of White Republican culture. The price you now pay for violently attacking nations that posed 0 threat to America is the spectacle of post-1965 non -whites having the political power to hasten your racial dispossession within the borders of America.

				Obama won because of the declining economy, and yet, there is something strangely scripted about the rise of Barak Obama. The whole Obama phenomenon has been expertly managed by the elites. His Republican opponent in the Senate race was brought down by a scandal, and the Republican Party brings in a black candidate, Alan Keyes, from outside the state to run against him? The media has been heavily greasing his way to the white house even during the primaries. The Fourth Estate has fronted for him in a totally shameless way. I think Obama, far from being a &#8220;genuine&#8221; black candidate is a probably puppet of the privileged moneyed elite. He has already offered the job of chief of staff to Rahm Emmanuel &mdash; a Clinton insider and Chicago machine politician. Let&rsquo;s see who&rsquo;s on his cabinet. The pro-multicultural elite wanted a minority stooge that they could control. Does a president Obama fit that bill? Retaining power is the privileged elite&rsquo;s only goal.

				&#8220;Courtney, I, too, was rather dismayed at Sean Hannity&rsquo;s overly-magnanimous well-wishing for BHO and wondered why he was becoming a bit sycopantic, but then I realized that what he was doing was setting himself up as the one to be able to say, &lsquo;I wished him well and extended my hand, but I told you so.&rsquo; Hannity knows that America&rsquo;s soul is at stake and is trying to salvage it by at least pretending to wish BHO the best, but he also expressed some very legitimate and troubling doubts about him. In essence, Hannity is hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. &#8220;

				&gt; I also saw Hasselbach this morning capitulating in the most groveling manner. And her former critics replied, &#8220;Welcome to the light. Welcome to the people for truth and justice.&#8221; What everyone seems to be missing is that the U.S. has effectively been bought by a man who promised to abide by campaign finance rules and then reversed himself so that he could hire people to send out volunteers who would accuse non-committed voters or Repulicans of racism if they did not &#8220;pledge&#8221; allegiance to Obama. They also miss that we have become in effect a one party nation.

				Edward Kennedy&rsquo;s strategy of replacing the native white population of the U.S. with non-whites is now bearing fruit. The Democratic party is now guaranteed to be the party of the U.S.&rsquo;s third-world future.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for racism being only a footnote, 95% of blacks voted for Obama. In other words, they voted for him because he&rsquo;s black. A large majority of other non-white groups voted for him because he&rsquo;s not white (or not entirely white). Is this not &#8220;racism&#8221;?

				There was also an enormous amount of vote fraud involved. The Georgia election commission discovered that over 100,000 Georgians were also registered to vote in either Ohio, Florida or both.
			</p>
			<p>
				With early voting, and well organized buses, some of them could have voted in all 3 states.

			<p>
				Obama may have actually won in Ohio. But that state was so very corrupt that no one will ever know who actually won. And of course the head of the election commission was Brunner, a black affirmative action woman.

			<p>
				The Republicans deserve whatever they get, including just disappearing. They have done everything they could in the last 60 years to destroy their only base, American whites while groveling to the non whites who never voted for them and bringing millions of hispanics every year to add to the democrat base.

				&#8220;Palin without all those scandals would have been an outstanding addition to the ticket, but unfortunately, the data is extremely consistent and Fed Up is right &mdash; the baggage she carried did a lot of damage.&#8221;

				It is only because the media made a meal out of every little gaffe coming from her and completely ignored the silly stuff Obama and his wife came up with from time to time.

			<p>
				The thing about Palin&rsquo;s clothing is also ridiculous. Obama spent more than $150000 on one ad but that went totally unnoticed. It is the media that drummed up the clothing issue and the American public fell for it hook, line and sinker.

				Wars that have produced no tangible benefit whatever to our people, are responsible for the deaths of unconscionable numbers of our best and brightest young White men. If you believe only leftists and white-hating types are anti-war, you are not only mistaken, but you just aren&rsquo;t looking very hard for alternative positions.

				War can indeed be both noble and necessary for the right reasons. Dragging our enormous, unimaginably costly military all over god&rsquo;s creation to fight other peoples&rsquo; battles and squabbles for decades and decades now, doesn&rsquo;t exactly meet that criteria!

				Intesting points (about going to wars) raised by JUPITER. I almost bought his resoning&hellip; till I remembered Kennedy sending &#8220;advisors&#8221; to the South Vietnames. Then LBJ taking a fictitious incident (a claimed attack by North Vietnamese PT boat) into an excuse to drag us into that quagmire.

				FRD (a Democrat) was behind the harsh policies that drove Japan into the Pearl Harbor attack. Just as he rightly (or wrongly) did a lot to provoke the Axis forces in Europe.

				The point, JUPITER being the Democrats are just as bad as the Republicans. Historically, we might note, WARS have always been good for the economy. Ask the munitions factories CEOs.

The baby boomers will be dead by then and dying, so how many Whites does that leave? Half of those Whites will have multi-racial children dwindling our numbers even further. The only solution to this dire and urgent problem is secession. Our own states and land where we can multiply once more without interference from nonwhites and a corrupted government and courts.

But I predict that Russia will remain a White nation and many of the last Whites will actually retreat to it. The rest of the world will devolve into a world wide Africa, with piracy, genocides, disease epidemics and other devasting problems that will drop the world population by hundreds of millions if not billions.

				You are mising a crucial point. I am not defending the Democrats. My point is that Conservative Republican White Americans voted for Republicans candidates because the Republicans are stronger on national deense than the Democrats-in their minds. But &#8220;stronger on national defense&#8221; is about attacking nations that pose no threat to America.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is these White Republican who if we are honest created the Barack Obama delerium we see today. If these White Republicans were isolationist and didn&rsquo;t vote for Nixon,Reagan,Bush1 and2- and Bobby Jindal in 2012- a White Nationalist anti-war political party would have filled the vacum.
			</p>
			<p>
				Barack Obama&rsquo;s rise to political power could be a tremondous opportunity to rid the country of the Republican party.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a majority of nonDemocratic party White Americans became anti-war, a very strong political movement would develope that would result in Barack Obama being tried for war crimes at the Hague for it is highly likely that he will attack Iran and destroy Afghanistan completly. If this ever happened, we could really stick it to Barack Obama&rsquo;s black and white supporters.
			</p>
			<p>
				The best way to prevent a another terrorist attack on US soil would be to shut down to 0 all muslim immigration and kick all of America muslims out. IF this were done, there would be no need to have long term and very costly occupation of Afghanistan.Unfortunately, White Republicans will continue to vote for open border war criminals such as McCain.

				&#8220;At the risk of sounding like a heretic, I suggest the whole Obama well-orchestrated media blitz, which started six or seven years ago, was a well-planned PR stunt to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; even a Black man could be &ldquo;sold&rdquo; to the American voters. If you hype him up enough with megatons of FREE publicity in print and electronic media.

				You&rsquo;re probably right. Tom Bradley was the first and only black Mayor of Los Angeles. His election was arranged by the same type of white liberals (neo-cons) who put in the neo-con puppet Obama.

				Those who backed Bradley made billions and billions as developers while Bradley and his affirmative action administrations destroyed the city. Bradley had 4 terms so he was in a long time. Had it not been for the fact that Bradley helped instigate the Rodney King riots by whipping up the mob for hours, he might still be Mayor.<br />

				&#8220;In the spirit of reaching across the aisle, we owe it to the Democrats to show their president the exact same kind of respect and loyalty that they have shown our recent Republican president.&#8221;<br />

				Sounds reasonable enough. But on second thought, I have to wonder if that&rsquo;s tongue-in-cheek sarcasm!!!

				&#8220;The day PALIN was sprung on the media, the muckrakers started airing stuff about Palin&rsquo;s bad baggage. The Bridge, the Earmarks&hellip; etc., etc. Her ex-brother-in-law scandal. <br />
				Initially delighted with McCain&rsquo;s selection, I quickly became dismayed realizing how much anti-McCain-Palin ammunition was readily available after those stories were daily fare (almost) on NPR.&#8221;<br />
				&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; -<br />
				Muckrackers??? That sort of discussion is just NORMAL, whenever anyone is running for political office. It&rsquo;s to be expected. The voters want to hear all sides of the story and learn as much as they can. Would you expect that the media should peresent only a one-sided, sanitized image of a candidate, but not reveal anything that isn&rsquo;t complimentary?
			</p>
			<p>
				That&rsquo;s what would happen in a dictatorship, but we&rsquo;re not there yet.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a candidate has &#8220;bad baggage&#8221;, then he/she shouldn&rsquo;t be running. As the saying goes: &#8220;If you can&rsquo;t stand the heat, then stay out of the kitchen.&#8221;

				how many white fools WASTED their vote on someone who had zero chance of winning? They made a statement alright it was I am an idiot, this vote for McCain culd have causedObama to lose. Wake up there is a time to make a statement and tossing away a vote is not one of them. <br />

				Listen genius, we &#8220;white fools&#8221; made a statement, all right! And this &#8220;idiot&#8221; was one of them. Our statement was that we didn&rsquo;t want EITHER ONE OF THEM! And we STILL don&rsquo;t. <br />
				They both would have aded up to the same result in the long run. You call other people idiots? You fail to understand that it wasn&rsquo;t a choice of one or the other. It was a choice of NEITHER.

				Maybe McCain would have won if he had criticized Obama for defending the L.A. rioters and the Jena 6.

				&#8220;Minorities are not blind to color lines: They&rsquo;ll always vote for a non-white candidate going up against a White one.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				That&rsquo;s the bottom line.
			</p>
			<p>
				There better be a &#8220;White People&rsquo;s Party&#8221; next election, while we are a (dwindling) majority or we condemn ourselves to certain death.

				The anti white racists are already planning to appoint lif long tenured, unremoveable white hating Judges. As I have said so many times, it&rsquo;s the Judges we have to fear the most.

				Democrats and allied advocacy groups expect President-elect Barack Obama to put a progressive stamp on the federal judiciary, saying it has veered too far right under President Bush. After capturing the White House and strengthening their grip on Congress, Democrats will turn to the third branch of government &mdash; and the only one firmly under strong conservative influence.
			</p>
			<p>
				They claim that Obama, who discussed the role of the courts during his campaign, has received a strong mandate from voters to reshape the judiciary. &ldquo;He will have a major impact on the federal judiciary,&rdquo; said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.),

				Who would have ever guessed that the entire world financial system would be brought down by giving mortgages to deadbeat American blacks and Hispanics.
			</p>
			<p>
				These groups used to confine their destruction to the countries they inhabited. Now they&rsquo;ve become a force for universal devastation, thanks to the Democrat Party, Karl Rove, and George W. Bush.

				Are whites in zimbabwe &#8220;off the hook&#8221;?

				Whites in america just volunteered to be slaves for a few short years, providing for blacks and mexicans. After that, it&rsquo;s a trip to the gas chamber.

				Don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the plan? Think again. William Ayers and the Weather Underground were very open about thier plan to exterminate 25 million &#8220;wrong thinking&#8221; white people, once they took over the government.
			</p>

				Guess what&hellip;.they just took over the government.

				Isn&rsquo;t it was odd how McCain made a startling comeback in the primaries when his campaign was almost broke? What would inspire South Carolinians to vote for someone who was 8th or 9th down on the list when there were better choices? I wonder if these elections are fixed from the beginning. Then when McCain was ahead in the polls we get this financial crisis just before the election and it throws the vote to Obama. Strange.

				I&rsquo;m convinced now that Fred Thompson was in it as a spoiler for McCain to keep it away from Romney, and to a lesser extent, Rudy Giuliani. If RG would have actually tried in states before Florida, he might have taken enough RINO/moderate votes in NH to keep McCain from winning. Fred Thompson meant that McCain won SC instead of Huckabee.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not like I&rsquo;m great fans of Huckabee or Romney. My preferred candidate was Duncan Hunter, with Ron Paul being a very very very close 2nd, and Tom Tancredo being a very very very close 3rd.
			</p>

				Also, the Republican system of &#8220;winner take all&#8221; in primaries and caucuses didn&rsquo;t help. The Democrat proportional system is fairer, and if the Republicans had it in 2008, the process would have gone on much longer, and it meant that non-McCain Republicans after Super Tuesday would have had a dog in the fight.

				Such as? As the very first immigration statute (1790) limited citizenship to &#8220;free white persons,&#8221; what reason is there to think they would have approved of handing the presidency to an apostate Muslim Kenyan mulatto?

				I don&rsquo;t think I am naive. The non-black/non-white people voted for Obama because we haven&rsquo;t done a good job in getting ourselves out in front. Just like any war, a country needs its allies. Why should whites not look for allies. So many of them hate, I mean hate blacks. Blacks at the moment are the enemy. We can change many Hispanics and we can change many Asians&rsquo; minds. And, with Obama in the the big seat, I am sure we can and should try to garner the Jewish people to our cause because they too are mostly European extracts, they just didn&rsquo;t have anywhere to run to in the past. I am sure they would much prefer to be with us then with blacks, but we haven&rsquo;t bothered trying to sway them.

			<p>
				Additionally, McCain was just the wrong guy, even for us. Why should we have expected others to vote for him?

				I liked Ann Coulter&rsquo;s last article laying the blame squarely on the dolts in the Republican Primary who went for McCain. A lot of Republican voters are just as ignorant as people accuse the Obamamaniacs of being and knew ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the guy other than that he was a &#8220;war hero&#8221;(I do give him credit for that) and assumed him to be something he wasn&rsquo;t. Although after Bush it is hard to imagine anyone tainted by his actions winning on a republican ticket. Frankly I used to be a liberal democrat and despite waking up on racial reality I found little appealing about the republican party of big business, darwinian capitalism, and an amoral, money is all that matters, philosophy. I much prefer a Lou Dobbs type whose looking out for the working man and could forgo all the silly anti-abortion rhetoric of the Christian right that also turns me off to the GOP. As far as I am concerened the Obituary for the GOP is a silver lining to this unpleasant specticle of having the media force Barak Hussein Obama on us.

				Tongue-in-cheek sarcasm or not the above quote was lifted from Ann Coulter in her November 5th column &#8220;THE REIGN OF LAME FALLS MAINLY ON MCCAIN&#8221;.

				Hardly. Steve Sailer has noted in his new book, &#8220;The Half-Blood Prince,&#8221; this ENTIRE decade has been nothing, if not ALL ABOUT RACE.
