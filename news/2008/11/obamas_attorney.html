<h1>Obama&rsquo;s Attorney General</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Isikoff, Newsweek, November 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President-elect Obama has decided to tap Eric Holder as his attorney general, putting the veteran Washington lawyer in place to become the first African-American to head the Justice Department, according to two legal sources close to the presidential transition.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holder, 57, has been on Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;short list&#8221; for attorney general from the outset. A partner at the D.C. law firm of Covington &amp; Burling, Holder served as co-chief (along with Caroline Kennedy) of Obama&rsquo;s vice-presidential selection process. He also actively campaigned for Obama throughout the year and grew personally close to the president-elect. {snip} </p>
<p>The sources said the Obama transition team is still debating over who should serve under Holder in the key post of deputy attorney general. One top candidate, favored by Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and other former Clinton White House officials, is Elena Kagan, dean of the Harvard Law School and a former lawyer in the White House counsel&rsquo;s office under Clinton. Another top candidate, favored by other Obama advisors, is David Ogden, a former chief of staff to Attorney General Janet Reno, who is currently heading Obama&rsquo;s Justice Department transition team. Kagan brings legal policy credentials; Ogden has more experience in the Justice Department trenches.</p>
<p>The only hesitancy about Holder&rsquo;s selection was that he himself had reservations about going through a confirmation process that was likely to revive questions about his role in signing off on the controversial pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich. {snip}</p>

			<p>Amazing.  Absolutely amazing, and sickening.  President-elect Obama will do exactly what we expect and appoint as many Blacks as he can to high government posts.  The irony, if one takes a good look at the photo above is that many of these &#8216;Blacks&rsquo; are actually much more White than Black, yet they call themselves Black.  Their intellectual capabilities stem from their White ancestry, but most of these people give no credit to their white ancestors; they claim their intellectual gifts for the Black race.  I believe its called genetic theft.  In any case I think we are in for the four most troublesome years in the history of this country with the possible exception of the Civil War years.</p>

Get ready for the aggressive enforcement of the &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; doctrine.  &#8220;Disparate impact&#8221; is when any law or employment or whatever doesn&rsquo;t match the general make-up of society.  So for example if an employer&rsquo;s workforce is 90% white in a city that is 70%, then it is guilty of disparate impact and must take steps to remedy this implicit discrimination.  </p>
<p>see this for details:</p>

			<p>     This is beginning to look more and more like the Clinton presidency, part three. All we need is to have Monica Lewinski appointed Secretary of Wind Energy. Look for the Dems to ruthlessly go after any Republican who so much as sneezed during the last eight years. This is going to be a fishing expedition, bar none. It will cost the taxpayers millions and will generate enough animosity to last for decades.</p>

<p>Well, this really is the kind of &#8220;change&#8221; I expected from Comrade Obama and I even find it believable. However, I do not believe in it, nor will I ever. </p>
<p>Here we have the true measure of this mulatto &#8220;savior&#8221; and multicultural demigod; he is nothing but a political hack and a charlatan. Just look at the names and the resumes; he is not &#8220;changing&#8221; anything, other than replacing (with himself) who is in charge of the old Clinton machine that is the Democratic party. He even has had the gall to attempt to bribe the intended heir apparent, Hillary, with the position of Secretary of State in his &#8220;administration?&#8221; </p>
<p>Some real chutzpa there pal, but I don&rsquo;t think it will work, for two reasons: </p>
<p>First, I think that Red viper Hillary knows that you are going to fail, no matter how much of their ex-pooled &#8220;talent&#8221; you absorb. She knows that the current recession is far deeper than the one her husband inherited; she also knows, that ending the two current wars we are fighting in a snap of the fingers will be no easier for you, than ending Vietnam was for President Nixon. Or in other words, welcome to your consolation prize at LBJ Land Comrade Obama the Tricky Dick Mudslide; we are sorry, we could not get you into the Camelot Fun House. </p>
<p>Second, the Clintons, for all their faults, do think primarily of tactics that will reap the highest rewards and glory for them in the long-term politically. Plus, she still has the taste of your blood in her mouth from the primaries, where she came far closer to beating you than McCain did in the general election. Indeed, if you offer her the job and she does not take it, watch out. Especially watch out, if she shoots to dethrone Harry Reid as the next Senate Majority Leader? </p>
<p>That means, that she is willing to delay her ultimate gratification and take risks while doing so. </p>
<p>What ultimate gratification might that be? </p>
<p>Well, watching you teeter toward the edge of the cliff and then pushing you off it in 2012 of course. </p>
<p>Oh Yes She Can and probably will, Comrade BO! </p>

			<p>I am OK with Erik Holder and David Ogden.</p>
<p>Its Elena Kagan that worries me.  He specialty is administrative law, which   &mdash;   in my opinion   &mdash;   is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Kagan is an Americanised name.  The family name is Kaganovich.  That&rsquo;s Russian.  A quick search on the internet doesn&rsquo;t tell me if she is from the family of Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich, AKA L. M. Kaganovich.  He was known as the Wolf of the Kremlin.  Not that amounts to anything.</p>
<p>A quick search brought up an article on Elena in the Boston newspaper on October 19, 2008, entitled Crimson Tide.  Within it is this sentence: &#8220;Another new hire, Adrian Vermeule, who has argued for radically reducing the role of the Supreme Court, is often grouped with the conservatives&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lets see if she brings Adrian with her&hellip;</p>

			<p>I agree with Poster Gee Vee that this is beginning to look like Clinton Administration, Part III.  </p>
<p>No real &#8216;change&rsquo; is taking place; certainly no positive change. </p>
<p>I hardly expected Obama to fill major slots with Republicans, but this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s appointees are a collection of castoffs and retreads who represent of some of the worst politics possible.</p>
<p>His selections confirm what critics said about him during the election season - He has no substantial experience in public service, private enterprise, or the military. </p>
<p>Such experience would have enabled him to develop contacts with fresh people to fill posts in his administration. </p>
<p>So what does he do? He digs through the recycle bin of the Clinton administrations for his appointees.   </p>

<p>No matter.  &#8220;His selections&#8221; are not likely to be HIS selections.  He is doing what he is TOLD by his handlers and the people who so lavishly financed his campaign.</p>
<p>Obama is the creature of those who discovered him, and &#8220;made&#8221;him.  Those who invented the Obama myth, wrote his books, and groomed him over the past 15 years (eg. David Alxelrod, Bernadine Dohrn, et al), prepping him for this position. Now he&rsquo;s got it and he has debts to pay.  And many thanks  to Harvey for mentioning what I dared not and making a very valid point.<br>

			<p>These individuals are merely public appendages of the Shadow Government that rules from D.C. Just as the Bush administration was peopled with such appendages from as far back as the Nixon administration (Rumsfeld, Cheney, Powell, Armitage, even Paulson), the Obama team must include similar appendages but with Democratic faces this time. Regardless of their public personae, they&rsquo;re all extensions of the Shadow Government. Remember we&rsquo;re subjected to newspeak (<i>change</i> means <i>unchange</i>) and don&rsquo;t fall for the ruse there has been a deviation in those plans set long ago. <br>

			<p>Well, what do you expect whites to do? It&rsquo;s too late now!!! Whites were stupid enough to vote for that &#8220;Obamanation&#8221; in the first place. What did they (whites) expect???? You will see a lot more blacks put into offices they are not qualified for. And you will see reparations become a justifiable topic for realization!<br>
It&rsquo;s also interesting that Obama criticized McCain for finding solutions from the past to solve 21st century problems. He&rsquo;s turning to the solutions of Abraham Lincoln!  Talk about chutzpah!</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;.questions about his role in signing off on the controversial pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>They always save the best for last, as if it&rsquo;s just a &#8216;small issue.&rsquo;  No, March Rich was/is part of huge criminal network that surrounded both the Clinton and Bush administrations, a &#8216;controversial&rsquo; network of &#8216;business associates&rsquo; that also included Jack Abramoff. recently jailed for only a fraction of what he was guilty of.</p>
<p>Rahm Emanuel, a hatchet man for the Clinton administration and a tacit Bush supporter, will make sure that no one, on either side of the aisle, will bring up the name of Marc Rich or Jack Abramoff.  Now that&rsquo;s &#8216;change&rsquo; we can believe in.</p>

<p>I understand what you are saying here.  I am Jewish, and the name Kagan is Jewish  &mdash;  similar names are also Kahane and Cohen.  Many of the Bolsheviks changed their names to sound more &#8216;Russian&rsquo;.  Solzhenitsyn wrote about this in his final work, &#8220;Two Hundred Years Together,&#8221; yet to be translated into English, which is very telling, considering that he was a Nobel Prize winning author.  It&rsquo;s a very accurate and non-judgmental book about a dark part of both Russian and Jewish history as it relates to the Revolution.</p>
<p>Yes, under Kaganovich&rsquo;s orders over 10 million ethnic Ukrainians, who refused collectivization,  were &#8216;cleansed&rsquo; using an artificially imposed famine.  Was that an easier decision for him to make because he was ethnically and ideologically distinct from his victims?  We can only assume, though he claimed to be an atheist.</p>
<p>Obama  walks and talks like a neo-communist, so it shouldn&rsquo;t surprise you that he&rsquo;d have other like-minded apparatchniks around him.  Whether Ms. Kagan is one of them, only time will tell, regardless of her tenuous familial connection to Mr. Kaganovich himself.  You will know them by their deeds, not by their names.</p>

			<p>  On the surface, Elena Kagan doesn&rsquo;t worry me as much as Holder. Kalgan is just a left wing academic liberal, and not a relation, as far as I know, to mass murderer Kaganovich.  Eric Holder is a shifty, corrupt operator, who engineered the Marc Rich pardon for political advantage. Rich was the biggest tax dodger in United States History. His overly made-up, cleavage exhibiting ex-wife was a big contributor to the Clinton Library. She was possibly one of Bill&rsquo;s bimbo eruptions, and actively pressed for the pardon. I remember Bill being unable to keep his hands off her.</p>
