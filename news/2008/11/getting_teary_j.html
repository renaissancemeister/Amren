				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Bolt, Herald Sun (Melbourne), Nov. 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE crowds worshipping at Barack Obama&rsquo;s feet on Tuesday weren&rsquo;t crying tears of joy because the nation had just voted for his tax policy.</p>
<p>The adoration of this US president-elect following his great victory isn&rsquo;t from voters ecstatic that the country&rsquo;s health system may now be reformed. </p>
<p>And ABC Radio yesterday didn&rsquo;t joyously play the American national anthem because its commentators were all weepy to think the US economy would now be re-regulated. </p>
<p>To make what seems an obvious point, these tears, these hugs, this reverential celebration of Obama&rsquo;s win from Washington to Wagga Wagga have been unleashed by Americans voting for their first black president. </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s triumph &mdash; inspiring even to his opponents &mdash; has been instantly hailed as a great healing. The racial divide that so shamefully scarred the country has at last been overcome. </p>
<p>But check the exit polls. That this election showed a nation overcoming its racism is a myth. But what a fine myth it is, which is why it&rsquo;s been adopted not just by the media, but by both sides of US politics. </p>
<p>Obama preached it from the first line of his victory speech: &ldquo;If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.&rdquo; </p>
<p>John McCain was even more explicit in conceding defeat: &ldquo;That (Obama) managed to (win) by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire &hellip; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Age summed up the mood more crudely in this headline: &ldquo;Racial barriers fall as America looks to its great black hope.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But did those barriers really fall? Was this result really a vote for America&rsquo;s black hope, offering healing? Or did voters simply back Obama, if reluctantly, for the usual pragmatic reasons that make voters choose one side over the stale other? </p>
<p>I know. It seems even sacrilege to raise these questions, so powerful is the myth already of Obama the Healer. </p>
<p>But check the exit polls of Tuesday&rsquo;s vote. They suggest &mdash; superficially, at least &mdash; that Obama didn&rsquo;t quite overcome racial divides, and may even have entrenched them. </p>
<p>Some 95 per cent of black voters backed the black guy against McCain, the white Republican. In the Democratic primaries it had been much the same, with as many as 90 per cent backing Obama against Hillary Clinton, the white Democrat. (If you&rsquo;re looking for a racist vote, start here.) </p>
<p>Two-thirds of Latino and Asian voters chose Obama, too, but most whites stuck with McCain, 56 per cent giving the white guy their vote. </p>
<p>In fact, you could even blame that reluctance of whites to back Obama for making his win rather modest. </p>
<p>Consider: Obama had twice the cash of McCain, most of the celebrity endorsements, and coverage from the media that was rarely short of fawning. </p>
<p>He was also running against a very old and crippled man who came from the same party as George Bush, one of the most unpopular presidents in history, and had chosen as a running mate a woman the media damned as a moron and burned as a witch. </p>
<p>Everything went Obama&rsquo;s way. Voters were already angry about the economy, the war in Iraq and the price of petrol, and tended to blame the lot on Bush. Then to stink up the Republican brand completely, just weeks from voting day, Wall St fell in a hole so deep that we&rsquo;re still waiting for the splash. </p>
<p>Given all that, and his near unanimous support from black voters, it&rsquo;s amazing Obama won by just 52.3 per cent to McCain&rsquo;s 46.4. What stopped him from winning huge? His race? </p>
<p>But even this picture, of the races lining up behind the men who most looked like them, is exaggerated and masks the real problem, which isn&rsquo;t really racism but culture. </p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much evidence, in fact, that Obama shifted many votes because of his race, one way or the other. (His wins in the Democratic primaries are excepted.) </p>
<p>Yes, 95 per cent of blacks voted for him, but that&rsquo;s only a bit up on the usual black vote for a Democrat candidate, (even if the turnout this year may have been greater). John Kerry got 88 per cent in 2004, and Al Gore in 2000 got 90 per cent. </p>
<p>Latinos likewise usually vote two to one for Democrats, and only gave Bush a higher vote in 2004 because he spoke Spanish and had worked hard for many years to win their trust. </p>
<p>But with Republicans since cracking down on Latino illegal immigrants, Latino voters were always likely to get behind the Democrats again. </p>
<p>As for the whites, no Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 has ever won a majority of their votes. </p>
<p>Obama this time did win over as many white voters as any of the past three Democrats, including Bill Clinton, and did better with poor whites, hurt by tough times, than did Kerry four years ago. </p>
<p>And now the pattern of this election &mdash; and the myth of Obama the Healer &mdash; becomes clearer. </p>
<p>All racial groups swung towards Obama (the whites less so), but not so wildly as you&rsquo;d expect with all that was going for him, despite his inexperience and past associations with extremists. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the issue most in their minds was not race. Two-thirds of voters told exit polls the economy was their biggest issue &mdash; the strongest such result in two decades &mdash; and seven in 10 said the country was going in the wrong direction. </p>
<p>Change is what Obama promised, and change is what they wanted. But a change in race politics? Obama never campaigned on that. </p>
<p>True, looking black, he didn&rsquo;t need to say more, and for some the mere fact of a black man running for candidate must have been exciting. Obama indeed got a swing from young white voters, so often fresh-faced idealists. </p>
<p>But the change he symbolises in race politics may not be the change traditional black activists and race industry workers seek at all. </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s life story is of a man actually beyond race &mdash; more beyond it, indeed, than are many who now cheer his win so frantically. </p>
<p>He may be black, but he was just two when his Kenyan father shot through, and was brought up by his white mother and white grandparents, mostly in Indonesia and Hawaii, far from African-American suburbs. </p>
<p>He later tried to find a black identity, going for two decades to a militantly black Chicago church, but he would know well what a fraud it is to divide each other by race, and to negotiate as if we belonged to separate tribes. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes him such a relief to many whites, who&rsquo;d rather feel good than guilty, and are so grateful to a black man who doesn&rsquo;t scold them. </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s also what makes him a challenge to many African-Americans, many of whom have grown up in a culture of victimhood and entitlement, and too often see government as the solution to problems no government on its own could ever fix. </p>
<p>Three statistics alone will show that what really divides the US is not racism but culture: 50 per cent of black children drop out; almost 70 per cent don&rsquo;t have dad at home; and blacks commit half America&rsquo;s murders. </p>
<p>The trouble is it&rsquo;s easier to demand help than to find your own feet, and it&rsquo;s not for nothing that blacks so overwhelmingly vote Democrat, which has long played to identity politics, handout dependency and the dead-end culture of grievance. </p>
<p>But what has given Obama his astonishing success is none of that old-style race politics. He&rsquo;s not into grievance but sweat. He has succeeded by studying hard, working hard, thinking hard &mdash; values he took from his Midwestern mother. </p>
<p>And in his victory speech he quoted most a Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, also from Illinois, and praised his &ldquo;values of self-reliance, individual liberty&rdquo;. He called not for great new government programs, but &ldquo;a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder&rdquo;. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right, of course. The racial divide in America was not healed by a simple vote last Tuesday, even had that been what the voters intended. </p>
<p>That divide will stay until there is above all a cultural change within African-American society &mdash; a change that will have kids growing up with dutiful fathers at home. That will have them finishing school and getting the learning, confidence and sense of responsibility that will help them to make a career. A life. </p>
<p>What must change is culture, and there Obama&rsquo;s work has yet to begin. All he has done is offer the shining example that anything is possible in America. A black man may be president, because the system does work, and if a man fails we might look closer to home for the reasons. </p>
<p>But praise the myth. Admire Obama. We need heroes, so hold him up as the inspiration to at last look beyond race to character. </p>
<p>Yet, do not forget the system worked already, and Obama merely proved it. It is America, as much as Obama, that deserves this great praise. <br>

<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why he titled his first book &#8220;Dreams from My Fathers - A Story of RACE AND INHERITANCE&#8221;.</p>
<p>This article is silly exactly because it tries to be objective and fails miserably.  Still, I guess we should congratulate him for trying. <br>

<p>That so many of these media types really believe such nonsense is just absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>Nothing is going to change with blacks.  They&rsquo;ll still fail and they&rsquo;ll still blame it on whitey, and they&rsquo;ll still riot from time to time if they perceive some advantage in doing so.</p>
<p>In four years blacks still will need AA to get into colleges and into corporate positions they&rsquo;re not qualified for, and they&rsquo;ll still scream racism when they need an excuse to cover up their stupidity. </p>
<p>GOd, I&rsquo;m thankful I&rsquo;m not the moronic icky sticky types who want to hug, hold hands and cry because I&rsquo;m overcome with do-gooderism or I&rsquo;m too gullible to know blacks just don&rsquo;t feel the same way.</p>
<p>What a bunch of total idiots.</p>

			<p>I think this article is an eerie parallel to Jared Taylor, in &#8220;Why Obama Will Win,&#8221; several months ago.  It simply boiled down to: (1) Whites in OH and PA far away from blacks and troubled by the economy, and (2) A percentage of whites, lib and otherwise, who just wanted to feel good.</p>

			<p>Not a bad article, coming from the MSM, but what evidence does he have that the three statistics he cites are the result of culture?  None whatsoever and, on the contrary, all the evidence points to genetics as the primary cause.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s 57 million of us who did not &#8220;feel the love&#8221; of the Dear Leader Obama.  Take the black&rsquo;s, illegal&rsquo;s, homeless, ecstasy-addled college kids and the scores of dead people, imaginary people and the folks who voted early and often out of the mix and it might have been a different scenario.  That&rsquo;s 57 million citizens who don&rsquo;t believe in socialism or rewarding sloth and stupidity.  57 million bitter clingers hanging on to our God and our guns.  The Dear Leader should stop and ponder those numbers before he enacts the next chapter of his Saul Alinsky playbook on the country. </p>

			<p>This guy makes an excellent point. Most Whites who voted for Obama did so because of the economy. He carried a little more White support than past Democratic Candidates, but only by a few points. Excluding the extreme White Liberals who are a very small minority, White Voters who chose Obama did so for one of two reasons. The majority of Whites who voted for Obama did it because of the economy. They simply said that four more years of the same economic policy would be a disaster. This group said that there had to be a change, even if it wasn&rsquo;t the best change possible. The second group of Whites who voted for Obama were young voters. This group voted for for the same reason that the first group did, but they had another strong motive. They wanted to be part of the Obama movement. Every main stream media outlet in the country rammed the idea of &#8220;It&rsquo;s Cool to Vote for Obama&#8221; down our throats. Obama&rsquo;s campaign was designed to look like a transformational national movement. Young Whites heard Obama&rsquo;s promises of unity, prosperity, and healing the racial divide, and decided they wanted in. Most people under the age of 35-40 don&rsquo;t remember racism, but they live in the shadow of it. We&rsquo;ve been told that at one time it existed, but that we&rsquo;re overcoming it. We&rsquo;ve had to live under this blanket of guilt that our race was somehow responsible for all of the Black Races&rsquo; shortcomings, without ever personally witnessing it. Most young Whites have nothing against Blacks, and they want everyone to get along and be equal. Obama promised that. Most young people joined Obama&rsquo;s movement as a renunciation of perceived past injustices. When Blacks continue to play the race card after this, most young Whites will start to see things clearly. I think they&rsquo;ll look back and see Obama&rsquo;s Campaign as less of a universal national movement, but instead as a concerted Black effort to advance their own racial agenda. If you don&rsquo;t believe that this type of change in outlook can occur, look at the Bush supports of yester-years. Bush liked to portray himself as a &#8220;Compassionate Conservative&#8221;. He said that he was a &#8220;uniter, not a divider&#8221;. He promised to clean up Washington, and bring integrity back to the White House. Americans bought into this fairy tail, and now most of them see it for what it was. A SHAM!!! People who once hailed Bush as the second coming now hate him with a passion. White supporters of Obama will end up the same way. This is a generation changing event. As I said before, young Whites don&rsquo;t remember the days of racial segregation. They look back on it as terrible chapter in American History, and they want unity and equality, but they don&rsquo;t have the same guilt that past generations do. Young Whites never did anything to Blacks, and young Blacks never had anything done to them. When Blacks screw over the new generation of Whites, they&rsquo;re not going to take it the same way older Whites do. They&rsquo;re going to revolt.</p>

			<p>The REASONS Americans chose Obama can be listed thusly:</p>
<p>Young 1st and 2nd time voters, hopelessly brainwashed after being so indoctrinated with the p.c. slop thrugh their school years   &mdash;   to the point they&rsquo;ve lost their evaluating and reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>Voters so disenchanted with eight years of Dubya, a man in a three-way tie with Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton for the title: THE ABSOLUTE WORST PRESIDENT AMERICA EVER HAD&hellip; That these voters would have voted for Satan himself, if he were in the race.</p>
<p>voters so befuddled by six or seven years of media hype and hoopla about Obama, The Magniricent&hellip; that they could not comprehend anything but what they were told by the media to believe.</p>
<p>voters so dumbed down and numbed down by the media circus that started with the primaries that they just didn&rsquo;t care WHO won. As long as it wasn&rsquo;t McCain</p>

			<p>Probably the most chilling aspect of this article is this sentence:</p>
<p>&#8220;Two-thirds of Latino and Asian voters chose Obama, too, but most whites stuck with McCain, 56 percent giving the white guy their vote.&#8221; </p>
<p>A white majority of voters (only slightly smaller than Curious George&rsquo;s 2004 total of 58% and higher then his 2000 total of 54%) went for Senator McCain and he still lost. It will be interesting to see what the regional totals were, but I suspect that it was only regional differences that gave McCain his edge in the white vote, primarily the South. A second point being that whites now only make up about 75% of registered voters, or at least voters who actually voted in this election (see AR News article, Vote By Race and Sex at this link below.)</p>
<p><a href="/news/2008/11/vote_by_race_an.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2008/11/vote_by_race_an.php</a></p>
<p>I was under the impression that while we only make up about 65% of the total population, we were still 80% or more of total registered voters? Did whites sit this one out and thus decrease our total percentage of actual voters, or have we shrunk that dramatically in the total of current registered voters? It will be very interesting to see what the critical states of : Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Florida did and what percentage of whites went for Comrade BO in them. </p>
<p>Let us hope, that each of these states with a majority of whites in the population between as low as about 75% to as high as about 88% saw a shift in white voters toward Comrade BO or simply not voting in disgust? If this is the case, then things are not so bad. This was a horrid year all around for Republicans both politically and &#8220;circumstantially,&#8221; and they are not going to improve for the Democrats in these spheres simply because the Republicans have been totally swept from power now. If anything, since they now control the whole chess board, it may hit them on every game piece they have in 2010 and 2012? This might be particularly true, if the Republicans can learn from their multicultural mistakes, and &#8220;get real&#8221; about the issue of not just &#8220;culture&#8221; but also race&rsquo;s impact on it?</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p>

			<p>The fact is that Ron Paul had the biggest international following of all of the candidates until he dropped out of the race. There were only a handful of countries where Paul didn&rsquo;t reign as the preferred candidate.  The war and the economy  were Paul&rsquo;s trademarks and strengths. Obama even used Pauls internet fund-raising tacticts to further his own campaign when Paul was hung out to dry by the GOP. In some ways, Paul may have been a spoiler. Having been burned by the GOP with their selection of McCain and mistreatment of Paul, I doubt too many of Pauls supporters voted for McCain and may have voted Democrat either out of malice for the GOP or for their own anti-war stance which Obama falsely advocates. And Paul did advocate a complete change, a message which gained momentum during the campaign and became the single most important ideal in Obama&rsquo;s quest for office.  </p>

<p>In a related story, Steve Sailer has this map that shows county-by-county, not in terms of who won the county, but in terms of the change from four years ago, the red in this case being change from D to R:</p>

<p>The New York Times had the same map, but it also showed shades of blue in degrees of a county changing from R to D, how much it did.</p>
<p>Note McCain&rsquo;s pickup in Appalachia and the mid-South, in AR.  Parts of OK, and southern Louisiana   &mdash;   that I think is because of the black exodus post-Katrina, and their not returning.  Of course, most AZ counties are colored in this map, too.</p>

			<p> &#8221; And in his victory speech he quoted most a Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, also from Illinois, and praised his &ldquo;values of self-reliance, individual liberty&rdquo;.   &#8220;<br>
-Abraham Lincoln did not get a law degree though affirmative action.  And he was actually from Illinois.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Obama had twice the cash of McCain,&#8221;   Twice?  McCain ran on about 85 million dollars; Obama, more than 600 million (some of it from Hamas, some from stolen credit cards&hellip;) .  I suppose that&rsquo;s about &#8220;twice&#8221;.  Sure.  </p>

<p>The author&rsquo;s exhortation to  &#8220;hold him (Obama) up as the inspiration to at last look beyond race to character.&#8221;, if heard,  will not result in what he hopes for.  <br>
Obama&rsquo;s character did not get him elected.  What we have seen of his character should have gotten him rejected.  </p>
<p>The only thing this author gets right is that many people voted for Obama (some of them more than once, no doubt) for no other reason than his race.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;I think this article is an eerie parallel to Jared Taylor, in &ldquo;Why Obama Will Win,&rdquo; several months ago. It simply boiled down to: (1) Whites in OH and PA far away from blacks and troubled by the economy, and (2) A percentage of whites, lib and otherwise, who just wanted to feel good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong!  My female in-laws in Ohio couldn&rsquo;t wait to vote this guy in.  Ex-Brooklynites, one who once said to me that she couldn&rsquo;t eat with &#8220;them&#8221; without getting sick and the other too stupid to know if her underwear is even on (she&rsquo;s too busy looking in the mirror).   I heard &#8220;but they had to sit in the back of the bus!&#8221;  Yeah, well I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t want to sit with them on the E train to Manhattan, honey!  Real barf material.  Not what they said but they themselves.  Maybe the daughter will bring home a nice dark one from Cincinnati so that her and mommy can &#8220;share&#8221; him.  That will get rid of the guilt in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>Ron Pauls international (read European) following was found among internet users and intellectuals. Mainstream European media was 100% Obama, which is not surprising considering the large amount of communists and liberals in the journalistic profession. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Young Whites never did anything to Blacks, and young Blacks never had anything done to them. When Blacks screw over the new generation of Whites, they&rsquo;re not going to take it the same way older Whites do. They&rsquo;re going to revolt.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the media is for. And why we can never, ever, be told the truth. Even if noone believes the lies anymore, they&rsquo;ll keep coming. It&rsquo;s enough just to create some doubt. The truth is liable to set one free. <br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a Paul supporter who couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to vote for either of the Demoplicans.  McCain offered us 4 more years of Jorge Bush.  Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;change&#8221; just means more of the same old   &mdash;   more illegal immigration, more affirmative action, more deficits, more taxes, more big government.  He may eventually get us out of Iraq, but he won&rsquo;t bring the troops home from Germany, Japan, Korea, South America, and everyplace else.  People say you should vote for the lesser of two evils, but not only is that still voting for evil, in this case I couldn&rsquo;t even decide who was the lesser.  Certainly McCain&rsquo;s pasty white skin wasn&rsquo;t going to get him my vote when his policies are so much against my interests.</p>

			<p>I had mentioned yesterday about overhearing farmers who had voted early here in Texas, but not voting for any candidate for President.</p>
<p>I went down to the courthouse today and reviewed the election returns.  The total undercount was 2.21% of the vote.  Thats the number that voted down ballot but didn&rsquo;t vote up ballot, ie for President/Vice-President.  This 2.21% didn&rsquo;t like either major party ticket.  Just how many votes that equals nationally I don&rsquo;t know.  Someone else will have to do the math.  I don&rsquo;t have the numbers in front of me right now, the national vote totals for McCain and Obama.  I understand that Obama beat McCain 2 to 1 in the popular vote.  So I doubt picking up this 2.21% would  have made a difference for McCain.</p>
<p>If the Republicans had fielded a President candidate that was qualified, would they have picked up this 2.21% plus a good percentage of those who just stayed home and didn&rsquo;t vote?  Don&rsquo;t know&hellip;</p>
<p>Given the eight years of Bush and the McCain Miracle at the polls,  I don&rsquo;t think there was anything the GOP could have done this election year to win it.</p>

And also the ties he has to white neo-Bolsheviks who follow the Saul Alinsky playbook.  It&rsquo;s really scary how much we don&rsquo;t know about Obama and yet the drunken world celebrates his victory.</p>

<p>I just had one of the most enlightening (not in a good way) experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had.  I post on another forum for people interested in precious metals.  In the last few weeks there have been some new posters who are &#8220;Obamamaniacs.&#8221;  </p>
<p>At first I humored them, pointed to facts, tried to educate, chide them, awaken them to the truth.  What a fool&rsquo;s errand that was</p>
<p>These posters I&rsquo;ve been attempting to debate with  are rude, implacable, unreasonable, irrational, name callers with nothing to base it on, repeat the same chants over and over and over, accuse others with no evidence, assume the worst, refuse to consider an opinion, ignore anything they don&rsquo;t want to hear, bald faced liars&hellip;.  I can only call them &#8220;Obamabot&#8221;s.</p>
<p>Are they human or a computer progam?  If they are real humans who are this dogmatic, irrational, swept up in a bizarre form of religious ecstasy, then, guys, I&rsquo;m not confident there is a way back out of the hell coming with the Obama Marxist regime.</p>

			<p>Bolt says a lot of good things in this column, but he is more of a right-liberal than a genuine conservative. Note his claim that Obama,</p>
<p><i>&#8220;later tried to find a black identity, going for two decades to a militantly black Chicago church, but he would know well what a fraud it is to divide each other by race, and to negotiate as if we belonged to separate tribes.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Bolt in his columns is strongly against people having distinct ethnic identities. Unlike left-liberals he is consistent in this view: he believes that it is not just whites who should give up an ethnic identity in favour of a common human one, but everybody.</p>
<p>So for instance he has <a href="https://ozconservative.blogspot.com/2007/10/why-does-left-treat-us-differently.html" rel="nofollow">criticised</a> a group of Australian Aborigines who wanted to preserve an historic artefact on the grounds that, by acting as a tribe, they were flouting,</p>
<p>&#8220;The humanist idea that we are all individuals, free to make our own identities as equal members of the human race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bolt believes, in other words, in the liberal idea that we must be autonomous, self-creating individuals and that we must therefore reject any unchosen, ethnic forms of identity.</p>
<p>Similarly Bolt has written that he doesn&rsquo;t like there being a category of Aboriginal art at the National Gallery of Victoria because such categories &#8220;drive us back into our racial prisons&#8221;.</p>
<p>Bolt is someone who is of service in criticising the left, but he remains an unsympathetic liberal overall.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, 95 per cent of blacks voted for him, but that&rsquo;s only a bit up on the usual black vote for a Democrat candidate, (even if the turnout this year may have been greater). John Kerry got 88 per cent in 2004, and Al Gore in 2000 got 90 per cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, 5% of blacks voted against Obama, and 12% of Blacks voted against Kerry.</p>
<p>That means that 58% of the blacks who voted against Kerry voted for Obama.</p>

			<p>&#8220;That divide will stay until there is above all a cultural change within African-American society &mdash; a change that will have kids growing up with dutiful fathers at home. That will have them finishing school and getting the learning, confidence and sense of responsibility that will help them to make a career.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the ultimate White Universalist Dream&hellip;that blacks will one day see that the Western socio-political model of delayed gratification, work, study, and the nuclear family is the best recipe for peace, security and success.</p>
<p>The problem is, there is no hint of this on the horizon. Hopefully one day whites will admit to themselves that blacks act the way they do, not because they are undereducated or disenfranchised from the American mainstream, but because it is the way they want to act. </p>
<p>Until then we must suffer through idiot who call for more political outreach (Republicans) and social programs (Democrats).</p>
<p>Blacks are celebrating (here and in Africa) because they think that their lives are about to improve immeasurably. It will be interesting to see, in a couple of years, how they act when they realize that their American cargo cult fantasies are worthless.</p>

			<p>The Marxist use of mass crowd manipulation and deceitful propaganda was in place when a young George Soros was betraying Jews in Hungary to the Nazi authorities during World War II. It has been refined over the years, but its origins date back to the Weimar Germany&rsquo;s Frankfurt School, whose leading lights, such as Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, and Hannah Arendt, emigrated to the United States in the 1930s. </p>
<p>Also influential were the teachings of Antonio Gramsci, a 1920s Italian Communist who advocated gradual infiltration of a society&rsquo;s institutions with the goal of ultimate takeover, as opposed to the brute force methods favored by Stalin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that it is a conspiracy or the clandestine workings of a secret society in the commonly understood sense.</p>
<p>Rather, it is people whose open goal is entire transformation of society and the utter destruction of the traditional order to create a post-modern paradise. Recall the lyrics of John Lennon&rsquo;s song, Imagine, and you may understand their vision. Whether motivated by hatred, as Karl Marx was, or seduced by a delusion, as your typical Obama acolyte is, the end is the same: the death of America and the West. </p>

			<p>I was not surprised that Obama quoted Lincoln.  A lot of people, for some reason like to quote Lincoln.  The only things written about Lincoln are that he freed the slaves and saved the Union.  I don&rsquo;t believe he did either.  I do believe he allowed his generals to use murderious tactics against American citizens for the sake of holding on to southern revenue.  The slave issue is bogus since it didn&rsquo;t become an issue until 2 years after the war had started.  We all know that.  </p>
<p>But even though the slaves were eventually emanicipated, what has not been taught, is that Lincoln did not believe that black and white could live together in the same country.  Nor did he believe that someone like Obama should EVER hold a public office or even sit on a jury.  Those little facts have tended to get sweep beneath history&rsquo;s carpet.  The only difference between Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln is that Jefferson actually slaves and Lincoln didn&rsquo;t.  If Lincoln and his family had been slave holders, you wouldn&rsquo;t find blacks or whites quoting him.</p>
<p>One correction to the poster above.  Although Lincoln lived most of his life in Illinois, he was not originally from there.  He was born in Kentucy and his family moved to Illinois early in his life.  He was not a native of Illinois.</p>

<p>Virtually EVERYTHING Jared said would come to pass, DID INDEED come to pass, from the fawning by the media over their &#8220;Messiah&#8221;, to white college students voting for him under some delusion of trying to &#8220;buy racial peace&#8221;.</p>

<p>Obama and a string of superlatives - the most black, the most left-wing and the most inexperienced President ever, with the most fawning media support conceivable, He and his Democratic herd will create a catastrophe beyond repair.</p>

I&rsquo;m uncertain about that. Ir remains to be seen. He, as the first black pres, could do a fairly good job, being carefully guided by his handlers. They will want to see to that, in order to create a good impression and leave a good legacy. </p>
<p>An Obama presidency could well be like the first black family moving into a white community to begin the process of breaking it up.   They are likely to be very nice, respectable, quiet people.  But they are just the door openers.  What you have to worry about, once they have their foot in the door, is those who will follow.</p>

			<p>The article is Marxist Liberal tripe masquerading as journalism.</p>
<p>I agree with the person who stated Obama&rsquo;s past history of association with black racists and related extremists (along, with, might I add, his so-called autobiography influenced, it is strongly believed, by a couple of known black racists, one of whom was a leader of the Nation of Islam), should have lost him a much greater potential of the white vote than actually was the case.</p>
<p>A combination of a number of factors such as fear of a threatened severe economic downturn, risk of repossession due to mass redundancies, the dufunked justification for the current Middle East &#8216;wars&rsquo;, the military death toll and cost to American taxpayers most certainly have played a part in candidate choice, but the fact that blacks are celebrating this win in racial terms, is concrete proof they voted for Obama based <b>primarily</b> on the racial consideration.   As soon as a candidate that &#8216;looked like them&rsquo; entered the frame, 97% of their votes went to him.  Hilary, was still running well into the race yet blacks deserted her in droves.  That&rsquo;s a definite sign of anti-white racism at work.</p>
<p>As for the whites that voted for him, in my view, this is purely due to the usual Marxist indoctrination scam consisting of their same old guilt-tripping and self-loathing methodology which happened to swing it for the black camp on this occasion.</p>
<p>I also firmly believe, again anticipated by another poster on here, that future white generations are not going to be enslaved by Cultural Marxism and its blatant anti-white racist manifestations, in times ahead. </p>

			<p>The Andrew Bolt article is not without interest but it is vitiated by a facile assumption about the primacy of culture   &mdash;   an assumption which I thought had been long discredited.  Culture does not originate out of nowhere; it derives from the ethnic stock that created it.  It is, of course, true  that the individual from birth finds himself in a specific cultural milieu which he had no part in creating, but his native aptitude for internalizing that culture is a factor in determining to what degree he becomes acculturated – in other words, nature/nurture is a false disjunction.   The changes to black &ldquo;culture&rdquo; that Bolt says are needed are   &mdash;   as far as I can tell    &mdash;   pathologies afflicting black life everywhere.   It is therefore likely that they have their foundation in nature not culture.  To express it more accurately,  the adaptive pressures molding Africans during their evolution resulted in behavioral traits that do not fit comfortably with the civilization of Europeans, a group that was subjected to a different set of adaptive pressures.<br>
&ldquo;What must change is culture,&rdquo; says Mr. Bolt.  But the chances for a dramatic makeover in black behavior are slight regardless of the cultural milieu in which they are immersed.<br>
