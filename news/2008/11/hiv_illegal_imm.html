				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), November 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An illegal immigrant may have infected hundreds of women with HIV in a string of one-night-stands, it has emerged.</p>
<p>The infected Jamaican reveller prowled nightclubs to pick up women and then spent almost a year unchecked in hospital where he looked for sex with vulnerable patients.</p>
<p>Health officials have written to more than 400 women to warn them they might have the deadly virus after having unprotected sex with him.</p>
<p>The immigrant, who arrived in the UK on a visitor&rsquo;s visa in 2002, has admitted he cannot remember how many woman he has slept with.</p>
<p>He told doctors he had sex, which was often unprotected, with women he met in two nightclubs in Leicester &mdash; the now-defunct Dark Club and the Burlington Club.</p>
<p>Last December, he was admitted to the Brandon mental health unit at Leicester General Hospital where he slept with fellow patients &mdash; possibly even in the unit.</p>
<p>Doctors were told in May that his visa had expired and he was living in the UK illegally but the HIV danger only became known in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>A married patient confessed to sleeping with him, according to the Sun, and he then told medics about his other sexual liaisons.</p>
<p>A source told the paper: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s literally panic stations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr Philip Monk, a consultant for the Health Protection Agency (HPA) East Midlands, said: &lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know (the number of women he had unprotected sex with). He was going clubbing very regularly. He didn&rsquo;t have a sexual encounter every time he went out, but it didn&rsquo;t happen infrequently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a possibility it could be more than 100. We believe it was more than a handful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &lsquo;We are concerned that there is a risk that the HIV positive individual may have passed on the infection as a result of the sexual activity he has engaged in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Understandably, women who have had sexual experiences with someone they met at either of these venues are likely to be extremely concerned, but it&rsquo;s important that they either visit their local genito-urinary medicine clinic or family planning clinic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is also treatment that can enable them to live near-normal healthy and full lives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The HPA confirmed the man, who moved to Leicester in 2002, was not a bouncer at either of the clubs.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust, which runs the Brandon unit, said all the women he slept with from there had been contacted.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;Although a person may have mental health problems, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they cannot take clear decisions on other aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no suggestion any activity was other than consensual but we are mindful of the potential vulnerability of these women and have taken every step to follow up the letters through teams providing medical help and emotional support.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man is now being cared for by the NHS outside of Leicestershire.</p>
<p>If caught early enough, medical treatment can prevent the HIV virus from developing in to full-blown AIDS, offering patients the chance of a largely-normal life.</p>
<p>HIV infects the white blood cells, which normally protect people from disease. AIDS develops when the immune system becomes too weak to continue fighting the infection.</p>
<p>Patients with HIV typically begin to show symptoms of the infection within five to ten years in around half of all cases.</p>
<p>Initial symptoms are often general conditions such as tiredness, or general ill health, but in advanced cases, patients may display &lsquo;AIDS defining&rsquo; symptoms such as skin tumours or even AIDS-related dementia.</p>
<p>Two years ago, more than a thousand patients were placed on alert after a hospital worker was diagnosed with HIV and hepatitis B.</p>
<p>In the first incident of its kind, the unnamed employee was diagnosed with both blood-borne viruses while working in the NHS.</p>
<p>1,185 patients who had been treated by the worker at five hospitals across the West Midlands and Hampshire faced blood tests to see if they had contracted either disease.</p>
<p>* Anyone concerned can contact NHS Direct on 0845 603 0897 where staff have been briefed on the case.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see why anyone is upset.  After all, that Jamaican illegal alien represented that diversity that England&rsquo;s &#8220;better minds&#8221; keep saying that is so important, and is the best virtue.  That 400 women got HIV because of his promiscuity is just one of those broken eggs that one encounters on occasion while trying to make the omelet of equality.</p>

<p>Why?  Why isn&rsquo;t he deported to Jamaica where can be cared for by whatever health service they have?</p>

<p>This guy beggars belief.  This is the problem with illegal immigration. You wouldn&rsquo;t let total strangers off of the street free entry into your home would you???? That would be insane. It&rsquo;s just as insane to let people into your country that you know nothing about. I guess political correctness trumps people&rsquo;s lives. We are living in insane times.</p>

			<p>I wonder what the dollar cost of this illegal immigrants &#8216;work&rsquo; is going to cost, it would have to be in the millions of pounds.<br>
And a solider in the middle of War would surely have less confirmed kills, than what this guy will end up with.<br>

&#8220;A married patient confessed to sleeping with him&#8221;&hellip;<br>
 Sympathy for whoever was dumb enough to marry this woman. Reminds me of the black women who contract HIV from their black male partners being on the &#8216;down low&rsquo;.<br>
Till death do us part.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
You can&rsquo;t really blame him though, it would be like getting irritated because water is wet.<br>

			<p>Why would Britain give a visitor visa to a person from a country which is &#8216;high risk&rsquo; for illegally over-staying and criminal activity?</p>
<p>The issuance of a British visa to young, unmarried Jamaicans should be rare, because they are an extreme risk of abusing the privilege.  </p>

			<p>The Romans were well aware of these problems:</p>
<p>&#8220;The pure home is not mongrelized by illicit sexual intercourse.  Law and custom have driven out forbidden mongrelization.  Mothers are praised for the resemblance of their offspring.  Vengeance closely follows guilt.&#8221;</p>

			<p>If you really want an example of the state of play in modern Britain, I could offer you better.(this report comes in the same week as a most shocking child murder case - committed by White Britons, of the lowest class, in which government agencies displayed the worst incompetence humanly possible).<br>
  Anyhow, as I&rsquo;ve said before such &#8216;Darwin award cases&rsquo; (as I term them) crop fairly regularly (some should do a proper statstical analysis as to their &#8216;normally distributed frequency&rsquo;).Always the same, White trollops and the virile black stud.</p>

<p>My partner cried when she saw the photo released yesterday of the little victim in the case you mentioned.<br>
He looks strikingly like my one year old son.<br>
Poor little soul.<br>

			<p>      Because of his HIV+ status, he is assured of asylum in<br>
Britain. Once he is feeling better, he will be released and<br>
continue infecting women. The answer? Common Law justice a la<br>
the Old South or the Old West.</p>

<p>It would be interesting if most or all of them have contracted AIDS. Nature has a way of branding undesirables.</p>
<p>BTW, I wonder how many illegitimates he sired.</p>

<p>Yes of course, bring him back to Jamaica where he can more easily get into the U.S.</p>

			<p>The Usual Suspects probably expect us to collectively believe this is a tragedy, necessitating funding for &#8220;understanding&#8221; and &#8220;tolerance&#8221;.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it&rsquo;s hilarious.  The departure of a sizeable fraction of these 400 left-wing women will be a good thing for Britain.</p>
