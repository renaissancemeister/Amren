<h1><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/02/AR2008110202448_pf.html">Diversity Blooms in Outer Suburbs</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Miroff, Washington Post, Nov. 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Prince William County has become the most ethnically and racially diverse county in Northern Virginia as a profound demographic shift in the region is reversing half a century of white-flight suburbanization, according to a report by the Northern Virginia Regional Commission.</p>
<p>Much of the realignment is a result of tremendous population growth in the outer suburbs, the report shows, drawing on recent estimates from the Census Bureau&lsquo;s American Community Survey. Of the 270,000 people who moved to Northern Virginia between 2000 and 2007, 75 percent settled in Loudoun County, Prince William County, Manassas or Manassas Park.</p>
<p>In Prince William, the growth was driven almost entirely by minorities, who accounted for 94 percent of the population increase.</p>
<p>In contrast, the inner suburbs of Arlington County and Alexandria, once considered gateway communities for immigrants, have lost minority residents since 2000, becoming more white and more affluent.</p>
<p>The report illustrates trends that have been observed in school data and anecdotally but that when distilled into simple charts and tables reflect a demographic makeover that might upend widespread perceptions about the region and its communities.</p>
<p>The changes have been especially dramatic in Prince William. Since 1990, the county&rsquo;s minority population has risen from 19.3 percent of the total population to 47.9 percent, and the jurisdiction is on pace to soon become Northern Virginia&rsquo;s first minority-majority county. Only Manassas Park has a higher minority population &mdash; 50 percent &mdash; among Northern Virginia jurisdictions. Manassas is third at 46.3 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall, Northern Virginia is 40.4 percent minority, up from 23.2 percent in 1990; the nation as a whole is 33.9 percent minority. The region&rsquo;s African American and Hispanic populations account for slightly less than their national percentages, but the region&rsquo;s Asian population is 12.1 percent, nearly three times the national figure of 4.4 percent.</p>
<p>Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairman Gerald E. Connolly (D), who commissioned the regional report, described the changes it outlines as stunning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty years ago, Northern Virginia was just a totally different place,&rdquo; said Connolly, the commission&rsquo;s chairman, who would represent part of Prince William if he won the 11th Congressional District seat in tomorrow&rsquo;s election. &ldquo;The numbers tell us a lot about our own communities, and the implications are profound in terms of the provision of services.&rdquo;</p>

Again, whites have set up a community that is highly desirable.</p>
<p>Instead of studying and replicating white success in their own communities, minorities find it easier to take what they can not create from themselves.</p>
<p>Repeat until all is destroyed.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in Virginia all of my life.  It&rsquo;s true, N. VA is going 3rd world&hellip; thats why I stay in central VA, but it&rsquo;s becoming the same way here&hellip;  The Shenandoah Valley will always be a majority white populated though, they can&rsquo;t take the Blue Ridge from us, though all of the turkey processing plants have brought in droves of illegals&hellip; </p>

			<p>I love diversity. Nothing makes me happier than seeing Prices Skyrocket when blacks start to move in. And the drop in crime seems unbelivable. Schools and business love a heavy influx of blacks they are so honest and forward thinking.</p>

			<p>The articles  title says, &#8220;Diversity &#8220;BLOOMS&#8221; in Outer Suburbs&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are a few words and phrases from the article that are so typical of the way these stories are written, with my personal reactions:</p>
<p>&#8220;Whiteflight&#8221;  &mdash;  people trying to be safe from crime</p>
<p>&#8220;Changes have been dramatic&#8221;  &mdash;  I like change that isn&rsquo;t dramatic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was a totally different place&#8221;  &mdash;  really, was it better, worse? </p>
<p>&#8220;tremendous population growth&#8221;  &mdash;  might have been peacefull once.</p>
<p>&#8220;becoming more white and more affluent&#8221;  &mdash;  what a shame/sin.</p>

			<p>How much longer will Republicans be able to hold onto Texas?  This is probably the last election cycle for them.  Colorado has already changed and Arizona and North Carolina are finished too.  I just watched the election returns on the news and they&rsquo;ve declared Obama the winner.  America is in my opinion, finished.  Since it was White people who put this guy in the White House, then it seems America isn&rsquo;t a country worth fighting for anymore.  As for myself and my family, we&rsquo;re headed back to Ireland.  I came to this country as a kid twenty years ago and the conditions here have become intolerable.  </p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t find a link for the election results, but I heard a majority of White Men and Women, each, voted for McCain, by the low 50&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So, if this were an election among only Whites, McCain would most likely be our President, and the only factor preventing the certainty factor would be the Electoral College, if my sources are correct.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t find any hyperlinks for the actual election results, by race. But according to what I heard on the TV, White Men and White Women, each, voted for John McCain, in the low 50&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>So, if my sources are correct, and if the election were among only Whites, John McCain would most likely be our President, not Obama. The only think preventing this would-be certainty is the Electoral College. But still, I think he would have won. </p>

<p>The bad drives out the good, unless the good takes a stand and is very well organized. Any weak point in the armor will be noted and taken advantage of.</p>
<p>My cousin came down to visit this summer. He lives, I think, in Prince William County. His kid just &#8220;graduated&#8221; from elementary school. Had a shirt on with the names of all the kids in his graduating class. Well over half the names were clearly minorities: Hispanics, Orientals, Arabs, and subcontinentals. We&rsquo;re talking about an area that was once almost entirely white.<br>

<p>At least whites are 95% in Ireland, but I read Asians (1.3%) and Black Africans (1.1%) are already immigrating to your country. I think Ireland doesn&rsquo;t need immigrants. The nation&rsquo;s population is the youngest in the European Union and is predicted to grow for many decades, bucking the trend of decline that is predicted for most European countries. Ireland have been experiencing a baby boom for the past few years. That&rsquo;s good. <br>
A French friend is engaged with an Irish guy so she will move to Dublin soon. She was living in Paris but there are many problems there with immigrants and riots. Good for her.<br>

			<p>I feel awefull watching everyone drink this Kool Aid, I voted 3rd party myself, but had hoped the electorate would come to it&rsquo;s senses and vote for McCain.  Looking back everything really started going wrong in Feb when, how I know not, McCain went from Last to First and won the nomination.  The guy would not budge from his obnoxious policies on immigration or &#8220;free&#8221; trade.  Huckabee, Romney, Rudy all would have ran a much better campaign though Tancredo was the best candidate by far.  A great legacy for the ultimate faliure of the presidency of George W. Bush, he drove the country into the ground so bad that a black became president.  Unbelievable, 4 years ago I would have thought it would take them 20 years to soften us up for that one.</p>

			<p>I think the electoral college system is what finally destroyed the U.S. being the means by which the condensed 3rd world new voters and blacks could hand over high electoral votes to their candidates. None of those types wanted Montana (only 2 votes) but look at NJ, Fl, NY and the like those states should be foreign countries in fact, not just in population demography.</p>

			<p>As a conservative, I didn&rsquo;t care for McCain but voted for him anyhow against Obama.  What&rsquo;s happened might be a positive thing in that neoconservatives and moderates might get purged from the party.  If McCain had won the Republicans would have moved further to the left.  It&rsquo;s a small consolation.  I can&rsquo;t help but think that because of the demographic situation, whether it&rsquo;s possible for the GOP to win a national election again. </p>

<p>   Alas, friend, I fear that Shamnasty will bring in so many Third World Immigrants that they will flock to previously all white areas. Even the beloved Shenadoah Valley will probably get it&rsquo;s share of diversity in the long term. </p>

			<p>Congress&rsquo; Democratic majority in BOTH houses will be a double-edged sword for the do-nothing loafers and shysters infesting those &#8220;hallowed halls.&#8221; Because now, the Democrats will not be able to shift the blame on Republicans. Will have to face the careful scrutiny of our nation. Watching every scandal unfold. Every failure by Congress to do the timely or proper thing.</p>
<p>With Obama in the White House, things will certainly be interesting. Bringing to mind that old Chinese curse: &#8220;May you live in interesting times.&#8221; He will either be reasonably successful as pres., he could be a well-intentioned but utterly inept buffoon and failure like Jimmy Carter was&hellip; or become a genuine success story. Time will tell.</p>
<p>If Congress drops the ball, certainly a very good probability in light of Democrats records, this might end up being a virtual death knell for the Dems. Locking them out of power for possibly decades, starting with the 2010 elections. If Obama does turn out to be a Carter-like failure, he may well be America&rsquo;s LAST Black president, as well as its first. We will see!</p>

			<p>We did it!  We finally got a Black President in office! I am so glad and proud of this country.  I am a White Man and I believe that embracing our diversity will help our great country grow into a better place to live. As soon as the White Nationalist learn to accept all types of people in order to achieve happiness.  If you truly love this country you will work hard to work with others to keep this country on top.  Last night was a huge step toward the right direction and it made me feel proud of this country more than ever!</p>

<p>Do you realize how much of a minority those of you who define the far right really are?  There will be no return to the old definition of a conservative.  It&rsquo;s not just demographics, the age we live in has shifted historically because of changes other than having a Black president.  Personally, I hope all Whites can be tolerant enough of each other to succeed in saving our race.</p>

			<p>I too live in Central Virginia and can attest to the problem that Northern Virginia is. What has happened is a lot of liberals have moved here from all over the country for the government and tech jobs. The same thing is happening in some of the counties surrounding Richmond such as Henrico. A little clone of Northern VA. If you look at a map of the election you will find that most localities went for McCain, it&rsquo;s just that numbers were not on his side.</p>

<p>Sorry, Steve.  You&rsquo;re wrong.  If (young) whites hadn&rsquo;t been so indoctrinated by the feds via the public schools, McCain would have pulled this one off.  Obama couldn&rsquo;t win without the white vote.</p>

			<p>If you look at the original article&rsquo;s comments section (even in the liberal Washington Post), they are almost entirely bemoaning diversity coming to their neighborhood.  Non-whites move in, crime skyrockets, place becomes gang infested.  Schools are repositories for little future criminals where test scores plummet (in accordance with NAM IQs), housing values plummet.  Whites move out.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  Happens everywhere that &#8216;diversity blossoms&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What dishonest Western suicidal tripe the Post puts out.</p>
<p>Our very survival is at stake, and there&rsquo;s no voting our way out of it.  I hope there is an awakening, and soon, while we still have the numbers.</p>

			<p>The problem with the electoral college is that states are awarded electoral votes on the basis of total population, not eligible voters.  New York city is now about 40 percent foreign born. So is the entire state of California.</p>
<p>With illegals and other immigrants not eligible to vote invading Texas, California, New York and Illinois, those states alone will soon have the 270 electoral votes needed to elect a president.</p>
<p>But half the population of those states will be ineligible to vote.</p>
<p>California now has 55 electoral votes.  But half the population are immigrants who cannot vote.  At the next census California will probably have 60 or more votes. New York will and Illinois will have at least 25 each and Texas will go from 34 to maybe 40.</p>
<p>Those 4 hispanic invaded states will have at least 140 electoral votes between them at the 2010 census due entirely to hispanic invasion enabled and encouraged by both parties.</p>

<p>I agree with most of your assessment. Our race did fail, in protecting its interests. However, the &#8216;White Vote&rsquo; is the only major racial group to have its majority vote for McCain. Hispanics, and I believe Northeastern (and Southeastern)<br>
Asians voted for Obama, in large majorities. Blacks voted for Obama, almost unanimously. </p>
<p>Without the &#8216;White Vote,&rsquo; Obama would have won, in an even bigger landslide.</p>
<p>I like your statement, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s see what &#8216;they&rsquo; get.&#8221; It&rsquo;s our young new voter population, which voted for Obama. And, it will ironically be Obama&rsquo;s young voters who get drafted. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely gob-smacked that Obama is the new president. His name alone should have caused him to lose the election, not to mention his connection with shady characters. I just can&rsquo;t believe this. And to see former red states turn blue.  Because of the demographic changes it will only be an uphill battle to win the presidency again.  I don&rsquo;t want to say it, but I think America ended on November 4th, 2008.  Now it&rsquo;s just an economic zone or a northern version of Brazil.</p>

			<p>Senate Resolution on 20th anniversary of <b>Fair Housing Act</b> unanimously signed April 3, 2008</p>
<p><i>&hellip;Whereas the Chicago Freedom Movement, which took place from 1965 to 1967 and was led by the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., raised the national consciousness about housing discrimination and shaped the debate that led to landmark fair housing legislation&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Whereas the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson and commonly known as the Kerner Commission, found in 1968 that &lsquo;&lsquo;[o]ur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white &mdash; separate and unequal&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
Whereas Congress passed the Fair Housing Act as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Public Law 90–284; 82 Stat. 73), and President Johnson signed the Act into law on April 11, 1968, one week after the assassination of Dr. King&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;Whereas Congress&rsquo;s intent in passing the Fair Housing Act was broad and inclusive, to advance equal opportunity in housing and <b>achieve racial integration</b> for the benefit of all people in the United States;</p>
<p>Whereas housing integration affects other dimensions of life, including educational attainment, employment opportunities, access to health care and home equity;</p>
<p>Whereas the majority of people in the United States support neighborhood integration and numerous studies have shown the universal benefits of residential integration&hellip;</p>
<p>The purpose is to integrate,  a condition that neither blacks nor whites want.</p>
<p>To think that blacks must be around whites to achieve access to education, health care, adequate housing would be the real epitome of white supremacy. Can liberals grasp this?</p>
<p>So must we deduce that there is indeed a malicious intent involved in forced integration&hellip;.<br>

			<p>To Robert:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you truly love this country you will work hard to work with others to keep this country on top.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is wonderful that you are so happy that a black man got elected President.  However, contrary to the media&rsquo;s reports, Obama is not even a &#8220;black&#8221; man - his mother was white and his father was Kenyan with mixed black African and Arab blood.</p>
<p>You want white nationalists to work with others to keep this country on top? In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, the United States is in decline due in large part BECAUSE of diversity.  Diversity is not a strength but a weakness and anyone with a reasonable degree of logic would realize that.  So while the United States foolishly embraces &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; and our economy falters, people become homeless, banks fail, companies are laying workers off by the thousands, the United States becomes further and further in debt, across the Pacific in a land known as the People&rsquo;s Republic of China which has very little &#8220;diversity&#8221; their economy is growing at 9%, their military is growing, they are the world&rsquo;s manufacturing powerhouse, and they are sitting on approximately $1.5 trillion is reserves, they are rising to become the world&rsquo;s new superpower.  Funny, their lack of &#8220;diversity&#8221; does not seem to hurt them at all, does it?     </p>

<p>&gt; This may be where the collapse beings.  The majority of Army and Marine vounteers have been coming from rural, White, Christian families.  How many of them are left to volunteer and how many will volunteer to serve with Obama as their Commander nad Chief?  Obama supporters are the population for which military service is the last thing on their minds.  That the present military is near exhaustion is not an exaggeration.  The U.S. will either become a nation with ONLY the power a &#8220;finger on the button&#8221; provides with little or no actual conventional military power.  This will make the world much more dangerous.  This may force Obama to re-institute the draft.  A draft will cause draft protests&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; wild ride to ensue.</p>

<p>That depends on the economy. The current recession has significantly improved Army recruiting &amp; retention; an all-out depression would be the Pentagon&rsquo;s dream come true. The <i>really</i> big question is what happens when the economy recovers. If soldiers start leaving in droves, expect a huge increase in stop-loss orders.</p>
<p>BTW, it&rsquo;s a little-known fact that Army personnel who re-enlist after 10 years&rsquo; service do so without a discharge date   &mdash;   IOW, potentially for life. (Call it &#8220;the ultimate stop-loss.&#8221;) I read about this online back in 2002 and the local recruiter confirmed it. The only sure way out is to not get promoted and fall under the &#8220;up or out&#8221; rules. If a lot of long-timers try that trick, expect a whole bunch of mandatory field promotions.</p>
<p>IMHO the real wild card is how many generals will want to serve under Obama. There might be a lot of retirements in the next few months. </p>

			<p>I always work to build-up Caucasians and our culture.  I welcome that others will do this as well. We need to have larger families.  There is power in decency and numbers.  Promote large Caucasisan families and work to hire their sons and daughters.  That is the ticket my brothers and sisters.  Have more babies.  We have right as Americans to protect our own and look our for ourselves.  The rest of the non-white world needs more rubbers.  We need more babies. </p>

			<p>Reality Check, I thought the exact same thing. How can someone named Obama become President. I would have bet a thousand dollars it couldn&rsquo;t be so confident was I. This sure woke me up, as much as it did to you. Then Hussein, really blew me away, and proved one thing to me. It seems most Americans never bought into the war on terror thing and the danger that they felt from people with names like Hussein. Give me a better explanation, someone.</p>
