<h1>Obama&rsquo;s In, But Struggle Not Over</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Howard Witt, Chicago Tribune, Nov. 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the very day that the rest of America elected the first black president in the nation&rsquo;s history, voters in Nebraska approved a referendum banning all government affirmative action programs in the state.</p>
<p>For many Americans, those two developments add up to one conclusion when it comes to the long and bitter struggle over civil rights: Problem solved. Everyone&rsquo;s equal now. Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>Or, as Ward Connerly, the black conservative activist from California who has led a national crusade against race-based affirmative action programs, put it: &ldquo;We have overcome the scourge of race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Civil rights leaders across the country scarcely had time to savor Sen. Barack Obama&lsquo;s unprecedented victory before grappling with an ironic new predicament Wednesday: How to keep the nation&rsquo;s focus on the continuing racial injustices they see when an African-American will be occupying the White House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;ve got a black person in the most powerful and most highly symbolic place, I do expect many white Americans will consider it one less reason for black Americans to whine,&rdquo; said James Rucker, founder of Color of Change, an Internet-based civil rights group with more than 400,000 members. &ldquo;The problem with that is, we still have housing discrimination, hate crimes, the overrepresentation of African-Americans in prison and inequities in education. One election doesn&rsquo;t make all that go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s election feels historically cleansing to Americans of all races who know that when the nation was founded more than 200 years ago, blacks were not even regarded as fully human. But even though the most overt forms of institutional discrimination, such as segregation and bans on interracial marriage, were purged from the nation&rsquo;s lawbooks a generation ago, profound social and economic disparities still divide blacks from whites in America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bean is hopeful that Obama will elevate the importance of civil rights cases in the U.S. Justice Department. And the president-elect already has signaled an interest in expanding the definition of civil rights to encompass economic as well as racial disparities.</p>
<p>But just in case the new administration were to falter, Sharpton said he&rsquo;s prepared to stage one of his signature civil rights protests outside the Obama White House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that would happen, because Obama&rsquo;s commitment to civil rights is basically there,&rdquo; Sharpton said. &ldquo;But if we had to protest, we would.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sick and tired of the mutilation of the English language here in America. According to slightly older dictionaries RACISM is the feeling that a certain race is inferior, just because of their race, what they call racism in America today is any negative comment in particular those refering to blacks, no matter how true of verifiable. I don&rsquo;t call that racism, I&rsquo;d call that realism. If I ordered a load of apples and 90% of them were spoiled, I wouldn&rsquo;t want the work associated with sorting through 100,000 apples to find the 10,000 good ones. I&rsquo;d just avoid the load altogether. Case Closed</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see, what &#8220;injustices&#8221; are left?  I guess things like: paying back a loan they couldn&rsquo;t afford in the first place, not getting a job that they are not qualified for anyway, working for a living, being stopped by a police officer because they live in a high crime area, and getting grades as high as everyone else. I&rsquo;ll stop there for now.  </p>
<p>Just wait until Obama starts appointing ultra-liberal judges, I am sure these injustices will disappear.</p>

<p>It is mindboggling to think how misguided and based on false premises this statement and belief is. What does it actually imply? That a day will come when the charge of &#8220;racism&#8221; by one group or the other will actually go away? But the real question that has never been resolved and never will be is, What is racism? Does it mean allowing, by default, some certain race to always have priority over another race in some situation to avoid charges of racism? What does it mean? </p>

			<p>And the &#8220;struggle&#8221; never will be over. The never-ending witch hunt for &#8220;racists&#8221; (almost always white) has served the left too well for them to give it up willingly, so there will never come a time when the left concedes that we have done everything we can reasonably be expected to do.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Electing Obama &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t make all that [racism] go away.&rdquo; </p>
<p><br>
That&rsquo;s an absolute fact for sure, because black racism will only increase, as it has been doing for years now, and nothing is going to change that.</p>
<p>I wish I had a nickel every time a group of nitwit gullible whites elected a black Sheriff, police chief, mayor, governor, or whatever, thinking that would prove they weren&rsquo;t racists and keep black crime down at the same time, only to have incredibly high incidences of malfeasance in office and black crime and violence increasing to record levels.<br>

			<p>Well, Sharpton et al. don&rsquo;t advocate civil rights as merely a calling, or a cross to bear   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s the way they make a living.  You know, they came to do good, and wound up doing very well indeed.  No matter how left-wing Obama is on race and &#8220;civil rights,&#8221; the Sharptonites will make increasingly more left-wing demands, in order to create a difference between the policies actually adopted and what they think should be, in order to portray themselves as a still-necessary movement that needs money.</p>

			<p>Of course &#8220;the struggle&#8221; will NEVER be over for Blacks. They have gotten rewarded handsomely for playing the eternal victim, they know a good thing when they see it. They&rsquo;ll forever keep whitey on an eternal guilt trip over slavery and Jim Crow. Obama may be president but this is one thing that won&rsquo;t change.</p>

			<p>Some of you on this site was right as rain.</p>
<p>A friend at church came last night and said he was at work, he runs a fence building company, and said he looked up with his crew and there they were.  A group of eight or nine blacks had come over to them and said &#8220;You aren&rsquo;t building no fence around here.&#8221; &#8220;We don&rsquo;t want no fence dividing this area.&#8221;  John said he just looked at them with puzzlement and the next thing they said was classic. &#8220;We have a black man in the white house and now we are in charge.&#8221; It got ugly enough and the police were called.</p>
<p>Thank you dumb liberal white people.</p>
<p>I realize this doesn&rsquo;t deal with the article here but thought I would share it with you.</p>
<p>Thank God I&rsquo;m white! </p>

			<p>     Obama has carte blanche to do whatever he pleases and the media will cover for him by saying that the economic situation was far worse than they were led to believe. The nedia will say that tough times make for tough decisions. Anyone disagreeing will be labeled as a racist. Do you think you&rsquo;ll enjoy life in a labor battalion ?</p>

			<p>I predict that Obama will be the high water mark for the black movement in this country. A lot of truths will finally have to be faced as past rationals will no longer work for even the most oblivious or naive among us.  In addition the complex ethnic makeup will preclude past poor explanations to racial questions.</p>
<p>Also hard economic times will make everyone less amenable to easy, throw money at the issue answers.</p>

<p>If the media were unbiased, this reporter would have talked to many people who would have been glad to point out that those &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; programs were inherently unjust and should never have been implemented in the first place. Or how about the long laundry list of greivances reeled out by Mr. Rucker? All of these are based on certain presuppositions, presuppositions that are never even questioned by the media.</p>
<p>But we all know that the media isn&rsquo;t unbiased, and hasn&rsquo;t been for a long time.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
&#8220;Housing discrimination&#8221;? Isn&rsquo;t part of this financial mess we are in because home loans were given to people-including lots of blacks-who couldn&rsquo;t afford them?&#8221;Hate crimes&#8221;, yeah once again it is only whites that can commit &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; so we need to expand them. &#8220;Overrepresentation of African Americans in Prison&#8221;? I guess Obama needs to go out and round up some white boys and trump up some charges so black people can feel better about themselves. Face it, you could have a government completely run by black people and they would still claim there is &#8220;racism&#8221; because race-hustling pays off for them. </p>

			<p> Obama&rsquo;s election is, indeed, a good reason for blacks to do less whining. But they LIKE to whine. They&rsquo;ve found that it brings panicky concessions from guilt-tripping Whites, especially if the whining carries an undertone of, &#8220;Better give us what we want, or there&rsquo;ll be a long, hot summer!&#8221;</p>
<p> And all this talk in the story about so-called housing discrimination, so-called &#8220;hate crimes,&#8221; and &#8220;too many&#8221; blacks in prison is downright amusing. Where is any proof of these allegations? The writer simply assumes that everyone reading his piece agrees that all these exist, in the form he says they do, and that &#8220;racism&#8221; (whatever he defines that to be) is still seething on the mouths of White America like rabies. Nonsense, piffle and codswallop!</p>

			<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;And the president-elect already has signaled an interest in expanding the definition of civil rights to encompass economic as well as racial disparities&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This statement alone should scare the hell out of every White person alive.</p>
<p>How do you think obama plans to address and &#8216;amend&rsquo; economic disparity? </p>
<p>Perhaps the same way the Soviets and Chinese Communists dealt with economic disparity during and after their bloody revolutions? </p>
<p>Professor Rummel, in his book &#8216;Death by Government&rsquo;, offers the following about China and the USSR&rsquo;s murderous regimes:  China (PRC) 1949–1987 77,277,000 murdered; China (Mao Soviets) 1923–1949 3,465,000 murdered;  U.S.S.R. 1917–1987 61,911,000 murdered. </p>
<p><br>
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=N1j1QdPMockC&amp;dq=Death+by+government&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=0od-qbK4hu&amp;source=bn&amp;sig=W4rxu759aWABPYoVhoF07pFxz-E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPR6,M1" rel="nofollow">https://books.google.com/books?id=N1j1QdPMockC&dq;=Death+by+government&pg;=PP1&ots;=0od-qbK4hu&source;=bn&sig;=W4rxu759aWABPYoVhoF07pFxz-E&hl;=en&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&resnum;=4&ct;=result#PPR6,M1</a></p>
<p><br>
Maybe Zim and SA will be used as shining examples of &#8216;addressing economic disparity&rsquo;  &mdash;  murdering their productive White classes and redistributing their farms and wealth has worked wonders for them, hasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Interesting, isn&rsquo;t it, as other countries are rushing toward market capitalism, developed in the West (in fact, the only system that works), Western countries are running in the exact opposite direction, embracing socialism.</p>
<p>When market capitalism is embraced by third-world countries, City Journal reports the following results: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The results have been breathtaking. Opening economies and promoting trade have helped reconstruct Eastern Europe after 1990 and lifted 800 million people, many of them in China, Brazil, and a now-license-free India, out of poverty.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Even in Africa and the Arab Middle East, nations that have embraced capitalism have begun to escape from the terrible underdevelopment that has long plagued them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_3_economics.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_3_economics.html</a></p>
<p>The market economy is the most efficient of all economic systems.</p>
<p>The old Soviet Union collapsed because its economy proved unworkable.  Why would ANYONE sane believe those same failed policies of forced egalitarianism would work here?</p>
<p>obama stated in his acceptance speech:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;but &#8216;a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Yeah, work harder for big government, that is, which is ready to re-distribute our &#8216;hard work&rsquo; to others &#8216;according to their needs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bon&rsquo;s prediction:  10% unemployment; 10% inflation by next year.</p>
<p>When will we learn?  When will we learn?</p>
<p>Answer: When the government-controlled schools stop teaching statism, including blind loyalty to the government no matter how much damage the government does to the country.</p>

			<p>Here we go again with the same old tired theme; blacks in this country working against the national interest, while other countries in the world like China and Taiwan-that don&rsquo;t have the problems associated with multiculturism and racial diversity-are slowly buying up our country-which will eventually lead to a friendly economic takeover. </p>

			<p>All I can say is that I am so glad I am White.  As a White person I know;  1. I can go anywhere and do well. 2. I neither desire nor need hand outs to make it. 3. I can take a great deal of pride in my ancestry with a straight face.  Yes, it&rsquo;s great to be White.  To those pathetic Whites who don&rsquo;t feel the same way, paint your skin please, you don&rsquo;t deserve to be one of us and are an embarrassment to your kind. To the good White folks who feel a bit depressed and downtrodden right now, pick yourselves up. dust yourself off and go to work. Work harder for yourselves and for your families and for your race.  This is your wake up call, there&rsquo;s no time to waste.</p>

<p>First, the Civil War&hellip;  About 620,000 white troops, North and South, died in the struggle for the freedom of about 4,000,000 black slaves.</p>
<p>Then, 100 years later, the Civil Rights Movement&hellip;  Since then, special privileges and constant pay-outs for the black citizens of this country.</p>
<p>Finally, Barack Hussein Obama&hellip;  President of the United States of America.</p>
<p>I rest my case.</p>

			<p>Granted, Obama might be the media&rsquo;s darling today. But stupid as Americans were, in voting for Obama&hellip; there is no guarantee that they won&rsquo;t unceremoniously toss him out in 2012. Which happened to Jimmy Carter, also a president espousing &#8220;change.&#8221; (Carter wanted to get rid of the Nixon stench hanging over the White House. First his vice. prez, Spiro Agnew, resigned in disgrace. Then Nixon himself. Ford was selected by Nixon to replace Agnew. Then pardoning the disgraced Nixon after Ford replaced him in the presidency.)</p>
<p>In Obama&rsquo;s case, things are different. The economy stinks. We are embroiled in two costly wars, thanks to the Village Idiot currently in the White House and his trusty side-kick. The banking/lending industry required a bail-out which the worthless political hacks promptly earmarked with another 130 BILLION of our tax dollars. (It might be pointed out, Democrats control Congress, so are deemed equally guilty in the ear-marking scandal hanging on the bail-out.)</p>
<p>Also with a strong Democratic majority in both houses, the Dems are hardly going to escape the doodoo flying around, if Obama (and Congress) can&rsquo;t reverse the current mess, p.d.q.</p>
<p>As to turning off those two wars, avoiding being blackmailed into attacking Iran, turning off the mess in Pakistan we&rsquo;re getting into&hellip; will be a tough order for even Obama, the Magnificent. After the last Americans left Vietnam, the Pol Pot regime was responsible for a bloodbath that killed MILLIONS of Laotians, Cambodians, Vietnamese. A scenario that, on a smaller scale, will probably repeat after we pull out of Iraq and the other countries.</p>
<p>Predictably, the Russian Bear will grab a lot of influence in that part of the world, capitalizing handsomely on the American withdrawal, claiming we DESERTED our allies and friends.</p>
<p>So like I say, Obama, the Magnificent, will have a very tough road ahead of him. With those same gullible fools who were dumb enough to have VOTED for him, expecting instant miracles. But not being smart enough to understand he can&rsquo;t work miracles, will lose faith and help dump him four years from now.</p>
<p>The media can TRY to excuse Obama&rsquo;s failings and shortcomings. But still, people judge by what they see. (Like the body counts, casualties heard about, as the result of Bush&rsquo;s and Cheney&rsquo;s greedy stupidity in launching those wars.) So not seeing conditions improve dramatically in very short order, most Americans will hold it against both Obama and the strongly Democratic Congress.</p>
<p>Which certainly will be a windfall for the Republicans, if they have the smarts to capitalize on it. They need to regroup, certainly. Just as they need to plan to retake Congress, starting in 2010 and the White House in 2012. The latter, of course, ruling out Palin taking a stab at getting herself into the presidential race. Personality not withstanding, she simply has far too much bad baggage to EVER make the White House.</p>
<p>Even (shudder) Bush&rsquo;s lying mouthpiece, Condoleeza Rice, is by far the better choice in that regard. Although having been known far and wide as steadfastly LYING for G.W.B. and his utterly failed administration, her credibility among thinking, rational people is zilch. Bet also that the Clintons will be doing their damndest to sabotage Obama&rsquo;s hope for a second term. Given Hillary probably wants to run in 2012. With her loyal fans cheering her in the sidelines. People, it might be pointed out, have little love for Obama, having voted FOR Obama soley to keep McCain from winning.</p>
<p>So let the media slaver over their current darling, Obama, the Magnificent. In politics, as in life, the only constant thing is &#8220;change.&#8221; With a fair possibility that by 2010, American voters will be so disgused with Obama and Congress, the Republicans will made the same inroads then, as the Democrats did in 2006.</p>

The Whites I know who think like this are those who have had good careers as government or private corporative employees and are not small business owners.  Go to Africa or an Islamic country, or even an EU nation, and try to do anything, but specifically get a job.   Try to get a government job, especially Federal, but State and County too.

			<p>The struggle for existence is never ending. That&rsquo;s nature for you. Part of the struggle in human terms involves things of the mind, and on that level many whites are losing the struggle to exist.  </p>
<p>For evidence of this, just look at some of the posts on this site as many whites run from being &#8220;racists&#8221;  &mdash;  read, run from knowing they&rsquo;re white and feeling good in a quiet way about it and wanting to remain white and also to keep their families white.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to hate people of other colors to want to remain white and understand that we whites are a very tiny minority on this dark planet and that we need to struggle righteously to remain a distinct people.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to become black.  Just stop wanting to be white and it may eventually happen to you or to your children. It takes struggle and effort to remain white.  It is that way on a cosmic scale and on the earthly scale. (Okay, I&rsquo;m stopping and won&rsquo;t get into this more deeply.  AS far as this post goes, you either get it or you don&rsquo;t.)</p>

<p>That is a direct qhote from a whiteness studies class.  All whites are required to stand up and say &#8220;I am white.&#8221;  &#8220;Iam privileged.&#8221;  &#8220;Everything is given to me because I am white.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Naturally, nary a shred of gratitude for the overwhelming white support, and a continual hammering about how the tired old raceploitation schtick must NOT stop.</p>
<p>Mark my words, when Obama screws up, they&rsquo;re going to blame the white supporters for having done so, even though they bullied the non-supporters with accusations of racism.  It will be just like how the blacks in New Orleans blame the whites because they supported Nagin for his first term.  Even though he was overwhelmingly voted for a second term by blacks simply for being black and playing the race card through the whole election.  You see, he messed up during Katrina, and that was still his first term, so that&rsquo;s our fault.  His continual dysfunction and amazing failure- well, that&rsquo;s just okay, because that&rsquo;s when he became &#8220;their&#8221; mayor.  Except when it&rsquo;s particularly egregious.  Then it&rsquo;s whitey&rsquo;s fault again for helping put him there in the first place, two elections ago.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t win.  This is why I&rsquo;m laughing at the people on this site who wanted to support Obama, because then, they thought, blacks would run out of ammunition for their endless complaints.  It just doesn&rsquo;t work that way, people.  You haven&rsquo;t yet figured out blacks.</p>
<p>Everything will always be whitey&rsquo;s fault.  Just like Detroit, like the Congo, they&rsquo;ll still blame whites long after there are no whites left to blame.  Each triumph, each concession, only emboldens them towards worse behavior and ever increasing blame.</p>
<p>You have never heard blame whitey tirades in your life like you&rsquo;re going to hear over this election.  If there ever is a black pope- sheesh, then they&rsquo;ll blame us for hell.  You could make a black guy God, and they&rsquo;d blame us for every flaw of the Universe.  Yet they would still fight each other and watch the world decay.</p>
<p>This is the reality of how it works.  The race card is the only tool in their box.</p>

			<p>Like anyone who has spent anytime online since the election, I have been fascinated at how quickly Obamas success has gone to the heads of many blacks, who now feel it is not only their time, but think that they are about to rule the world. However, when some of them are reminded that they should no longer expect affirmative action, or to quit crying about being held down by whitey, they insist that none of that a black president will not resolve these issues. They literally want to have their cake, and eat it too.</p>

<p>And I will continue to hold this view until I am shown positive proof otherwise.  I have seen NO measure of anything other than that the government schools (including so-called charter schools) promote statism, have done so for at least 30 years, and will continue to do so far into the foreseeable future. These schools are neither changing nor going away.</p>
<p>Statism (Dictionary.com): &#8220;&hellip;the principle or policy of concentrating extensive economic, political, and related controls in the state at the cost of individual liberty&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Read a high school textbook lately? I have because I&rsquo;ve worked with them for the past 25 years.  They heavily promote multi-culturalism, egalitarianism (at the expense of Whites), socialism and sob stories about non-Whites and &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; triumphing over evil, vicious, racist Whites who are hell-bent on holding them down. ALL schools are mandated to use these textbooks.</p>
<p>This is the main reason I pulled my youngest son out of the government-controlled schools two years ago and advise everyone to do the same, if possible. I have never looked back. In California, there is a very strong drive to put an end to home schooling  &mdash;  I fear at some point with the legislature as Marxist as it is, this movement will win, either through legislation or by judicial fiat.</p>
<p>I know of no movement working to over turn the ingrained bureaucracy of the government schools. There are many people in high positions whose job it is to keep the schools in their current state, and damn the costs. The new change in regime promises to entrench the schools further in government-controlled idiocy  &mdash;  especially since obama has promised to &#8216;address disparities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charles Murray calls this Educational Romanticism.  I call it Educational Fraud.  Fraud that has cost this country trillions of dollars &mdash; with promises of a lot more money  &mdash;   fire-hosed and dropped from helicopters into the schools&rsquo; gaping maws.</p>
<p>As much as we rail at the leftist MSM (with good reason), I believe government school indoctrination is far more dangerous. What else could possibly explain the recent election results with a majority voting for open socialists everywhere? The recently re-elected lefty in my district has vowed to &#8216;increase Head Start&rsquo; as his first order of business and then welcome the &#8216;homeless&rsquo; by expanding homeless shelters in the area (not around where he lives, of course). </p>
<p>If you are suggesting that it is possible to take on and change the government schools, I&rsquo;d like to hear your ideas. I agree that we have &#8216;but a few hours&rsquo;  &mdash;  but I do not believe it is possible at this point to fight &#8216;The Beast&rsquo; because &#8216;The Beast&rsquo; has won. And I see no change with the current demographic situation as it is. </p>

<p>See article 25 of UN declaration of human rights.  Cassiodorus wonders why I keep posting this.  The first part has no filter of disabled- it says EVERYONE.  Disability comes after &#8220;AND the right to security&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Article 25.<br>
(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. </p>
<p>(2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;EVERYONE&#8221; seems to imply that able minded/bodied could refuse work and still collect- indeed, I have heard that this is true in some Euro welfare states.</p>
