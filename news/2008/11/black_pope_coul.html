<h1><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5097668.ece">Black Pope Could Follow Barack Obama&rsquo;s Election, Says US Archbishop</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Owen, Times (London), Nov. 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The election of Barack Obama as the first African-American US President could pave the way for the election of the first black Pope, according to a leading black American Catholic. </p>
<p>Wilton Daniel Gregory, 60, the Archbishop of Atlanta, said that in the past Pope Benedict XVI had himself suggested that the election of a black pontiff would &ldquo;send a splendid signal to the world&rdquo; about the universal Church. </p>
<p>Archbishop Gregory, who in 2001 became the first African American to head the US Bishops Conference, serving for three years, said that the election of Mr Obama was &ldquo;a great step forward for humanity and a sign that in the United States the problem of racial discrimination has been overcome&rdquo;. Like Mr Obama Archbishop Gregory comes from Chicago, and was previously Bishop of Belleville, Illinois. </p>
<p>He said that recent Popes, beginning with John XXIII and Paul VI, had brought prelates &ldquo;from all nations and races&rdquo; to Rome to take up senior positions in the Curia, the Vatican hierarchy. This offered &ldquo;an international vision of a Church rich in diversity&rdquo;, he told the Italian newspaper La Stampa. </p>
<p>Pope Benedict &mdash; whose next encyclical is on globalisation and social justice &mdash; had a &ldquo;world outlook&rdquo; as a theologian whose thought had &ldquo;opened hearts and minds on five continents&rdquo;, Archbishop Gregory said. The former Joseph Ratzinger, who as a young man in his native Germany had witnessed &ldquo;the horrors of the Second World War&rdquo;, spoke a &ldquo;universal language&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Archbishop Gregory said that the next time cardinals gathered to elect a Pope they could &ldquo;in their wisdom&rdquo; choose an African pontiff. &ldquo;My own election as head of the US Bishops Conference was an important signal. In 2001 the American bishops elected someone they respected regardless of his race, and the same thing could happen with the election of a Pope.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He said that in a papal conclave, the cardinal-electors were &ldquo;guided by the Holy Spirit to choose the person who best responds to the exigences of the moment&rdquo;. At the last conclave in 2005, after the death of John Paul II, it was widely thought that the cardinals would choose a Third World pontiff, perhaps from Africa or Latin America. </p>
<p>The choice of Cardinal Ratzinger, who had been at John Paul II&rsquo;s side for over twenty years as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, was seen by many as a vote for a man who embodied continuity and had stressed the need to shore up the faith in the West itself in an age of secularism and materialism. </p>
<p>This week Pope Benedict XVI congratulated Mr Obama on his &ldquo;historic&rdquo; victory, offering his prayers for the President-elect &ldquo;and for all the people of the United States&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said that the Pope&rsquo;s message was &ldquo;personal&rdquo; and would therefore not be published. However he said that the papal message referred to the &ldquo;historic occasion&rdquo; of the election and congratulated Mr Obama, his wife and family. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He assured him of his prayers that God would help him with his high responsibilities for his country and for the international community,&rdquo; Father Lombardi said. The Pope had also prayed that &ldquo;the blessing of God would sustain him and the American people so that with all people of good will they could build a world of peace, solidarity and justice.&rdquo; The message was sent via Mary Ann Glendon, the US ambassador to the Holy See. <br>

		<p>The Christian cross is on the flags of Britain, England, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland and Greece. Christianity is the brand of white Europe.  </p>
<p>Churches who teach Christianity to non-whites are building them a bridge out of their culture into ours, with disastrous results. </p>

		<p>We will now have racial spoils system enter into chosing the Pope. African, African-American, Phillipino, Chinese, Indian would be an appropriate order to follow until at last you could again elect an Italian pope again.</p>

		<p>There are blacks who have earned their way into almost every endeavor of life on the planet:  scientist, businessman, clergyman, artist, scholar.   There are just very very few of them.  The vast majority of blacks are simply not equipped to live in a non stone age world.  And while both Christianity and Islam are more than welcoming them as members, they are what they are.  Racial tokenism only reinforces the belief among blacks that the world owes them something.  The more you give them, the more they demand, the less they like you.  If blacks can learn how it works, why can&rsquo;t Whites?</p>

		<p>Actually, catholic means universal in Greek.  Catholic monks reached China as early as 300AD.  Peking had a Catholic bishop who reported to Rome in 1200 AD. EThopia converted very early on and remained faithful to christianity even though it was totally cut off from Rome by the muslims for centuries.</p>
<p>Christianity began in Palestine.  Armenia was the first country to make christianity the state religion.  The Egypt of 50-300 AD had the highest percentage of christians of any  country, many more than Italy.</p>
<p>An African black Pope would be a good way to stick it to the Muslims.  Probably a lot of Africans would convert because they hoped that the &#8220;big man&#8221; in the vatican would take care of them, just as many Africans, not even Kenyans think Obama will take care of them.</p>
<p>The original christians hoped that the entire world would be converted to christianity.</p>
<p>So it is no really that bad of an idea.  Western catholics left the church in droves after Pope John 23 got rid of the Latin Tridentine mass.  Big mistake, it was the most appealing part of catholicism.  Now the services are just a bunch of old hippies trying to sing and play their guitars.  The whole thing is really embarassing, to watch.</p>
<p>Christianity and islam are at war in Africa.  The christian&rsquo;s main weapon is that christianity does not forbid alcohol.  Islam&rsquo;s main attraction is polygamy, promiscuity and rape permitted for men.</p>

		<p>The Affirmative Action Archbishop refers to this promotion thusly: &#8220;In 2001 the American bishops elected someone they respected regardless of his race, and the same thing could happen with the election of a Pope.&#8221; </p>
<p>Of course this sentence makes no sense. A token black pope would not be elected &#8220;regardless of his race&#8221; but because of it. </p>

		<p>The Catholic Church has serious problems in Europe, there are less priests and less Catholics. Islam is the fastest-growing religion there because of the immigrants. Some consider this the Third Islamic Invasion of Europe, but this time Muslims have the consent of stupid European politicians who are welcoming Muslims as part of our World diversity. If this tendency continues, in less than a century the beautiful European cathedrals will be converted in mosques as Turks did when they conquered Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, in 1453.<br>
The Catholic Church considers Latin America as their last hope, so I think they will choose a Latin American Pope after Benedict XVI.</p>
<p>Islam converts change face of Europe:<br>

		<p>In the last forty-five years all I heard is that &#8221; race &#8221; shouldn&rsquo;t matter, than at the same time,they(liberal,aka, Marxists are then critical of the &#8221; white Christian race &#8221; for controlling everything &#8221; that is theirs and everything that they created ; da ? If whites don&rsquo;t deserve to preserve the &#8221; fruits of their labors &#8221;, non-whites and non-Christans do ? Who is better at creating then maintaining Western Culture caused mostly by white-Christians then white-Christians.</p>

		<p>The Pope is supposed to be selected by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, not the false god of diversity.  These phonies should go back to worshiping Jesus, not their multicultural idols.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a Catholic myself, and my personal experience has shown that the Church has grown more corrupt and wicked than ever before.  First it allows homosexuals to become clergymen, it imports African colonists into white countries, it wastes billions on Africa, and now it wants to give the most powerful position in the entire Church to an African just to look cool.  What a waste.  </p>
<p>The Church will have to fall apart before it can rebuild itself again.</p>

<p>This would not surprise me. The Roman Church, according to the Orthodox, (who are equally as old, as valid, and as numerous in Europe,) consider Rome to have departed into heresy over 1000 years ago.</p>
<p>Such an act would only confirm that premise.</p>

		<p>A BLACK Pope next? Well, now you can understand why the Roman Catholic Church is and has been on a steady down-hill slide. But wait&hellip;  How about a minor change or two: Frinstance&hellip; A HOMOSEXUAL MARRIED Black pope. Married to another man that is. After all, WHY exclude anything that many of us might find degenerate, repulsive or abhorring</p>
