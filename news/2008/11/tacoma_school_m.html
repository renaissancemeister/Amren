<h1>Tacoma School May Be Named for Obama</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, November 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new middle school under construction in Tacoma could be named for president-elect Barack Obama.</p>
<p>But district policy on school names requires people to be dead at least two years or to have already served a presidential term.</p>
<p>Superintendent Art Jarvis asked the school board to alter the policy at the Dec. 11 meeting and put Obama&rsquo;s name in the running.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the rules that have been set in place over many, many years through long deliberation, years of experience and just plain common sense, then just throw them out, I always say. Kind of like those pesky laws concerning immigration.</p>

			<p>I personally don&rsquo;t care but it&rsquo;s the community that will suffer when the school&rsquo;s name draws a black majority student body and thus becomes low performing.  The name Obama will likely carry the same stigma as anything named Martin Luther King Jr.   </p>

If this comes to pass, Obama&rsquo;s head will not be added to Mt. Rushmore, put plastered over an existing member.  And that would be an appropriate symbol of what is happening to our culture.</p>

			<p>Compared to Bush, anybody would look like a hero.  I&rsquo;m sure he will be better than Bush in some ways - but worse in others and the leftist mass media will hide his flaws from the public and defend him when this is not possible.  Therefore we can expect much more of the same in the future.</p>

Yes, the rules never apply to blacks and must be fluid as to be arbitrarily changed on a whim.</p>
<p>This is why black communities are the way they are. The rules which have evolved in white societies for very good reasons are simply rejected. No rules leads to no order.</p>
<p>Blacks disregard common sense community standards just because they don&rsquo;t want to follow basic rules or believe the rules should apply to them. On small points this might be nothing more annoying than not returning the garbage tote to the back of the house for a few days.</p>
<p>However, the less likely you are to follow and respect the small rules, the less likely you are to follow and respect larger rules. The result is what we see in every black majority neigbhood: chaos and dysfunction.</p>
<p>When rules can be changed or broken without consideration, it&rsquo;s like having no rules at all which is what you find in the lawlessness of black communities.</p>

			<p>Why not play by the rules set for other Presidents?  Why not wait till he actually does something to inspire people to honor him?  Could it be that with half of the population despising him and the other half busy creating hype over him that expectations from either side of the aisle are, dare I say it, low?</p>

			<p>Comrade Obama is so underqualified for the presidency, it isn&rsquo;t even funny.  He was supported and funded by a bunch of yellow livered, white radicals, intent for years to subvert the Founding Fathers intentions for this country.  Obama owes his allegiance and a lot more to a lot of people, hiding in the shadows.  He could never have won otherwise.  Now he has surrounded himself with Clintonistas.  It is so obvious that this guy is just a puppet.  The real power lies behind the curtain, like the Wizard of Oz.  Only thing is I&rsquo;m really scared of those people hiding behind the curtain.</p>
<p>The renaming of streets and schools to honor this fake is the least of our worries.  It&rsquo;s what his handlers and real bosses have planned for us that worries me.</p>

Yes, soon to be getting some &#8220;change you can believe in&#8221;  when they get an Obama of  their own _- which they have shown themselves very enthusiastic to do.</p>

			<p>His designation of &#8216;office&rsquo; was what he wanted, I&rsquo;m sure. His arrogance will forever shine through. You have to be that arrogant to last this long with nothing to go on. </p>
<p>The Obama-Messiah must have been in the works for at least a decade. People have been planning his &#8216;rule&rsquo; for at least this long. (Curiously, do Middle Easterners speak of their leaders as &#8216;ruling&rsquo;? I would think, YES.)I know who has funded him. Obama knew he could get by with it being undocumented. He knew the policies of the U.S. are a joke. He&rsquo;s playing the people of the U.S. for a fool because he knew he could. People who voted for him should have cared. </p>
<p>Who supported him even in his younger/educational years? <br>
What job besides &#8216;community organizer&rsquo; has he ever had, really? <br>
(I know people think we&rsquo;re talking about any other politican, but I thought he was &#8216;black&rsquo;. He couldn&rsquo;t have gone the same route as other white politicans, now could he?)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking his Marxist ideals won&rsquo;t hurt me as much as some because I&rsquo;m not a big money maker. He&rsquo;s still wrong. But, I&rsquo;m scared of the seeds he&rsquo;s going to plant and the openings he&rsquo;s going to make. </p>

			<p>I evoked the wrath of a liberal lady last week when I ironically exclaimed, &#8220;Hail Obama.  Hail Atlantis!&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&rsquo;ve got four years of it.  So, suck it up, Brother.  We are going to fix this country,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Primitive societies, in general, are characterized by the search for military or cultural heroes and it is curious to see that same yearning in the modern left.  Its demigods may not be insulted.  You can make fun of Jesus but you can&rsquo;t make fun of blacks.</p>

<p>Those are excellent questions, and throughout the entire campaign they (and others) went both unasked and unanswered   &mdash;   which is to the shame of McCain, who was so timid and deferential that he dared not ask any hard-hitting questions that might appear disrespectful or (horrors!) racist.  The public has a right to know who it is they are voting for.  Too much about Obama&rsquo;s background remains unclarified or shrouded in mystery   &mdash;   even now!  We still don&rsquo;t even know if he is a US citizen for sure.</p>
<p>So McCain lost &hellip; serves him right!  It almost looks like it was set up to be this way.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this could set a bad precedent. Unless the pattern is broken soon, in any future election campaign between a black and a white candidate, the white one will always be at an automatic disadvantage because he will have to tiptoe around the issues in order to avoid appearing insulting or &#8220;racist&#8221;, while the black (always presumed to be the underdog) is under no such prohibitions.</p>

			<p>I think McCain is too hot-heated. He probably couldn&rsquo;t have handled himself in revealing the true Obama. He had to balance between the votes of Hispanics, females, etc. But, someone should have put it out there. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great that a President is a war veteran (understanding the importance of a strong military and national security), but McCain overplayed that. (Clinton had bin Laden in the cross-hairs 3 times and didn&rsquo;t act. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t a bad President, but he is a bad human being. He weakened our military. Then Bush gets blamed in his handling of 9/11.) While Obama was waiting it out and learning as he went, McCain should have given some specifics on issues that concerned everyone. In the end, Obama seemed to have more specific solutions than McCain did. </p>
<p>After far-left representatives are elected, they usually govern towards the center. Can we be so lucky this time? </p>
