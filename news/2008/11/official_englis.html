<h1><a href="/ ">Official English Wins by a Landslide in Missouri</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, ProEnglish.org, Nov. 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&ldquo;Voters spoke decisively Tuesday on a ballot measure in Missouri to enact English as the official language of their state government,&rdquo; says K.C. McAlpin, executive director of ProEnglish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our organization urged Missourians to vote &lsquo;yes&rsquo; on constitutional amendment No. 1 to enshrine English as the official language in the state constitution,&rdquo; McAlpin said. &ldquo;Unfortunately the United States is one of the few countries in the world without an official language. So having official English in a state constitution is important to protect it from being thrown out by activist judges who want to substitute their own rule for that of the people,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Missouri measure won by 89 percent in a state that narrowly split its presidential vote between Barack Obama and John McCain,&rdquo; McAlpin notes. &ldquo;This landslide vote confirms national polls reflecting that a vast majority of Americans &mdash; Democrat, Republican and independent &mdash; reject costly and confusing multilingualism and support English as our nation&rsquo;s official language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this means exactly what? Here&rsquo;s something to think about. English is Californias &#8220;official language&#8221;. Yep. Not kidding.</p>

		<p>&#8220;89 percent of Missourians vote to make English the official language.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and Geraldo Rivera insisted the announcement of the results of the vote be made in Spanish, and then wondered why everybody thought he was an idiot.</p>

		<p>This was the only time that real nationalism was on the ballot in Missouri.  And guess what?  86% of the vote.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only Republican to win a state government statewide office was Lt. Gov Peter Kinder for re-election, whom I wanted to lose.  He panders to blacks way too much for my comfort.  The Kinders and Limbaugh families are good friends in Cape Girardeau.</p>

<p>Believe me, it is important to get this codified into law quickly.</p>
<p>I live in Canada, which has two &#8216;official languages&rsquo; English and French.  It causes many problems and adds to the cost of government. </p>
<p>In some areas where there are immigrant communities, they want their Chinese, Pakistani, and Somali languages expressed on signage, and this encroachment is moving from a courtesy to an expected right.</p>

I would like to see this as the victory that it is but I know how it&rsquo;s going to be turned into a rallying cry of hate from the left. Instead of empowering others to fight the fight, it&rsquo;s going to be ammunition for the haters to strike back.</p>
<p>Geraldo Rivera is ranting at every opportunity by condemning the Republicans for their lack of support for amnesty and for failing to pander for the hispanic vote.<br>

		<p>Nice finger-in-the-dike effort, but the inundation of this country by third world immigrants, primarily Spanish speaking, will continue, and it will soon be a simple thing to reverse this by plebiscite even if judical relief is not forthcoming.  </p>
<p>I find it amazingly ironic that English will continue to be the international language of business and most other activities for centuries to come, long after there ceases to be any English-speaking country in the world.  The parallels with the Roman Empire and the Latin language are inescapable.</p>

		<p>Citizens need to pass referendums in states that mandate the people&rsquo;s referendums over rule any courts/judges decisions. The Constitution grants most decisions to the states and The People have first say in those rights.  Otherwise, we are living in an UNConstitutional state.  <br>
English was and has always been USA founding language and until the last decades there was never a need to require an official language. Passing laws means little to the general immigrating public.  Few people keep the laws.  Just look at elected/corp officials and immigrants.  They do what they like.  Enforcement is rare. USA has become a state of chaos with multicultures of no interest in our history/heritage. These people steal into or are imported to USA for political dominance.  It has been very effective.  Who is responsible??  Why is there no punishment??<br>
USA has effective immigration laws.  There is no political will to enforce them.  This is why energy is being wasted upon ridiculous issues which do not belong in USA dialogue.   V<br>

		<p> Means nothing. When they finish displacing the people with ILLEGAL ALIENS who speak a different language whats the difference? If the state bird was the dodo bird which is exstinct what difference would that make?</p>

		<p>A hollow victory.  Only race-blind Islamophobic neo-cons will celebrate.  The vast majority of Blacks and Browns (think India/Arabs) speak English with some degree of proficiency.  The British Empire invaded the world and now the world is returning the favour to its colonial daughters.</p>

<p> This person has it right; when millions of law abiding citizens can be overruled by a person in long black robes, that&rsquo;s pure dictatorship. It needs to come to an end.</p>
