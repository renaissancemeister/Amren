<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27582147/">Young Voters Not Essential to Obama Win</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Curry, MSNBC, November 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>AnaMaria Arumi, who directs the exit poll desk for NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo, has done the calculations based on the exit poll data and here is what she found: On a state-by-state level, when she re-ran the numbers as if there were no voters under 30, the only states that would switch to Republican presidential candidate John McCain are Indiana and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Without younger voters, Obama would still have won the 270 electoral votes he needs to become the next president.</p>
<p><b>What if there were no Latino voters?</b></p>
<p>In a counter-factual world in which there were no Latino voters, both New Mexico and Indiana would have switched into the McCain column. But Obama would have still won the electoral vote.</p>
<p>However, Arumi said, in the make-believe world where no African-Americans voted, while Obama still would have won most of the states that he won, McCain would have been able to take the hotly contested states of Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.</p>
<p>The 107 electoral votes from those states would have been enough to shift the map in McCain&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Young voters in Virginia vs. Oklahoma</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But for a contrast, take a state where McCain did very well, such as Oklahoma. In the Sooner State, just as in Virginia, about one-fifth of the voters were under age 30. And McCain won 60 percent of them. Not surprisingly McCain carried Oklahoma by a big margin, 32 percentage points.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And younger voters in a heavily Democratic state such as California were not decisive in the outcome, just as their older aunts and uncles in California were not either.</p>
<p>That is because Democratic presidential candidates win California by such huge margins that the outcome there was never in doubt. Strategists knew at the outset that they could move California&rsquo;s 55 electoral votes to the Democratic column.</p>
<p><b>What do we really know about the votes?</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the discussion about the relative importance of one demographic group or another is based on exit poll interviews with voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, we still can look at a predominantly Latino or black congressional districts or counties. Census data can help us assess how black or Latino voters cast their ballots.</p>
<p>In Allendale County, South Carolina, for instance, Obama won 75 percent of the vote, making that his best county in a state he lost. That&rsquo;s an actual vote count, not exit poll data.</p>
<p>According to the Census, 71 percent of Allendale County&rsquo;s population is black. We can infer that most African-American voters in the county voted for Obama, but we still don&rsquo;t know for certain how white and blacks voted in the county.</p>
<p>Nationally, the exit poll interviews indicated that:</p>
<p># 61 percent of Obama&rsquo;s votes came from white voters; 90 percent of McCain&rsquo;s came from white voters.</p>
<p># 23 percent of Obama&rsquo;s votes came from black voters; only one percent of McCain&rsquo;s came from African American voters.</p>
<p># Latino voters accounted for 11 percent of Obama&rsquo;s vote and six percent of McCain&rsquo;s.</p>
<p># Twenty-three percent of the Obama voters were under age 30 but only 13 percent of McCain backers were.</p>
<p><b>Surge of young voters?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The purported &#8220;surge&#8221; of younger voters did happen, but it occurred at the same time as the number of voters of other ages also increased.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, the age distribution of voters looks the same as it did in 2004,&#8221; Arumi said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But what did shift is the vote preference of each group. Obama outperformed 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry with all age groups except seniors. His biggest gains were among those 25-29 years old.<br>

			<p>Soon the day will come, when even 100% of the European-American votes will not be enough to obtain the majority of the votes in a presidential election.</p>
<p>European-Americans HAVE TO PREPARE for this situation.</p>
<p>European America (=the traditional America) can only survive if you do not shy away from fateful decisions like LARGE SCALE PARTITION.</p>
<p>Your situation is similar to that of a patient with a SEVERE GANGRENE on a limb. You need to amputate in order to save the live of the person. <br>
The alternative is death (= to become food for worms and bacteria).</p>

			<p>What was essential to the Obama victory?  Enough working class whites in certain states (PA, OH) that aren&rsquo;t ubiquitously black like MS, so they don&rsquo;t live close to the problem.  Those voters were frustrated by the economy.</p>

			<p>I just read somewhere that the vote total was identical to 2004, with the only states showing significantly higher turnout being southern states with large black populations.  Most of those state went Republican.  Essentially, then, large numbers of whites in other states stayed away or switched their votes.  Had McCain actually run as a loyal Republican and hit the hot buttons of illegal immigration, Wall Street bailouts, and a sensible foreign policy (troops out of Iraq), he could have won.  I find it ironic that the very voters that McCain maligned in the south and west were the ones who showed up for him.  He did not deserve their loyalty and we don&rsquo;t deserve to be treated the way the Dole/Bush/McCain people have been treating us the past 20 years.  Note to Republican HQ: get rid of Karl Rove before he does any more damage.</p>

			<p>This reinforces what the AR classic article from today, also makes reference to: Latinos, African-Americans and Asians in the United States all vote in a racially-conscious manner (for Barack Obama, and specifically with rewards for their groups in mind), while Whites do so to a more limited extent.  Moreover, as the proportion of American Whites dwindles in the population, politicians must pander increasingly to Latinos and Blacks, who will in any case soon be a majority outright.  At which point our political power, indeed our civilization in North America, just disappears.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a trip I made a while ago to a town with a heavy Danish and other Scandinavian-American presence.  They were proud of their Scandinavian ancestry and determined to further that civilization.  With Barack Obama even then dominating in the polls, we all came to a similar conclusion.  There was no animosity toward Obama (even though people were not voting for him), and nobody would begrudge his undoubted accomplishment in advancing as he did.  Our common source of deep despondence, however, is what Obama&rsquo;s rise and ultimate victory signify: That the United States, and North America in general, are now on a headlong and unstoppable course toward the dispossession of White civilization.  It&rsquo;s only going to get much worse from here, since the White population in North America is rapidly falling, while the Black, Asian and especially Latino populations are rising fast.  So what now?</p>
<p>Many of the families around there were preparing a &ldquo;round-trip ticket&rdquo; so to speak &mdash;  returning to their ancestral homes in Denmark, Sweden or Norway to raise their kids there, even those who&rsquo;ve been here many generations.  (Denmark, in particular, is a jewel of a country &mdash;  hard-working and friendly people, great cities, good food and determination to preserve their civilization.)  I also encountered several German-American families (again, many generations removed) that are doing the same thing, returning to raise their kids in Germany.  And apparently this is becoming very common, as the now oft-referenced US News and World Report article from July points out, with up to 3 million Americans leaving every year, mostly for Continental Europe (definitely not Britain, which is worse than here) interestingly enough: https://tinyurl.com/5snb4j .  </p>
<p>So, I ask, partly out of curiosity and partly as a natural consequence of the way I think for my job (I help analyze data on population queries)- &mdash;  is that what people are inclining toward these days?  I personally have a predilection to &ldquo;stay and fight,&rdquo; but how?  Short of a hopefully peaceful partition like what Czechoslovakia experienced  &mdash;   likely with some rough geographical approximation of racial/ethnic concentrations in North America, and probably liberal Whites separating from the more racially conscious bulk of the population  &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t see any future for our people in North America.  Certainly, just staying in a US according to the current borders isn&rsquo;t an option &mdash;  even without further mass immigration (legal even more than illegal), we&rsquo;ll have a White minority by 2027 or so, that&rsquo;s already the case in the elementary schools! </p>
<p>Is there any other option for our future here, to preserve our people, any perhaps as-yet unconsidered (but realistic) path?  We have some quality discussion on these forums, but what, from a practical perspective, would be our legal and available options to stand up for our people?<br>

			<p>Even IF a lot of White voters went for Obama. It only meant one thing. That McCain, widely seen as simply a yes-man and stooge to Bush, was so despised EVEN OBAMA looked better.</p>
<p>I freakin love it when the media gushes about overcoming racism and similar drivel. The ONLY thing that got Obama in was that he ran against McCain. If the Stupidocrats only had sense enough to field a better choice as their candidate, obama would have lost big-time. But the mentally challenged, especially the Blacks, simply are too lost in their euphoria to understand that.</p>
<p>Wait four years&hellip; maybe even only two years. By which time Obama&rsquo;s halo has faded away. When Whites realize they sold themselves for a snake-oil sales pitch. </p>
<p>The reality is even Obama, the Magnificent, is not, cannot possibly be the miracle worker everyone now expects. Sure, he&rsquo;s lining up a support staff. But miracles take time&hellip; sometimes MORE than four years. Something a lot of Americans can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t understand. So look for a new White House occupant in January, 2013. (That is if the Mayan Calendar profphecy does not come to pass.)</p>
<p>The instant the Democratic controlled Congress senses the public turning against Obama, Congress will fall over its collective feet, distancing itself from Obama. But that&rsquo;s just American politics, folks. Nothing personal, right?</p>

			<p>It will be interesting to see what type of backlash there will be in two years.  My guess is that a lot of white liberals will sour to black / ethnic politics and come home.  Furthermore the exuberance of Obama will wear off and all the students and poor people will go back to doing what they always have done (nothing) and the turnout will drop way off.  I also think that the Republicans will start organizing once the shock has worn off starting with massive fund raising.  </p>

			<p>Interesting take. I could see this. I&rsquo;ve been hearing a lot about young voters loving Obama, and I&rsquo;ve seen evidence of it on television, but I haven&rsquo;t really met to many of them personally. I&rsquo;m in my twenties, and I don&rsquo;t support Obama. I know a lot of people in my age group who are what you might call left-leaning, and they didn&rsquo;t support Obama. In fact, some of the most liberal people I know didn&rsquo;t like Obama. The most common complaint I heard was that he seemed incredibly fake. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of people say that they hated his phony voice inflections that sounded like a cheap knock-off of a Dr. King Speech, or a sermon from a Black Church. Maybe there was a large enough combination of Blacks, Hispanics, and truly stupid people from both political isles of the White Race. Republicans like to call themselves the &#8220;Big Tent Party&#8221;, but in reality the Democrats are. This article indicates that 90% of McCain Supporters were White. For the last 40-50 years, the Democratic Party has been a large coalition of various factions that simply aren&rsquo;t big enough to constitute their own viable party. This is why Democrats tend to lose Presidential Elections. It&rsquo;s very hard to unify all those different people. Blacks, Hispanics, White Youth Voters, and Blue Collar Union Workers, and your four largest Democratic Voting Blocks, but each one has totally different objectives, and often times, the interests of one group is diametrically opposed to the interests of one or more of the others. Take &#8220;Amnesty for Illegals&#8221; (Hispanic Issue) vs. &#8220;Plunging Salaries &amp; Job Availability&#8221; (Blue Collar Issue). Take &#8220;Affirmative Action&#8221; (Black Issue) vs. &#8220;Limited Job and College Spaces&#8221; (White Youth Voters). Obama only won one of those groups completely, two if you count Hipanics, and he got just enough from the other groups to put him over the top.</p>

			<p>McCain like Bob Dole did not really want to become president.  He only wanted the honor and notariety.  He will now return to the US Senate as a hero of the Democrat Party.  The Democrats will stand and applaud McCain as he walks into the Senate Chamber.  McCain will become one of Obama&rsquo;s strongest supporters and will work with Democrats to get Amnesty and Tax Bills rushed through Congress.</p>

			<p>&#8220;90 percent of McCain&rsquo;s votes came from whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>This indeed starkly reveals the stupidity of so many of McCain&rsquo;s advisors. </p>
<p>It is these same neo-con advisors who despise Sara Palin and the fact that she stands for traditional Americans who denigrated her so severely by making silly outlandish claims that she didn&rsquo;t know Africa was a continent and not a country.</p>
<p>And it is this same bunch who prompted McCain to push for amnesty, stupidly believing he would win a large percentage of Hisanic votes, because his deision to run this time was made as soon as he lost out to the Bush earlier.</p>
<p>The neo-cons are out-of-touch with the real world, and if the Republicans don&rsquo;t eliminate them from their party they won&rsquo;t have a party pretty soon.</p>
<p>Sarah Palin is the future of the white people here.  She&rsquo;s not all we need, but she&rsquo;s closer than most.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t count on that, Hugo.  Liberalism is a mental disorder.  Their self flagellation is remarkable and seemingly limitless.  Remember- this has been going on for over 40 years and it gets worse every passing day.<br>

			<p>Yeah, right, believe in MSNBC doctored truth. They tell you the part of reality they want to, and hid the other part that they don&rsquo;t want you to know. It turns that it&rsquo;s enough to deceive most people.</p>
<p>If there were no young voters (now and in the last 40 years), the Democratic party wouldn&rsquo;t have entrenched itself in a position of power. And without that advantage, it would have slim chance to win this election.</p>
<p>If MSNBC is working hard to prove that young voters were not &#8220;essential&#8221; then, most likely, the converse must be true.<br>

			<p>So what? McCain lost, and he deserved to lose. If McCain had won he would do absolutely *NOTHING* to eliminate affirmative action or seriously stop illegal immigration. I don&rsquo;t feel one bit sorry for him. The Republican Party is a phoney opposition, taking the money, votes and hopes of White America while ignoring our racial or border concerns. Republicans are a an &#8220;empty suit&#8221;, full of lies, broken promises and false hope. I wish the Republican Party nothing but political oblivion.</p>

			<p>I am white, &amp; I voted for Obama because he is smart &amp; capable &amp; because McCain decidedly neither &amp; Palin even less so. </p>
<p>In some ways, I am to the right of McCain (immigration, quotas), in some to the left of Obama (national health care, robust unions for all workers who want them, severe punishment for corporate parasites, no compromise on the environment).</p>
<p>NB: Obama is not Muslin, not a leftist, is 50% WHITE, and was raised by his white relatives. </p>
<p>Like a lot of people these days, I am a firm believer in the core values of European civilization who is NEITHER LEFT NOR RIGHT in any traditional sense. </p>
<p>A lot of progressives (in Europe too) are saying privately that they feel &#8220;schizophrenic&#8221; because their views of immigration and race do not square with their other views.</p>
<p>I say it is not &#8220;schizophrenic,&#8221; but instead COHERENT. </p>
<p>Ideological packages are anathema to thought.</p>
<p>All that is lacking now is a forum for people like us in the North Atlantic Community of Europea &amp; North America. </p>
<p>Who knows? I may have to create it myself.</p>
<p>To reassure AMREN readers:</p>
<p>Obama will govern from the center, and will impress everyone with his skilful crisis management. He will bend over backwards not to seem excessively concerned with funneling resources toward blacks, and will not relax crime enforcement. </p>
<p>It may just take a PARTLY black president to dismantle or at least reform AA&hellip;.</p>

			<p>The servile African voting mass will be Obama`s first enemies. It is hard for an intelligent person to understand how somebody with an IQ of 80 thinks. I doubt if the law of supply and demand or Adam Smith`s Invisible Hand are discussed in the clubs at 2 a.m.<br>
     By Jan 21st 2009, when nobody has a new Escalade equipped with a blonde white woman chaueffer, trouble will start in the hood.<br>
     I have never met an African immigrant or progenny of same that did not hold African Americans in utter disdain. Unless Obama has the soul of the &#8221; Mahatma &#8220;he feels the same. He has relied on their gullibilty and hatred for his meteoric rise. He will be the first to throw their non-Ivy league behinds over board in his desire to do what all black folks desire to do, suck up to rich powerful white people.<br>

I&rsquo;m watching c-span as I write this and the guest is confirming what I suspected.</p>
<p>Tradition white communities had lower turnouts. I suspect these white communities didn&rsquo;t want to vote for a mulatto or puedo-republican &#8216;conservative&rsquo; and simply opted out of the election process.</p>

<p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s because there are less whites? What you say could be true, though. I did vote for Obama and wish him luck. But once I got in there though it was harder to vote for Obama and his &#8216;commie friends&rsquo; than I thought it was going to be.   </p>

			<p>If McCain had won he would do absolutely *NOTHING* to eliminate affirmative action or seriously stop illegal immigration.  The Republican Party is a phoney opposition, taking the money, votes and hopes of White America while ignoring our racial or border concerns. Republicans are a an &ldquo;empty suit&rdquo;, full of lies, broken promises and false hope. I wish the Republican Party nothing but political oblivion.<br>
___________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I agree the Republican party is terrible.  But what do we do about it?  I say let there be a leftist Democratic Party, a centrist Republican Party, and a right-wing Nationalist Party run for the benefit of White people.  Maybe we can&rsquo;t win 50% of the vote, but we can win 35%, and that is enough to put candidates in local, state, and federal office.  The Republican leaders will inevitably start trying to imitate the Democrats and &#8220;reach out&#8221; to their seperate interest groups, like Hispanics.  They move left and leave us the right-wing and all its issues - gun rights, anti-amnesty, anti-gay, anti-feminism, pro-Western civiliztion - that will get us at least a third of the electorate.  Let&rsquo;s stop complaining about Obama and do something.  Let&rsquo;s start a third party.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Is there any other option for our future here, to preserve our people, any perhaps as-yet unconsidered (but realistic) path? We have some quality discussion on these forums, but what, from a practical perspective, would be our legal and available options to stand up for our people?&#8221;</p>
<p>One option is separation, which means Civil War, because non-whites can&rsquo;t afford to let their white benefactors and taxpayers leave.  Another is to become the mecca for dispossessed whites from Europe, for those countries that are eventually abandoned to(or forever changed by) non-whites.  The exodus could end up being in our direction, rather than the other direction which you mention (which indeed is an option I am weighing for my old age).  With more white immigration, we might be able to strengthen certain stronghold areas.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem promising, however.  More realistically, we will have to collapse away fromm the coasts, and set up our own new nation, freed from the pathologies that non-whites bring.</p>

			<p>To elitist, who wrote:<br>
&#8220;I am white, &amp; I voted for Obama because he is smart &amp; capable &amp; because McCain decidedly neither &amp; Palin even less so. </p>
<p>In some ways, I am to the right of McCain (immigration, quotas), in some to the left of Obama (national health care, robust unions for all workers who want them, severe punishment for corporate parasites, no compromise on the environment).&#8221;</p>
<p>I take much the same view with regard to issues, though I did not actually vote for Obama.  </p>
<p>I also understand that non-whites vote according to racial interests, and whites do not, with the result that their dispossession is in full swing.  When people cite statistics about how a minority of citizens are funding the rest, this really means a mostly white productive population being drained of their money so that non-whites (blacks and Hispanics, at least) can have &#8220;access&#8221; to the things that whites built.</p>

			<p>  The Chicago media is already treating Obama as, not just the greatest president of all time, but the greatest man who ever lived.  The Chicago Tribune is unbelievably racist and biased. <br>
  I&rsquo;ve been talking to young whites.  They don&rsquo;t know anything.  Their education consists of hearing propaganda.  <br>
  One girl didn&rsquo;t even know what Affirmative Action was.  When I told her it was discrimination based on race she didn&rsquo;t believe me. When i asked her about Jena she thought a group of whites had attacked a black male.  They are totally ignorant.<br>
  Information, knowledge and reason are the enemies of the racists.  Give people facts.  Refer them to this excellent website.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Fight the Racists&#8221; brings up some good points. The average first or second time voter is too busy worrying about the antics of Hollywood bimbos like Brittny Spears or Paris Hilton than anything of substance in the news. Whether those same &#8220;young voters&#8221; actually have a clue regarding what&rsquo;s genuinely important or topical&hellip; I&rsquo;ll let you judge that one for yourself.</p>
<p>Granted, there are a handful of smart ones. But even those with more sense than stupefying themselves with alcohol or recreational drugs are miniscule in number. Thinking about how to buy that desired set of wheels weighs far more on young minds than the stories under newspaper headlines. </p>
<p>Add to the general unintelligence of young voters that incessant politically correct brainwashing received during eacg of their school years&hellip; you get the manipulated Obamabots who couldn&rsquo;t think for themselves if their lives dependet on it.</p>
<p>Whether Obama can be a good president. Can deliver on what was promised&hellip; remains to be seen. Predictably, if his popularity wanes, and it would not really take all that much&hellip; Obama may be a lame duck by his second or third year. Dumped like Jimmy Carter was at the end of his first term. Today the media hacks can&rsquo;t stop gushing over Obama, the Magnificent. Would anyone care to guess how soon the muckracking and probing replaces the mindless adulation in the media crowd?</p>

			<p>&#8220;The neo-cons are out-of-touch with the real world, and if the Republicans don&rsquo;t eliminate them from their party they won&rsquo;t have a party pretty soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right on.  I believe there&rsquo;s a segment of the Republican party that wants SOME conservatism, but they are insistant that it not include the God, mom, and apple pie segment.  In fact, their entire participation could very well be designed to break up the unified Reagan factions in order to seriously reduce the power of Republicans, because a unified Reagan party is one that can&rsquo;t be beaten even now with all the non-white rabble voting twice each.</p>
<p>In fact, now that I&rsquo;ve given the matter more thought, it certainly does appear as if those in the party denigrating Sarah saw it as a necessity, because the right was beginning to unify again even under a white-headed idiot saturated with so much do-gooderism that most everybody intensely disliked.</p>
<p>So, with the Reaganites again starting to circle the wagons the agents procateurs were near hysteria in trying to denigrate the one factor of McCain&rsquo;s campaign that was drawing huge crowds, which of course was Sarah.</p>
<p>I truly believe the anti-Reaganites effectively infiltrated the Bush administration pushing for a war with Iraq, then Iran, and they also installed themselves in McCain&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>It certainly makes all the questionable things about McCain and Bush both understandable.</p>
<p>Remember Bush ran on a ticket of NOT being the world&rsquo;s policeman?  Well, that was before he picked his advisors.  Since then, he&rsquo;s stuck his nose in the business of every country in the world.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve found the answer to the ongoing decadence of the GOP.<br>

			<p>Elitest,</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama will govern from the center, and will impress everyone with his skilful crisis management&#8221;</p>
<p>You are fooling yourself, but not us.  </p>
<p>Obviously, you do not believe Obama&rsquo;s record (most liberal, left voting in the Senate), his own words on specific subjects from amnesty, to health care, to taxes, to even a National Security Force, and you are unafraid of his friends and mentors - racists like his spiritual mentor Wright and Communists like Ayers, Palmer and a slew of others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather fight Obama now than after 4 more years of weakening by McCain, but Obama will be a disaster for this country or at least attempt to be one.</p>
<p>As far as thinking that we will be skillful in crisis management.  I know you are not basing that on one single fact or observation.  This man has done nothing.</p>

			<p>If the republican controlled congress and presidency we had such a short time ago would have sent the damn illegals home with massive immigration reform the hispanic vote wouldn&rsquo;t even be a issue. Americans wanted it and the republicans didn&rsquo;t deliver.</p>

<p>Exactly!  This elitist on the board and those other White fools voted for a Hollywood created image with no substance.  I suspect some liberals voted for Obama because they live in close proximity to blacks and other minorities.  Those threatening overtones in the MSM about race riots if Obama loses weren&rsquo;t directed at conservatives.     <br>

			<p>Whether Obama will do much good is an open question. Considering some of his choices for advisors&hellip; &#8220;unlikely&#8221; is probably a good answer.</p>
<p>To be sure we can hardly blame today&rsquo;s mess entirely on EITHER political party, much less on Obama. But with their clear majority in Congress, the Democrats are now in a highly uncomfortable position. That they HAVE TO PRODUCE (the right answers). If they, and their current darling, Obama CAN&rsquo;T, the 2006 picture will be rerun. With many of those up for re-election in 2006 falling by the wayside. </p>
<p>People did not as much vote FOR OBAMA, as they did against McCain/Palin! McCain perceived a doddering, bumbling old fool. Palin, inexperienced, not very bright. Saddled with tons of bad baggage.</p>
<p>No, not too many were intimidated by the threat of possible rioting. People just had more than enough of Bush&rsquo;s utter incompetence, his failed policies which contributed heavily to today&rsquo;s economic woes. Republicans really LOST the election when McCain accepted the Republican nomination. Given even too many Republicans privately saw him as an incompetent, inept buffoon. A man who who also did not espouse what many of us want. McCain a man, also lacked substance and credibility. Who&rsquo;s vaunted war record is certainly open to question, if not seen with a severely jaundiced eye. Do some googling, read for yourself what those who knew him wrote.</p>
<p>But today is still only today. This date two years down the road very probably will be a totally different picture.</p>

			<p>We are talking 6% of the popular vote here.  A 3% swing would have given it to McCain.  Not sure if the same was true of Electoral College votes, as Obama seems to have cleaned up many states more than the popular vote would indicate.</p>
<p>If Republicans had stuck to their guns and opposed the bailout, McCain may have won instead.  </p>
<p>It is also amazing that it was so close considering how lousy the Republicans were, and how one-sided the media was in reporting the Election.</p>
<p>I note that the DOW is still sliding after the Obama win.  All that bailout cash will be wiped out before Obama sits himself in the White House chair.</p>
<p>Karl Denninger predicted that the bailout only bought the economy six months before the inevitable correction occurred.  With a rampant Socialist as President Elect, I reckon the economy will be cooked before the Thanksgiving Turkey.</p>
<p>If Obama was wight, the media would have torn him limb from limb.  Rev. Wright, Bill Ayers, Muslim history, &#8216;spreading the wealth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The best dirt they had on the right was Palin&rsquo;s wardrobe! </p>
<p>Insane.</p>
