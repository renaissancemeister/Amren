<h1>&ldquo;Black Panthers&rdquo; Intimidate Voters in Philadelphia</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Whittington, Associated Content, Nov. 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Things got a little tense in Pennsylvania when two men dressed as Black Panthers stationed themselves outside a Philadelphia polling place. One of the so-called Black Panthers was brandishing a nightstick.</p>
<p>According to one bystander, a Republican poll observer, interviewed by Fox News, the &ldquo;Black Panthers&rdquo; made their intentions very clear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got a phone call that there was intimidation going on. I walked up to the door, two gentlemen in Black Panther garb, one brandishing a nightstick, standing in front of the door. They closed ranks as I walked up. I am a veteran; that does not scare me. I went inside and found poll-watchers, they said they had been here for an hour &mdash; I went inside and found poll-watchers, they said that they had said not to let people outside because black people are going to win no matter what. At that point, I spoke to him, we would not get into a fistfight, I said, and I called the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police arrived and escorted the &ldquo;Black Panther&rdquo; with the nightstick off the premises.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is unknown at this time if the two men with the nightstick outside the Philadelphia polling place, were actually Black Panthers of some sort or were just wearing the garb to be intimidating. Nor is it known on whose behalf, if anyone, they had stationed themselves outside the polling place.</p>
<p>This sort of voter intimidation demonstrates that, no matter what happens and whatever the polls say, Pennsylvania is more in play than the media suggests. Both John McCain and Barack Obama have visited Pennsylvania in the closing days of the Presidential campaign. A McCain win in Pennsylvania would complicate, if not outright short circuit, Barack Obama&rsquo;s quest for the Presidency.</p>

		<p>Wow, I thought that the blacks were concerned with voter intimidation by the police.  Perhaps they said that in order to keep the police away so that they themselves could do the intimidating?</p>

		<p>     You would think that there would have been police officers there anyway. Well, what can you expect from cities like Philadelphia ? My grandfather died in 1937, but I&rsquo;ll betcha he voted at least three times for Obama today.</p>

		<p>The reason the news media even showed up at the polls with the black panthers is because some brave University of Penn students went over and confronted these thugs who said that they were security. <br>
If it wasnt for these brave students, the media wouldnt have showed up.</p>

		<p>Obama has won the Presidency.  In the same year the federal government will have its first one trillion dollar deficit.  I&rsquo;m sure his solution to our fiscal problems will be to spend more money on blacks, illegal immigrants, welfare recipients, and foreign aid to Africa.</p>
<p>I have to blame white Republicans for this.  They could have chosen Ron Paul, who would have made this election a real contest: constitutional government vs. socialism and the nanny state.  Instead they picked an unpalatable half senile clone of George W. Bush, a man whose approval ratings are around 20%.</p>

		<p>People. BO has got in. There is nothing we can do right now and I would hope we don&rsquo;t got the route several skin heads were &#8220;accused&#8221; of.</p>
<p>I would hope that know we all start finding common ground amongst ourselves and put in someone who is for us. We need to stop being so seperated between abortion, war, and what not. This how they won, they put all those issues to the side and voted in someone who looked like them. Well, we can do the same.</p>
<p>If you are white and reading this: stop trying to find the religous nut conservative, they are the ones who killed us this time around. Many of them refused to vote.</p>
<p>Valhalla says its time to take a stand, well, before we do that, we got a lot of work to do. We need to re-gain control of the entertainment industry, sports, music and start making allies with others who feel the same as we do. For example, whites and Asians should really be getting along great, instead they were played to run to the black candidate.<br>
Our Spanish speaking whites, they have been forced to run amok with their non-white. We need to let them in. We need to stop trying to be good Christians and ally ourselves with Jews too. They are just as concerned about obama as we are.<br>
We need to form more groups, organize events that celebrate our history and do that with the non-blacks no matter that they may look like. Blacks now have the top spot, but they didn&rsquo;t get there alone, they got their with the help of the Hispanics, who many of them are just as white as us, they got there by pandering to the Jews and East Asians.<br>
We need to take a stand, but we need to make quite a many changes before that and the above are just a few of my suggestions.</p>

		<p>You people are unbelievable! Stop ye doubting Thomases!<br>
Don&rsquo;t you know that starting this morning 5 November every black American will have begun his/her epiphany? In the schools black students will stop wandering the halls all day, they&rsquo;ll be in class listening attentively to their teachers and studying hard. Sex, both consentual and forcible in the stairways will cease. Assaults on teachers and White students will cease.<br>
 On the streets crack sales will plummet, gang rape, murder and assorted mayhem will be only a memory. The Bloods, Crips, Gangsta Disciples,the Zulu Nation et al. will be disbanded and all their members will be attending evening adult education classes in order to prepare for the SATs and later, the GREs. LSATS and MCATS. Marriage and stable family life will become the norm in the Neighborhoods and peace and harmony will reign per omnia saecula saeculorum. AMEN.</p>
<p>O ye of little faith! Let not thy hearts be troubled! Haec est Diae qui fecit Barack. Alleluia, Alleluia!<br>

		<p>There was a nice white man at my local precinct polling place yesterday and I overhead him tell another man that he was tapped as &#8220;sheriff&#8221; for the day for the express purposes of making sure that everyone had free access to vote.</p>
<p>That is how it is done.</p>
<p>He said he didn&rsquo;t carry a gun (none like him did) because it was considered threatening and intimidating.</p>
<p>Of, course, that is the only decent thing to do.</p>
<p>Oh yeah. All the people in line with me were white rural folks who are outnumbered by a large hispanic community here which developed from migrant farm workers.</p>
<p>There were two signs posted, saying &#8220;we speak Spanish&#8221; (in both languages). But I didn&rsquo;t see any hispanics in line.</p>

		<p>It is indeed true that we have even more black crime to look forward to, as Obama defended the L.A. rioters and the Jena 6. He is a traitor to his white heritage, and all whites who voted for him are even worse than he is. I am at a loss to understand ho any white could commit such an act, yet I know some of my own family did. I was really angry at about midnight yesterday/today, as McCain conceded and the election was decided. </p>

		<p>I understand Cindy&rsquo;s anger; mine is a result of what could have been. Had Ron Paul won the GOP nomination, Obama would have been lucky to carry 10 states. His odyssey proves that we live under a 1-party socialist dictatorship with two branches (fascist and Marxist) that only pretend to oppose each other. The MSM are also complicit in this system.</p>
<p>Still, I always try to look at the bright side. I estimate we&rsquo;re now where the USSR was in 1989 or 1990. Therefore it will be Obama who goes down in history as the <i>last</i> US president once the government implodes around him. Then the legions of blacks who elected him will turn on him with a vengeance as their welfare checks bounce, their food stamps &amp; other handouts stop arriving altogether, and/or their do-nothing affirmative-action sinecures vanish.</p>
<p>Another bright side: Several news reports have revealed that gun sales nationwide have skyrocketed the last few months.(Include me in that statistic.) When the above scenario unfolds, many more whites will be ready, willing &amp; able to respond with overwhelming force.</p>

		<p>It is my fervent hope that these black retards continue with business as usual, only expanding their activities a bit more.</p>
<p>I saw the video clip of this incident.  They were telling people that white supremacy is over, advocating voting for the black.  All that these kinds of dumb tactics reveal is just more of same lack of intelligence by our enemy.  What nitwit really believes such tactics will do anything but defeat his cause and very likely get himself jailed, injured or killed in the process?  It is only the black nitwit of course.  </p>
<p>Every serious guerilla movement in the world would never consider these kinds of childish ploys.  It is bold actions that sway opinion, not inane bluster that obviously is of no real threat to anybody.</p>
<p>It is no wonder they believe this black president is going to install them in positions of power and that they will now be able to advance to any position they want and that all their failures to date have been due to whites instead of their own inability, because they are part of the vast majority of minions that can&rsquo;t succeed due to their inabilities, the same ones the good Jeremiah Wright and the Obamanation claims have been &#8220;held back,&#8221; due to racism and oppression, and because of this lack they don&rsquo;t have the intellect to be able to discern a situation beyond the realm of fantasy.</p>
<p>With the installation of socialism lite, black positions overall will improve monetarily under the Obamanation to some extent, but not enough to change the black image of abject failure, but there&rsquo;s also a very good chance that blacks will fare worse if the economy continues sliding downward or stays the same.</p>
<p>Of course, there is the dark, looming possibility of a depression which will make this black miscreant an icon of disgust if his economic policies make conditions worse by his pro-black agenda.<br>

		<p>Media have won an election and lost their honor.  Will they be able to keep the lid on black crime when, soon, every assault against whites will be seen as an act of calculated, political terror?  We all know that de facto segregation in blue-state America won&rsquo;t end and I see more racial rancor than ever ahead.</p>
<p>I spoke to my Doctor again today who told me that she had already discussed with her husband the prospect of going to half-days.  &#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to keep working this hard if the government is going to take seventy percent of it,&#8221; she said.  What will happen if white consumers, like the market, retrench and, in effect, boycott American business?  Obama&rsquo;s taxes will make companies less competitive overseas.  (Could we actually see protective tariffs?)  He won&rsquo;t forsake the left on drilling and nuclear.  The Fed can&rsquo;t lower interest rates anymore.  Look for the government to feverishly print a diurnal supply of new dollars.  And when that happens, it&rsquo;s keep your powder dry and thank goodness for peas and cornbread.</p>

Received this from paleoconservative email list:</p>
<p>McCain was terrible, a guest-worker amnesty loving neocon.  But make no mistake about it.  The victory of Obama in the recent election is nothing short of a declaration of war upon European Americans (i.e. whites).</p>
<p>This Cultural Marxist, Barack Hussein Obama, at one time or another has supported:</p>
<p>(1) Reparations.   Redistributing money from European Americans to blacks, mestizos, and Asians.</p>
<p>(2) Criminalizing white parents who refuse to let their children practice miscegenation.</p>
<p>(3) Using &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; to silence any criticism from European Americans.</p>
<p>(4) Using Third World immigration to overwhelm European American majorities.</p>
<p><br>
This is a sad day indeed.  Don&rsquo;t let the Cultural Marxists divide us.  Now, more than any time in American history, European Americans must stand together.  Our white brothers and sisters need us.</p>

		<p>So Obama won a decisive victory.  Wonder what will happen?  It might turn out like the worst President of the 20th century, Carter.</p>
<p>History certainly never repeats it&rsquo;s self exactly, but here are some parallels between now and the 1976 election.<br>
An out of nowhere, inexperienced Democratic candidate.</p>
<p>An angry public voting against an unpopular big government Republican president that isn&rsquo;t on the ballot.<br>
Years and years of inflammatory reporting against a Republican president by the MSM. (Sometimes I thing the real hatred of Bush from the left stems from them feeling threatened by his adoption of their big government style (kind of like Nixon).</p>
<p>The Republican candidate was previously seen as an &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; bi-partisan fellow.<br>
Winding down, but largely unpopular wars.<br>
Enormous political involvement by radical academia.<br>
Explosive growth of government during the approximately 10 to 15 previous years.<br>
Creeping tax growth.</p>

		<p>Democrat plan to increase electoral votes of big Democrat states.<br>
ACORN, not the census bureau will do the census.</p>
<p>Here is the scenario. Beginning in 2009, they will start planting articles in the media about how minorities have historically been intimidated by the census. They will interview people in black and Hispanic neighborhoods who explain they never trusted the government in the past. They were afraid their information would be used against them, especially if they had relatives of &#8220;intermediate&#8221; immigration status. </p>
<p>All that has changed now, will be the theme. The Obama administration is reaching out to everybody, every citizen, to be sure they are not disenfranchised. Huge grants will be given to ACORN-like groups to help educate and sensitize minority groups into the importance of participating in the census. </p>
<p>Another set of articles will appear, quizzing both census-takers and residents. They will be full of heart-warming stories of families who have been here for generations but only now are standing up to be counted. It feels good to sign up for the first time, now in the new America, the country that has matured and finally blossomed into a true land of opportunity.<br>

		<p>How Obama and ACORN won Ohio.</p>
<p>Hijinks Mar Ohio Vote<br>
And they don&rsquo;t even grow bananas in Cuyahoga County.</p>
<p>By Deroy Murdock</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ecuador has more voting integrity than we have here in East Cleveland today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is the considered opinion of a Republican attorney who is helping to monitor elections in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. He requested anonymity to avoid drawing attention to his employer. I have known him for years as an honest and very serious patriot and consider his comments reliable. He rang me to discuss the shenanigans that he and other Republican poll watchers have witnessed today in greater Cleveland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;GOP observers are calling in reports of multiple voting. People brazenly are coming in two or three times to vote,&rdquo; he said, the exhaustion clear in his voice. &ldquo;We may have an observer in one of every five or six precinct buildings, and they can see only so much. </p>
<p>People are coming in where there are multiple registrations for the same address. Someone might say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Troy Jones at 123 Main Street,&rsquo; and then he&rsquo;ll vote. Next, he will come back and say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Troy Jones, Jr. at 123 Main Street,&rsquo; then cast another ballot. Later on, a Troy Jones, Sr. registered at the same address gets to vote. This is why ACORN&rsquo;s multiple registrations are such a problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh well, less bloodshed than when Lenin took over Russia.</p>

		<p>More fraud and cheating in Ohio.</p>
<p>The attorney noted, &ldquo;People without proper ID are being allowed to vote. They are supposed to provide something like a utility bill. People who are not even properly registered to vote are being told, &lsquo;Yeah. Go ahead. That&rsquo;s close enough.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p>These voters, he added, then cast provisional ballots. These only are supposed to be counted if these voters later are deemed eligible to vote and correctly identified. Instead, the attorney says, &ldquo;These provisional ballots are being scanned in even before these people are judged as qualified or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had such reports at at least a half-dozen locations,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;We only know about this because there are Republican observers on hand. If they are doing this so brazenly where there are GOP observers in place, imagine what they are doing where there are no Republican observers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another irregularity, &ldquo;The Obama operation and the Democratic National Committee have tons of lawyers and tons of activists telling people how to vote,&rdquo; the attorney said. &ldquo;The generic instructions on &lsquo;using a paper ballot,&rsquo; say: &lsquo;When you are voting for Barack Obama, fill in the bubble beside his name only.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Campaign workers are distributing these inside the polling stations,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Precinct officials are allowing them to hand these out inside, rather than making them go beyond the 100-foot perimeter, past which they may conduct campaign activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Republican lawyer described a practice he called &ldquo;group voting,&rdquo; which obviates the idea of secret ballots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a while,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the poll workers were giving out clipboards with ballots on them. People were sitting together at tables, talking to each other, and looking at each other&rsquo;s ballots as they filled them out. At first, the County Board of Elections said this was OK. After receiving protests, they reversed their opinion and put a stop to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This attorney further complained, &ldquo;Republican lawyers are being surrounded, hounded, and harassed at some polling sites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observers with proper credentials are told their credentials are invalid because they lack an official seal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No official seal is required. We have filed protests and are documenting these abuses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This lawyer cited one colleague who is working with him on this effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One female lawyer told a local school board official who she knew that he had to step away from the polls because he was conducting electioneering right at the precinct door,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Within the hour, she received a call at her office, which was put through to her desktop voice mail. Someone who identified himself as a DNC lawyer said she would be investigated and prosecuted.&rdquo; </p>
<p>These are just a few weird scenes inside the gold mine that is vote-rich Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Let&rsquo;s hope the rest of today&rsquo;s nation-wide balloting is worthy of Earth&rsquo;s sole surviving superpower. <br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think whites got scared into voting for this quasi-Marxist.  The problem is that any presidential election in the US is really a referendum on the economy, and the economy currently stinks out loud.  The party occupying the White House is always the one to take the blame.  We had Republican fiscal conservatives running Congress for 6 years of Clinton&rsquo;s presidency, by Clinton got the credit.  We&rsquo;ve had Democrats running Congress for all of Shrubya&rsquo;s administration, but Shrubya gets the blame.  Voters are stupid, and seem not to realize that all spending bills originate in the House of Representatives. </p>
<p>The good news here is that Obama&rsquo;s picks for cabinet members are going to make Clinton&rsquo;s first cabinet look quite level-headed by comparison, with the predictable result that we&rsquo;ll see a 2010 Republican takeover of the House and Senate, just like we did in 1994.  That Obama&rsquo;s wife needs a nice tall glass of &#8220;shut up&#8221; just the way Shrillery did won&rsquo;t help them sell their planned &#8220;change&#8221;.</p>
<p>Shrillery Clinton has to be cursing this Obama victory.  The economy will remain soft, and she had to have been hoping McCain would end up stuck holding the bag.  Obama is now, but even then, he&rsquo;s just about automatically going to get the Democrat nomination in 2012; an incumbant president almost always does.  It means her chances at the White House even in 2012 are gone.</p>

Cindy, what is your source for the information that Obama supported the LA riots and the Jena 6?

		<p>Hey Tauras689 and TomIron,</p>
<p>Here in the Chicago area it&rsquo;s business as usual(Black Crime)<br>
Someone (the TV station did not say who or what) rammed a car<br>
into a shoe store and made off with some merchandise.<br>
Two guesses. </p>
<p>Also to 5:51</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; TT way to go.  Only include the CAPITALIST WAY<br>
OF LIFE.  Without it the very world that whites created would be<br>
very different.  I hear Barry is very anti-capitalist.<br>
Maybe we&rsquo;ll have 231,000,000 inflation here next year.</p>

<p>Strider:</p>
<p>My neighbors and I are already there.</p>
<p>I recently catered a small family gathering at my home  &mdash;  the caterers were Armenians, well known for dealing in a cash-based economy.  I yelled into the phone &#8220;I HAVE CASH&#8221;  &mdash;  and the owner immediately gave me a 20% discount on the spot. The food arrived quickly, beautifully done and with a few extras thrown in. I gave the owners a nice tip for such good service.</p>
<p>Later, my neighbor and I got together to hire a chimney sweep to clean out both of our chimneys  &mdash;  I asked the owner of the company if he accepted cash and he instantly said &#8220;Cash Is King!&#8221; and also offered us a discount.</p>
<p>Yes, I suspect a lot more of us will be dealing in a cash-based/bartering economy.  Here in California, Whites like me are sick of being taxed to death to support a growing, illegal, parasitic, government-favored underclass.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been advised to keep some cash around the house in case the banks close.</p>
<p>Yes, Cash is King.</p>

		<p>In the Book &#8220;Return of the King&#8221; evil Gollum briefly regained his Ring of Power.  He danced with joy over have reaquired his beloved ring.  He was dancing on the edge of a precipice that overlooked a lava pool.  In his exhuberance he lost his ballance and fell to his doom.  </p>
<p>So it was with Gollum and so it will be with America&rsquo;s blacks.  They will be emboldened to get in the face of whites and that will bring the chapter of blacks in America to a close.   <br>

 We&rsquo;re in a war for our country and the enemy&rsquo;s center of gravity is the mainstream media. We will contiue to lose as long fail to affect the MSM and fail to communicate with the majority of the country.<br>

<p>My wife gave her two weeks notice at work on Wednesday.  I already get enough welding work - usually for cash, that the three of us can afford to live on my income alone.  She simply wasn&rsquo;t interested in paying federal payroll taxes to a government run by a Socialist African, or contributing to the economy of a nation that would elect one.  </p>
<p>We do intend to apply for every form of government aid we can, however.  Let&rsquo;s see how easily the white-hating, America-hating idiot who sat through Reverend Wright&rsquo;s sermons for 20 years and only stopped once he was running for President can pay for his dreams of &#8220;change&#8221;, once the federal government is bankrupt.</p>

		<p>Fight the racists: it was indeed an AmRen article re the L.A. riots that stated Obama&rsquo;s position, plus if you google Obama and Jena 6, you will see the same attitude. I&rsquo;m sure you are not surprised. Good luck influencing liberals. My left-wing sister shrugged off Obama&rsquo;s soft stand on the actions of these black thugs and accused me of right-wing paranoia. I hope she and others in my family who no doubt betrayed our race are pleased.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;..Or any other people reading this. I would highly recommend reading the Lord of the Rings series. They are not only a prime work of fiction, but they describe so well the situation faced by whites in the west today. Tolkien denied some accusations made by critics that his works were &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; or something of that ilk. I&rsquo;ll leave that to the reader to decide. <br>
 <br>
If anyone here has read these books, I&rsquo;d be curious to hear what analogies you&rsquo;ve drawn between the characters/groups/races of the books and what exists in reality. <br>

<p>You&rsquo;re correct. My satirical post (further above) says it all. I think that a lot of Whites voted for Barack because they thought that he might be a role model to Black &#8220;youfs&#8221; since they are bereft of any at &#8220;home&#8221;. I for one am willing to adopt a &#8220;wait and see&#8221; attitude toward the situation. </p>
<p>On the day after the election two black thugs drove a car through the doors of a bank in S. New Jersey and made off with, at the time, an undisclosed amount of money. They also rammed their vehicle head on into a polioe cruiser injuring the officer and critically injuring the passenger suspect (no great tragedy). The driver ran off and has yet to be found. They obviously were oblivious to the great historical moment just the night before.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t make a prediction based on the aforementioned incident but will remain cautiously optimistic for at least two more weeks.<br>
