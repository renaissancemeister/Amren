			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nico Hines, Chris Smyth, Jenny Booth, Times of London, November 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police chiefs said tonight that they expect every force in the country to be scouring a leaked list of alleged BNP members that looks certain to cost at least one Merseyside officer his job.</p>
<p>Problems for the far-right party continued today after Rod Lucas, a radio DJ, and a policeman became the first victims of the breach of privacy that saw the names of thousands of BNP members published on the internet.</p>
<p>Officers in Liverpool referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission when they discovered the name of one of their officers on the membership list.</p>
<p>This afternoon the IPCC said it had no need to intervene and suggested that Merseyside Police act firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The national policies are clear that membership of the BNP is incompatible with the requirements of the role of a police officer and I know Merseyside Police will act robustly if necessary,&#8221; said Naseem Malik, IPCC Commissioner for the North West.</p>
<p>Decisive action is expected to be replicated across the country as individual forces face questions on the political affiliations of their officers.</p>
<p>The Association of Chief Police Officers has banned officers from joining the BNP and a spokesman said it was &#8220;highly likely&#8221; that forces all over the country would be scanning the list. Police are banned from becoming members of the BNP because it would damage race relations.</p>
<p>TalkSport radio said today that it had &#8220;no plans to use&#8221; Mr Lucas, a chat show presenter who covered late-night shifts for the station this year, after he was listed among more than 12,000 BNP supporters.</p>
<p>The presenter responded this afternoon by claiming that he had joined the party as an undercover journalist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am an investigative radio journalist and am a member of over 20 political parties and pressure groups,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do this for research, in order to come up with material from my show. In 2004 I did a series of shows on Fusion Radio in which I delved into the BNP.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have often mentioned on air my work on the BNP &mdash; it is certainly no dirty secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>His name and contact details were included alongside his profession: &#8220;media: radio/TV production&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Lucas, a Sony Award winner who once worked for Radio One, had eulogised on his website how much he had enjoyed working for his &#8220;favourite&#8221; radio station, but this morning TalkSport bosses were swift to distance themselves from him.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8220;We were not aware of his membership of the BNP until today. We have no plans to use Rod Lucas in the immediate future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The membership list was today removed from the original blog where it was published but remains available on other websites.</p>
<p>Nick Griffin, the BNP leader, said that the party would take court action against those responsible for the leak. Earlier this year the BNP said it had obtained an injunction at the High Court in Manchester, banning any publication of the list.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin said: &#8220;It was entirely wrongly used without authority by a very small group of previous party members who were expelled late last year who then passed it on, to who we simply don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&#8220;All we can say is that if we find out who it was and they are one of those covered by the High Court injunction, then they are going to prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin was forced to deny that BNP spokesman Simon Darby had intended to threaten violence when he told The Times last night that if the culprit was found, &#8220;it will turn out to be one of the most foolish things they have done in their life&#8221;, and that &#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t be sleeping very well tonight&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;There is no threat of violence as is being reported.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BNP said in a statement on its website that it had lodged a complaint with Dyfed-Powys Police on the grounds that the &#8220;disgraceful act of treachery&#8221; breached human rights and data protection laws.</p>
<p>Prison officers, like the police, are forbidden from joining the BNP but the leaked list appeared to include several prison staff.</p>
<p>A Prison Service spokesman, however, refused to confirm whether they were investigating the individuals included on the list.</p>
<p>Most other public sector professions including teachers, healthcare professionals and armed servicemen are not governed by similar bans but many workers now face questioning from colleagues and bosses over whether belonging to a party associated with racist views is compatible with the caring ethos and emphasis on equality in their work.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defence says that serving members of the Armed Forces who belong to the BNP are breaking no rules.</p>
<p>At least two dozen people serving in the Armed Forces are members of the BNP, according to the leaked list, with well over a hundred people listed as ex-servicemen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Individuals are free to join political parties but they are expected to abide by our values and standards in all they do,&#8221; an MoD spokesman said. There is known to be unease within the MoD about some BNP policies, which are believed to be incompatible with military values, but it has no plans to follow the police in establishing a formal ban.</p>
<p>One former soldier named on the list told The Times today that there were &#8220;a lot of serving BNP members in the British Army&#8221;. Keiron Le-Mar, who served in Iraq with the Somerset &amp; Cornwall Light Infantry, explained: &#8220;It&rsquo;s a party that thinks that England should be put first and when you join the British Army you&rsquo;re obviously a pretty patriotic person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Le-Mar said that he was open about his BNP membership for two years while in the Army, before leaving twelve months ago. None of his colleagues expressed any hostility towards his political allegiance, he said.</p>
<p>He said that he had not encountered any soldiers from ethnic minorities while in the Army but would have had no problem serving alongside them.</p>
<p>Other servicemen contacted refused to speak. One had set up his mobile phone voicemail to explain that he was not answering his mobile phone &#8220;probably because I don&rsquo;t want to speak to any choppers like yourself&#8221;.</p>
<p>Several BNP members give their addresses as Army barracks or RAF bases. There is no rule against this, and the MoD confirmed that there is nothing to stop servicemen or women receiving BNP literature through the post on base. They would be banned from distributing leaflets on service property, however.</p>
<p>Many people posting on the British Army&rsquo;s unofficial online forum appeared supportive of their BNP colleagues, before moderators deleted the entire thread, leading to accusations that the &#8220;thought police&#8221; were at work. That thread was also deleted.</p>
<p>The Department of Health has a similar policy in place with no action to be taken unless a member of staff&rsquo;s views affected their work or they were found to be abusing their position to recruit for the BNP.</p>
<p>Dee Lockhart, 44, a BNP member and a medical secretary from Cumbria, said that in six years working for the NHS she never encountered any problems when discussing her political beliefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s my feeling that you&rsquo;re supposed to have political freedom,&#8221; she told The Times today, explaining that she had retired from work last year after a road traffic accident.</p>
<p>The wife of one doctor on the list said that since his name had been published on the leaked list his life had become a misery.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband has been hounded and he&rsquo;s not even a member of the party,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is really hurting him. If there are any employment repercussions we will be seeing a solicitor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another care professional told The Times he was outraged that his name had been published. He claimed that he had done excellent work with young offenders in three years as a youth worker and said he did not feel his political views affected his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve worked well with children from all walks of life and this will definitely affect my chances of getting future jobs. It&rsquo;s sickening,&#8221; he said.<br>

								<h2><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/nov/19/thefarright-freedomofinformation">BNP List May Lead to Sackings</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Haroon Siddique, Guardian (Manchester), November 19, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The list of BNP members posted on the internet contains the details of people in a wide range of jobs. Some of them appear to have already been sacked while others&rsquo; jobs are said to be under threat.</p>
<p>The police have a ban on BNP membership that they say is based on their duty, as a public body, to promote equality under the Race Relations Amendment Act 2000.</p>
<p>But while all public bodies are subject to the act, most of them appear not to share the police view that &#8220;promoting equality&#8221; necessitates a ban on BNP membership (an action not explicitly endorsed in the act). Other public bodies believe that by ensuring employees do not practise discrimination in the workplace they are complying fully with provisions of the act.</p>
<p>Police</p>
<p>Merseyside Police has confirmed that it is investigating claims that a serving officer is a member of the British National party. The force&rsquo;s chief constable, Bernard Hogan-Howe, insisted that membership of the BNP was &#8220;totally incompatible with the duties and values of Merseyside police&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Association of Chief Police Officers said police were banned from becoming members of the BNP because it would damage race relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Membership or promotion of the BNP by any member of the police service, whether police officer or police staff, is prohibited,&#8221; said Acpo&rsquo;s workforce development spokesman, Peter Fahy.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is because such membership would be incompatible with our duty to promote equality under the Race Relations Amendment Act, and would damage the confidence of minority communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the policy may have been controversial at the time it was enacted in 2004, it has since been accepted by all staff and staff associations, and remains unchallenged thus far.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ban on BNP membership among police officers was enshrined in 2005 in an amendment to the Police Regulations 2003.</p>
<p>Prison officers</p>
<p>A prison service spokesman said it was the first public sector employer to ban staff from being members of racist organisations and had dismissed employees for such action in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prison service is very clear on this issue: we take allegations of racism very seriously and have a zero-tolerance policy of those who hold racist views,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When being recruited externally or applying for transfer or promotion, candidates are asked to state categorically that they do not belong to the BNP, National Front or Combat 18, or any other group or organisation promoting racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Membership of such organisations is entirely incompatible with working in the prison service and, if it is confirmed that a member of staff belongs to one of them, they will be subject to our disciplinary procedures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Church of England</p>
<p>Ben Wilson, a spokesman for the Church of England, which is not a public body under the Race Relations Amendment Act, said it had seen &#8220;no evidence&#8221; that any serving vicars were on the list, despite media reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;The church&rsquo;s General Synod passed a motion in 2004 stating that any political movement that seeks to divide our communities on the basis of ethnicity is an affront to the nature of God revealed in creation and scripture and is a grave danger to harmonious community relationships; consequently voting for and/or supporting a political party that offers racist policies is incompatible with Christian discipleship.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;It would be difficult to take any formal action against a vicar on the basis of their alleged membership of the BNP, as membership of any lawful political party is excluded from the grounds for complaint under the clergy discipline measure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Army</p>
<p>An MoD spokesman said: &#8220;Our position is that individuals are allowed to join political parties as long as they uphold our values and standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he and colleagues found the views of the BNP &#8220;abhorrent&#8221;, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Doctors</p>
<p>The General Medical Council, which regulates doctors in the UK, has a policy that upholds doctors&rsquo; rights to hold personal political beliefs.</p>
<p>But a spokeswoman said: &#8220;Doctors must not allow their own beliefs to compromise patient care &hellip; They can&rsquo;t allow their professional or political beliefs in a way that exposes the patient&rsquo;s vulnerabilities or causes distress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teachers</p>
<p>The General Teaching Council for England, which registers all state school teachers, was clear that BNP membership was no obstacle to registration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t have a policy that says that people within the teaching profession cannot be members of the BNP,&#8221; a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Malcolm Trobe, policy director of the Association of School and College Leaders, said teachers have a right to their own political views but said &#8220;extremist views might not fall in with the conduct expected of a teacher&#8221;. He pointed in particular to &#8220;core values&#8221; such as respect, equality and diversity.<br>

			<p>Well, maybe it&rsquo;s time for the BNP to assert itself in the courts and stop this discrimination. England, like the US, has given into terrorists and bigots who persecute others for their politics and thoughts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to swing the pendulum back to freedom.  This will only happen by standing up to the terrorists and bigots in government.</p>

			<p>Would it be beyond reason to see to it the some of the opponants of the BNP found their names on some disgraceful and leaked list? This is sort of like what happened in the U.S. with the McCarthy investigations/blacklisting sort of thing. I think this will be good for the BNP and publicity should bring increased membership. I see a muslim name in the forfront of the critics of BNP in the form of Naseem Malik!! diversity, gotta love it.</p>

<p>What difference should one&rsquo;s personal politics make when it comes to their job???? As long as the police officer is doing his(her) job correctly, it shoulnd&rsquo;t matter. In a free society, people have the right to their politics. Of course, is a society isn&rsquo;t free, then that&rsquo;s a different matter.</p>

			<p>Britain is now approaching the former Soviet Union in the extent of political oppression.  In today&rsquo;s Britain simply being a member of a political party that wants to limit immigration makes one vulnerable for persecution from the state????</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Britons are now slaves in their own nation.  And considering the president we just elected America is not far behind.</p>
<p>In the past fifty years the left having failed to bring about communism in the Western nations using class warfare has substituted racial/ethnic/demographic warfare to achieve their goals.  Therefore, the left desires more immigration at all costs and will crush anyone who gets in their way.</p>

			<p>Man, oh man. Just when I thought things couldn&rsquo;t get more ridiculous in Great Britain, people are being fired from their jobs and persecuted for their party affiliation? I&rsquo;d expect something like this from Castro&rsquo;s Cuba, or Argentina&rsquo;s Peron (when he ruled), but Britain, supposedly the vanguard of European democracy?</p>
<p>After this, the British have ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT to point fingers at any other country on Earth.</p>

			<p>Unless there is a serious revolution in England, the numbers game will be won by the foreigners.</p>
<p>Democratic process as the BNP is attempting to follow will unfortunately not work.</p>
<p>It is not a level playing field.  The scales are tipped in favor of the foreigners.</p>

<p>WHAT A DISGRACE!   </p>
<p>Even though being aware of how pathetically sick modern Britain has become, I am still appalled.  </p>
<p>Is this why they fought &#8220;Totalitariamnism&#8221; in the 1940s?  Is this why they resisted the Iron Curtain throughout the Cold War?  For what?   And now they have the disease!  They have exactly what they thought they were defeating.  And all in the name of  &#8220;freedom&#8221; and &#8220;democracy&#8221;!  Is this freedom?   What a terrible, vicious joke has been played on them.</p>
<p>But to take it further &hellip;.  how long will it be before the same creeping totalitarianism overtakes us?   Now that we have the  (unrepentant) Bernadine Dorhn/Weatherman crowd installed in the White House and pulling the strings behind the scenes, this  <br>
becomes a distressingly urgent question. I fear that the gullible American people,in their starry-eyed  moment of euphoria, have elected a pig in a poke.  They didn&rsquo;t know what they were getting. (No more so than the British people ever did.)</p>
<p>Well, we shall be finding out. And I&rsquo;m afraid it will look like Britain.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Police chiefs said tonight that they expect every force in the country to be scouring a leaked list of alleged BNP members that looks certain to cost at least one Merseyside officer his job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t this be using illegally obtained information? And hence, any action taken upon such evidence would be equally illegal and invalid?</p>
<p>Of course, this does not even address the &#8220;illegality&#8221; of membership in a disliked political party anyway. Since when is membership in an unpopular party, or holding unorthodox political views, considered illegal?   Has the BNP been outlawed in Britain?  Have disapproved opinions been legally banned?  Not that I&rsquo;m aware. Not yet!  But you would certainly think so.</p>
<p>Is Britain reverting to the 1500s and the reign of Bloody Mary?<br>
Or the 1600s and the dictatorship of Cromwell?  Have they learned nothing from their history?  The only dissimilarity is that now the bones of contention are secular, not theological.   Small difference!   </p>
<p>Very small indeed to the heretics who are persecuted.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the BNP?&rsquo; In order to apply for a job, keep your job or expect promotion, you must prove you are a fully paid-up member of the Labour Party. Serving in HM forces is, of course, proof of Britishness and loyalty to Queen and Country. The BNP supported others who petitioned this scottish communist government to grant citizenship to Gurkhas who had also served in the British forces for over a century unlike the pakistani hordes who pour into UK every year with the full blessing of the labour party. Every single mouthpiece appearing on UK T/V to vilify the BNP is openly a labour party member or union member supporting the labour party. The BNP is a legally registered political party with members serving on many local councils. BNP members obviously do not vote labour but muslims do, although not individually, as they are told to follow allah&rsquo;s law and not the laws made by man, so the local mosque collects the postal ballots and completes them as they see fit. If only voters in local elections would vote BNP instead of supporting this corrupt labour gang it would show what Britishness really means and we can start to recover England for England and Englishmen. </p>

			<p>&#8220;In the past fifty years the left having failed to bring about communism in the Western nations using class warfare has substituted racial/ethnic/demographic warfare to achieve their goals. <br>
Therefore, the Left desires more immigration at all costs and will crush anyone who gets in their way.&#8221;<br>

Correct.  And the sappy, greedy business interests of the Right   &mdash;   in their quest for higher profits and cheaper labor   &mdash;    very willingly cooperate in this demographic assault upon the nation.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Gay Conservative&rsquo; posting at 9.20 AM November 20. It&rsquo;s not illegal to be a member of any registered political party but the labour party is funded mainly by unions who impose a political levy on all their members. The individual amounts are quite small but millions of members pay weekly into union coffers which is then &#8216;donated&rsquo; to the labour party in huge tranches. There is no way to trace individual union contributions against a labour membership list and so this is kept secret. Unions and labour alike love this secrecy of non-accountability and please note how the prison officers union, the teachers union and others just lap up this whole BNP &#8216;threat&rsquo;. I note that the police officers deliberately ommited any mention of the &#8216;Black Police Officers Association&rsquo; in all this, too close to home I suspect as very senior police officers are not White and some are muslim. The labour party have just had a hand in revealing BNP membership who do not enjoy this legally sanctioned secrecy because two and a half million muslim votes in labour held local elections are far more important than any idea of maintaining English democratic values for a few thousand non-labour votors. It is also in these same local areas where the BNP enjoy the strongest support from the White English electorate who have seen, first hand, the gradual erosion of their lives, neighbourhoods and culture due to the continual immigration of pakistanis and other aliens. This labour policy cannot be criticised as is under the protection of the race relations act and many White English individuals, especially BNP members, have been prosecuted for expressing their concern. The prosecution lawyers are always non-white liberals appointed by labour and paid for by the state. There is no need to actually join the BNP, but votes supporting their candidates wherever they stand for election against labour will have the same effect because labour has yet to find a legal way of tracing secret ballot papers. This is not a general election involving international relations with russia or why the EU insist on our fishermen dumping perfectly good fish overboard because labour are too weak to challenge such stupidity, but very much a home issue right on the doorstep of every good true Englishman.</p>

			<p>&gt;&ldquo;This is because such membership would be incompatible with our<br>
&gt;duty to promote equality under the Race Relations Amendment<br>
&gt;Act, and would damage the confidence of minority communities.</p>
<p>So legislation specifically bans membership of a certain<br>
political party. Why do they not ban all membership of all<br>
political parties? I find this whole mess very undemocratic.</p>
<p>&gt;But he and colleagues found the views of the BNP &ldquo;abhorrent&rdquo;,<br>
&gt;the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Is this journalism or propaganda?</p>

			<p>THIS MAY BE WHY TO POLITICIANS ARE SO ANTI BNP</p>
<p><br>
A packed inaugural BNP group meeting at a central Leigh venue was shocked to hear of how Somali immigrants are milking the system with multiple identity fraud schemes.</p>
<p>Activist Dr Paul Rimmer explained how immigrants were able to claim multiple benefits under fictitious names using different benefit offices which were unable to cross check their validity.<br>

<p>This strikes me as remarkably similar to Saudi Arabia or Iran, or any &#8220;Islamic republic&#8221;,  where it would  be legally forbidden and very dangerous to question a single verse of the Koran.</p>
<p>Depending on the country and culture, some things cannot be questioned. They  simply MUST be believed, and doubters are punished severely.  Nearly every religion tries, at least when it gets sufficient power, to place its  basic tenets beyond the pale of  doubt or discussion.  Unquestioning belief is mandated.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s obvious that the rabid new cult of Diversity has taken on  a kind of religious aura which places it above and  beyond the pale.   As in any totalitarian theocracy, questioning is forbidden, doubting is a sin, and heretics  are punished.   Multiculturalism and immigration are basic tenets of that cult. There is something fanatical about it. Unfortunately,  it has become the new state religion of Britain.  </p>
<p>Like some infectious disease, the cult of Diversity is spreading all over Europe and to many other countries. It is a new &#8220;plague&#8221;, a disease of the mind. A mass psychosis. Those infected by it should be quarantined to protect those who are still sane and rational!</p>

			<p>      This is the kind of thing that Joe McCarthy fought against.<br>
If he had succeeded in routing out the Communists in high places<br>
we would have a much better country today. As it is, He, the <br>
John Birch Society, etc fought a good rear guard action that was<br>
doomed to fail. Why? Because it was engineered from the Top. But<br>
they did slow them down considerably. We owe Him and Them a debt<br>
of gratitude. Instead, We-his heirs, slander him with the leftist<br>
word, &#8220;McCarthyism&#8221;. If we get into power, we have every right<br>
to throw traitors out of power, or out of the country, or into<br>
prison. How can anyone confuse right and<br>
wrong in this way? Are we the same as them? Just because we do <br>
some of the same things like eat, breathe, talk, and throw people<br>
out of office? Motive is the difference not neccesarily outward<br>
action although we will use legal channels when available which<br>
they usually ignore or distort.</p>

			<p>It is absolutely disgusting that such vile suppression of opinion can be conducted in broad daylight in the land of the Magna Carta.  Every freedom-loving White person in Britain should search out opportunities to financially support the people who show up on that list.  Use the BNP mechanic, doctor, or chemist - and help shove a thumb into the eye of tyranny.</p>

The strangest part about this circumstance is that it has provoked a &#8216;WITCH-HUNT&rsquo; in the truest sense of the word.<br>
.<br>
How is this so, you may ask?<br>
.<br>
A certain British Police Force in the North West - probably the 2nd largest in the country? - has recently dismissed one of its &#8216;New&rsquo; Trainers for an apparent interest in a topic that would possibly make extremists rush for their &#8216;Tapers&rsquo; and &#8216;Bundles of Faggots&rsquo;?<br>
.<br>
Not too sure what that could be?<br>
.<br>
The Trainer in question has an interest in whether or not the Police would use a Psychic.   He has a Masters Degree in Criminal Justice and I beleive is enrolling on a PhD programme.<br>
.<br>
In the letter of dismissal (dated 24th October) the wording is: &#8220;&hellip;information has come to light regarding previous work with Neighbouring Forces and your current work in the psychic field which is not compatible with employment in ***&#8221;.<br>
.<br>
A &#8216;Freedom of Information&rsquo; request, asking if anyone from that Police Force has been dismissed because of &#8220;work in the psychic field&#8221; (whatever that is) should prove both interesting and enlightening?<br>
.<br>
What do you think about that!<br>
.<br>
I know that this sounds unbelievable in this age of Tolerance; Diversity; and Acceptance, but believe me, this is a true happening.   Check it out!<br>
