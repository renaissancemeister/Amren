<h1>Border Patrol Says Fence Slows Attacks on Agents</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elliot Spagat, AP, November 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Border Patrol has finished installing razor-sharp barbed wire atop a 5-mile stretch of fence on the Mexican border, an addition critics call heavy-handed and an eyesore.</p>
<p>Agents say the concertino wire on a violent stretch separating San Diego from Tijuana, Mexico, has already contributed to a sharp drop in attacks by assailants hurling rocks, bricks and sometimes even exploding bottles of gas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Without the wire, migrants could jump the fence in only 15 seconds. But it now takes several minutes for them to cut a hole in the fence using handheld, battery-powered saws, Corley said.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s consul general in San Diego, Remedios Gomez Arnau, said efforts by Mexican authorities to prevent attacks on border agents may explain the drop in violence, not the razor wire. She said the Border Patrol rejected her plea to reconsider installing the wiring.</p>
<p>The 5-mile stretch is the only place on the U.S.-Mexico border with razor wiring on top of the fence, and there are no plans to use it elsewhere, said Border Patrol spokesman Lloyd Easterling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The counterattacks have diminished, according to the Border Patrol, as the more formidable fencing appears to have pushed border crossers elsewhere, heralding a welcome calm for many who live in the shanties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many [attacks on border agents] occurred in the San Diego area, but the Border Patrol said attacks dropped in the 5-mile stretch where the razor-wire was installed. It counted 90 attacks on agents in the 11 months after installation began Dec. 17, compared to 184 in the preceding 11 months.</p>
<p>Apprehensions in the 5-mile stretch dropped 53 percent during that time to 3,746 from 7,989, the Border Patrol said. Corley said the fencing has pushed migrants west toward the Pacific Ocean &mdash; and resulted in more attacks against agents in that area.</p>

<p>Just like those stellar Mexican &#8220;authorities&#8221; are preventing murder, violence and corruption.</p>
<p>The razor wire fence is a good first step, but the next step is to end the BP-hating in the US Justice Department, brought to you by people like Johnny Suttonfong, President Bush and President-Select Barack Obama.  Otherwise, BP agents who do their jobs will wind up in Federal prison.</p>

Well, any attempts by the US to control it&rsquo;s side of the border is characterized as &#8220;heavy-handed&#8221; by the illegal invader enablers. And it&rsquo;s just an absolute joke to listen to the Mexican government trying to take credit for this. They do absolutely nothing to help stabilize the out-of-control border situation from their side. In fact, they actively attempt to hinder any attempts to get this situation under control. So, I have no doubt who the &#8220;critics&#8221; are in this situation. </p>

			<p>When politics gets in the way, effective action is far away.</p>
<p>Imagine a much bigger fence, and more patrols, especially ones that put detainees in uncomfortable (not inhumane) surroundings.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking dirt-poor people and putting them in air conditioned jails. Not much incentive to avoid it, is there?</p>

			<p>this is why when people are serious about a fence they put up double rows.  Not only does it take more time to get over the second fence but the illegals are effectivly trapped inbetween for a while.  put a road down the middle with paddy wagons and scoop em up, finger print em, digitize their mugs and send em back to meheeko.  </p>

Fences work. Look to the Chinese. They learned that lesson millennia ago and they&rsquo;re still largely intact as a unified nation. Britain had the natural barrier of the English Channel. </p>
<p>Fences have gotten a bad rap by the people who vilify everything they don&rsquo;t like.</p>

			<p>I suggested this over a year ago!  When I was in federal prison, we had a regular chain-link fence topped with razor wire, and another one just like it ten feet outside it.  In between, there was a 3 X 3 stack of more razor concertina wire, so maybe 10 feet high and ten feet thick.  Nobody even thought about trying to escape through that stuff.</p>
<p>The answer to the handheld, battery-powered saws, is of course land mines, which I also suggested over a year ago.  One &#8220;Bouncing Betty&#8221; would work wonders, but for real fun, two anti-tank mines buried in a stack under an anti-personnel mine is hard to beat.  The AP mine sets off the AT mines.  Blasting a few &#8220;coyotes&#8221; into a red mist would discourage the others, I imagine.</p>

			<p>I went to the Arizona border this spring with the Minutemen.  We got a tour of the border.  Fences ranged from non-existant, to laughable, to pretty good.  But even the pretty good fences were easily scaleable without wire on the top.  I saw a young, fit Mexican scale one of the betert fence designs faster than I could focus my camera.  </p>
<p>The &#8220;fences&#8221; erected by Air National Guard units out of old pre-fab landing strip steel (Bush&rsquo;s PR stunt) looked like they had been designed by Mexicans to provide optimum cover &amp; handholds!</p>
<p>My &#8220;takeaway&#8221; was that it is quite possible to build sturdy, tall, see-through fences out of vertical, concrete-filled steel pipe, topped with razor wire, that would make it significantly more difficult to cross the border.  Such low-tech fences would not solve the problem 100%, but like simply locking your windows &amp; doors at night it would keep out the majority of the criminals.  With the amateurs kept out, BP could concentrate on the more sophisticated attempts.</p>

<p>The only possible reason Remedios Gomez Arnau could have for objecting to the razor wire is that she wants the invasion to continue.  No surprise.</p>

			<p>Some years ago I was talking with a guy about his country.  He said they had laws against police brutality.  But if it involved their national security, there was no such thing as police brutality&hellip;they could be as brutal as they wanted or needed to be.  The law made that exception.</p>
<p>That said, it appears that foreign invasion under Jorge Bush doesn&rsquo;t meet the definition of national security.  The BP has to make nice and ask permission first before they arrest someone.  Mustn&rsquo;t hurt their feelings.</p>
