			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sandy Banks, Los Angeles Times, November 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Alliance of White Anti-Racists Everywhere was fired up at its conference in downtown Los Angeles last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reject the Hate in &rsquo;08&#8221; was their rally cry at the UCLA Downtown Labor Center near MacArthur Park.</p>
<p>&#8220;White privilege,&#8221; one speaker said, &#8220;is the enemy of equality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to maintain our activism,&#8221; warned another, &#8220;and not let whiteness overtake us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd &mdash; mostly young and white, with a hippie vibe &mdash; applauded as the small corps of self-described &#8220;anti-racist whites&#8221; tried to introduce them to their hidden racist ways. The peasant skirts, political T-shirts and revolutionary cries made me feel like I&rsquo;d wandered back in time, into a radical chic salon.</p>
<p>But I clapped too, because it was nice to hear white people talk publicly, bluntly, about race. And not pretend to be colorblind.</p>
<p><b>Where whites get real about race</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Monday, I interviewed Clare Fox, an urban planning student at UCLA who spoke at the meeting. Her talk about whites&rsquo; responsibility to challenge racism had struck a chord in me. For too long, minorities have done the heavy-lifting &mdash; explaining, excusing, fuming silently.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When she returned to Los Angeles, the Alliance of White Anti-Racists Everywhere gave her a framework for her new sensitivities. The local chapter of the national organization was created five years ago &#8220;to create a space for anti-racist white people to talk openly and honestly about the role of whiteness and race in our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, at weekend anti-racism classes, Fox helps other whites get in touch with the notion of white privilege &mdash; the concept that whites still benefit in &#8220;invisible&#8221; ways in a country that once enslaved blacks and enshrined white supremacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have homework assignments,&#8221; Fox said. &#8220;Like at least once a day, use &lsquo;white&rsquo; as a descriptor for somebody. You discover how odd that sounds &mdash; &lsquo;the white professor&rsquo; or &lsquo;the white guy in the lobby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;White kids born and raised post-civil rights associate &lsquo;white&rsquo; with being bad and racist,&#8221; Fox told me. When she tried using MySpace for outreach, she got a message from an old friend &mdash; &#8221;Irish, white as they come&#8221; &mdash; who said &#8220;I really don&rsquo;t appreciate being called white.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s about newspaper headlines that say &lsquo;Barack Obama&rsquo;s Race Problem,&rsquo; like it&rsquo;s something he&rsquo;s supposed to solve. It&rsquo;s not his problem. It&rsquo;s all of ours.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dogged by race</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to tie yourself in knots pondering the impact of race. And some of what I heard at the anti-racism rally made me wonder if getting beyond race is possible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I think the concept of white privilege is real. Even Obama himself alluded to it, in my interview with him three years ago. &#8220;If you ask people of all races, &lsquo;Is it tougher being black than white?,&rsquo; I think white people know the answer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;whether you ask in Utah or in Chicago or in Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>

		<p>White Skin privilidge, if it really does exist, does not require the presence of &#8220;people of color&#8221; for it to exist.In fact, it functions better without them.So what are they complaining about?Our superior society and standard of living is due to our industriousness and altrusim.</p>

<p>Contradictory, because you&rsquo;re not supposed to have anything that&rsquo;s only white.  Seems like this group needs to integrate.</p>
<p><i>The crowd &mdash; mostly young and white&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Meaning college students, meaning that there&rsquo;s a professor behind this.</p>
<p><i>ven Obama himself alluded to it, in my interview with him three years ago. &ldquo;If you ask people of all races, &lsquo;Is it tougher being black than white?,&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Imagine two people, one a black woman, one a white man, same age, same IQ, neither one of them have any college education, and both have the same rap sheet.  Who&rsquo;s going to have a better job?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;White privilege,&rdquo; one speaker said, &ldquo;is the enemy of equality.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I once went to a St. Louis-area BMW, and asked them to give me their top-of-the-line 7-series sedan, because of my white privilege.  The salesman (white) told me to get away or he was going to call the cops.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We have homework assignments,&rdquo; Fox said. &ldquo;Like at least once a day, use &lsquo;white&rsquo; as a descriptor for somebody. You discover how odd that sounds &mdash; &lsquo;the white professor&rsquo; or &lsquo;the white guy in the lobby.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Told you there was a prof behind this.</p>
<p><i>Even Obama himself alluded to it, in my interview with him three years ago. &ldquo;If you ask people of all races, &lsquo;Is it tougher being black than white?,&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Imagine two people, one black, one white, both have the same IQ, rap sheet, education level, personal demeanor.  Who&rsquo;s going to get the job?</p>

<p>Great&hellip;another reminder that my president is just as liberal as is my black Marxist &#8220;Women&rsquo;s Studies&#8221; professor (I had to take the class in order to graduate).</p>
<p>What these idiots don&rsquo;t get about white privilege is this: Even if I admit that it exists (and many people on this forum will most definitely argue that it doesn&rsquo;t), are these Marxist colored and white folks willing to admit that societies are NATURALLY structured thus? Is it really even possible to found a city, so to speak, or construct a society when you have people of different races and colors trying to act as equal partners in the process and in the completed result (the result being the society)? Isn&rsquo;t every society FOR the people who constructed it and FOR their descendants? WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE &#8220;PRIVILEGE&#8221; IN OUR OWN LAND. However, it&rsquo;s not really &#8220;privilege&#8221; so much as it is &#8220;inheritance.&#8221; I say, if they don&rsquo;t like the fact that we are privileged in our own land, they should just leave.</p>

		<p>I have never been able to relate to self-hating types. I firmly believe many actually enjoy wallowing in all this affected guilt, phoney introspection and self-flagellation. It feeds their masochism exquisitly. These are dysfunctional and decadent people - people who are easily mislead, easily made to believe the unbelievable, to embrace the irrational and to accept the implausible. </p>
<p>Tragically, this affliction seems to be a largely white phenomenon.  </p>

		<p>I wonder how beneficial that &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is in Japan and China? Zimbabwe? </p>
<p>The crowd &mdash; mostly young and white, with a hippie vibe, are the new recepients of my own ways to combat racism. </p>
<p>I guess the only way I can teach them THE LESSON, is to let them experience Affirmative Action firsthand. Let&rsquo;s see if I hire clueless whites. Let&rsquo;s see if any minorities are going to listen to them when these people began to complain about discrimination. </p>
<p>Clare Fox, you are a bigger enemy to me than Je$$e Jackson and Al &#8220;Shakedown&#8221; Sharpton combined. Only now, after all of these years, am I finally going on the offensive against your type.</p>
<p>I already know that if I hire a less qualified minority over you, your complaints will fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Clare, I guess it never occurred to you that WE don&rsquo;t have to practice job discrimination against minorites, or break some other law, if they don&rsquo;t even score in the top half to begin with. Their failures provide my intended result anyway, all perfectly legal. <br>
Passing you over for a minority, that too is perfectly legal.</p>
<p>Besides, I prefer the company of an MS-13 or a black gangbanger over some clueless white, self hating, liberal anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going after you and your type, with your own policies. Let me know if a minority hires you.</p>

		<p>How come whites can&rsquo;t talk publically about race and be pro-white or say unfavorable things about blacks or latinos?  When we whites can do that without getting ridiculed or fired or killed THEN we&rsquo;ll be having open dialog about race.  </p>

<p>I do this already, describe people as white.  It&rsquo;s necessary when you&rsquo;re hip-deep in the Enriching Joys of Diversity.  Also it&rsquo;s nice to know that, however much I may disagree with a particular white person, at least we haven&rsquo;t all disappeared yet.</p>

		<p>Quite frankly, it IS a privilege to be white. Unfortunately, in these buffoons eyes, that privilege is something to be ashamed of&hellip;something to apologize for. Crimeny. The privilege they talk of is currently enjoyed by those who live off of the wealth taken from whites and spread around to the slackers who still want more in the form of reparations. And it&rsquo;s just gonna get &#8220;better&#8221; come Jan 20th. </p>

What about &#8216;yellow privilege&rsquo;, perhaps it is a result of actually working hard and being brought up in a positive environment. And isn&rsquo;t it convenient that open talks about being &#8216;colorblind&rsquo; seem to be all about giving handouts to brown people, you don&rsquo;t hear much about the social responsibilities that come along with living in a white society/country. And if these bleeding hearts feel guilty about their white privilege (which of course is a result of our ancestors blood, sweat and sacrifice), I am sure that they could find a minority more than willing to part them from their wealth.<br>

For too long, minorities have done the heavy-lifting &mdash; explaining, excusing, fuming silently&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
and this should be a warning to all the liberals that after all the work you have done in the past you&rsquo;ll get little or no credit for it anyway, so what is the point. Aparently they have very (again conveniently) short memories.<br>

&ldquo;If you ask people of all races, &lsquo;Is it tougher being black than white?&rsquo;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
How do you qualify such a stupid question, I&rsquo;m sure I would have a hard time in a foreign culture too.<br>
And in the case of blacks (African ) when will they ever be happy that they live in a country capable of transplanting their heart for instances if need be.<br>

		<p>&#8220;For too long, minorities have done the heavy-lifting &mdash; &hellip;..&#8221;</p>
<p>As if Whites never did any hard work!  This is ridiculous!  And if you don&rsquo;t want to do menial tasks for a living, pay attention in school!  For at least 40 years, this once White nation has bent over backwards giving minorties, especially Blacks - who show the least bit of promise a ride on the red carpet.  How does anyone suppose Barack Obama&rsquo;s father got into Harvard???</p>
<p>This &#8220;White privilege&#8221; thing is a lie.  I don&rsquo;t know any White people who have had the world handed to them - they all had to work.  The only one&rsquo;s I know of who seem to have an easier time of it are very good looking women who get swept up into high class modeling.  But even that is not as easy as it looks&hellip;</p>
<p>I really think that this White Privilege complaint is what is claimed by those minorities who just don&rsquo;t want to try and then see others - mostly Whites succeed and then they create the attitude that this was because of an invisible privilege that comes with being White.</p>
<p>When I was starting off as a youth wanting to work, I had to work hard.  I remember two out of three of my bosses in those days saying to me, &#8220;I had a hard time when I was young, and you should too!&#8221;   They were harsh, demanding, unkind and White.  later, when I tried to get a job with the State, I found that because I was White, I had to get behind Blacks and other minorities.  Later, I was told that I could not get a Small Business Administration Loan because I was a White male.  That was in California.  I have NEVER in my life experienced any privilege for being a White male.  In the county I live in now in Washington, the overwhelming identity of country and city employees is female and minority - and that is in an 85% White majority county!</p>

It seems to me that they&rsquo;ve pretty much done <i>that</i> already for the last half-century: in welfare payments, hiring and school quotas, gerrymandered electoral districts, &#8220;hate crime&#8221; laws, handing over whole neighborhoods and school districts to blacks, electing a black President, and on and on <i>ad infinitum, </i> not to mention the obsequious deference whites such as those in the article continually render unappreciative blacks.<p>Whites have done all this for blacks, and yet blacks <i>still</i> have it &#8220;tougher than whites&#8221;??  All I have to say at this point is: &#8220;TOUGH!&#8221;</p></p></p>

<p>No, nature is the enemy of equality. I&rsquo;d like to have the business acumen of Bill Gates, the body of the model on the cover of the current issue of <i>Exercise for Men Only,</i> the charisma of Don Juan, etc. Nature hasn&rsquo;t deemed it to be so. </p>
<p>And I know of a nice neighborhood in Gary, Indiana where this speaker can go to live if he wants to give up some of his &#8220;white privilege,&#8221; rather than trying to guilt trip other whites into being as neurotic as he is.</p>
<p><i>it was nice to hear white people talk publicly, bluntly, about race. And not pretend to be colorblind.</i></p>
<p>This has got to be the funniest line in the whole article. The writer is invited to attend a future AR conference where the speakers are not only blunt but honest.</p>

<p>Okay so being white is a privilege.  But so is being smart; being good looking, and being rich. </p>
<p>Being good looking is a disadvantage in TV commercials.  The powers behind commercial advertising have outlawed ads with attractive white people.  Presenting an attractive (and intelligent) white  person next to a minority shows just how unattractive the minority is.  That&rsquo;s why all the nerds and mutts are starring in TV commercials.</p>
<p>Next time Clare Fox or Sandy Banks need a surgeon make them pick a non-privileged person to do it.</p>
<p>Minorities take advantage of white privilege.  Let&rsquo;s have minorities throw out all the inventions created by privileged whites and live for one week.  </p>
<p>What I like to see on Saturday Night Live.  A skit showing Obama new all black crew flying Air Force One.<br>

		<p> Im actually fortunately enough to be able to address a small sample of college students here at UCA on this topic. The gathering is about race and public opinion on campus. Four speakers(all white) are groveling their apologies for whiteness and preaching white guilt while I get to be the fifth speaker and my message will be the complete opposite. Should be interesting!</p>

Instead of feeling guilty, I felt totally justified and began reading the works of Jared Taylor, Samuel Francis and others and eventually finding my way to AmRen.

		<p> What a pitiful bunch of self-hating people! Every race throughout history has done things that most of us would consider bad, ignoble, unfair, etc. Why is it only Whites who feel that they have to &#8220;feel guilty&#8221; about the deeds of ancestors, and somehow &#8220;make amends&#8221; for them?</p>
<p> If one accepts the idea of &#8220;White privilege&#8221; in this country   &mdash;   which I don&rsquo;t   &mdash;   who is to say that the alleged privilege is not earned? In a very huge way, WE built this country. The others played secondary roles.</p>

It&rsquo;s certainly an idea that&rsquo;s been brought up before. </p>
<p>All around the world they seem intent of ridiculing, watching, controlling, regulating and containing the white man. It&rsquo;s almost a kind of war against white males. As if it&rsquo;s 1939, we&rsquo;re inside Nazi Germany, and we&rsquo;re the jews, responsible for all evil in the past and present. Every element in society seems encouraged to act against white men. Which is weird, because by all accounts, they should be at war with the black men of the world.  </p>

		<p>what they call white privilege is white success based on honesty, integrity, work ethic, courtesy, industriosness, concern, law abiding,and other good qualities that only white people possess. because of the these qualities and the way we treat each other, white people enjoy a higher quality of life. if i dont steal from you, you still have your stuff, that simple. these people will never get it, they all need to be put into re-education mental health centers. they think the horse that won the kentucky derby won because of privilege. the only privilege we have is because we were lucky to be born white.</p>

If they hate their whiteness so bad, then do us all a favor and take your life. You will not be missed. Life isn&rsquo;t easy for any of us. Being white means you stand a much greater chance of having a crime commited against you than if you were a minority. I really wish they would seriously consider hopping a ride on a spaceship with the Heaven&rsquo;s Gate loonies. Nobody in the minority classes of people deserve anymore help than do the whites. And I have started telling everybody just that, especially the minorities. Suck it up, earn your way, this white guy is tired of carrying your sorry butt.</p>

		<p>I am a racist and proud of it, because all it means is that I believe whites are the world&rsquo;s superior race.  This &#8220;fact&#8221; is validated by every means know to man to measure human accomplishments.  People throw the words &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221; around without even knowing what they mean.  Here is Webster&rsquo;s definition of &#8220;racism&#8221; and as you can see the word never even existed until 1933:</p>
<p>Main Entry: rac·ism  <br>
Pronunciation: \ˈrā-ˌsi-zəm also -ˌshi-\ <br>
Function: noun <br>
Date: 1933 <br>
1 : a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race</p>

Anybody here have any idea what &#8220;the UCLA Downtown Labor Center&#8221; is? Why does a university need a Labor Center?

<p>What exactly this UCLA Downtown Labor Center is and what they get up to, might be something for AmRen to investigate some time. Sounds to me like some sort of &#8220;outreach&#8221; program to spread left-wing agitation beyond the campus and into the wider world. </p>

		<p>White privilege? I&rsquo;m an upper middle class white male. I scored a 21 on my DAT (Dental Admissions Test, that&rsquo;s a 90%ile score, the average score of people accepted is an 18) and had a 3.5 GPA with two degrees, honors program, and a billion extracurriculars. 3 of the 7 people on the board of admissions to the school I applied to were my uncles and grandfather. Um, guess why I got turned down? And they told me this flat out: they had to &#8220;fill&#8221; a certain amount of &#8220;minority applicant seats&#8221; (a.k.a minority quota) and that &#8220;it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to evaluate us by the same criteria.&#8221; A black boy who took the Kaplan review course with me scored a 16 on the test with a 2.8 GPA and boasted at the time he&rsquo;d probably get in for being black. I called him up. He sure did get in. EVery asian girl in the class also got accepted. Yet I had the highest test scores and highest grade point average. Where&rsquo;s the meritocracy quotient in admitting people into medical professions? Now the medical school classes are going to be held back while they cater to the basically &#8220;special needs&#8221; students who can&rsquo;t even maintain a B average in college.

Modern &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; basically stands for being as racist as possible. As long as white men deracinated, aren&rsquo;t considered a race, or aren&rsquo;t really considered people, anything could happen to them. Who&rsquo;s to notice?</p>

		<p>If you love and are comfortable and secure with your Whiteness and are proud of your Heritage, why would you be offended by what anyone else says about White Racists?  If you are Pro-White that means you love your heritage and your skin color, or lack-there-of; but, you are not attracted to, nor are you threatened by or feel insecure because of any other race.  If you are Pro-White why not want everyone to be treated in a just and fair manner and have a chance at the same opportunities.  At the same time recognizing the fact that Black, Brown, Red or Yellow just is not your cup of tea.  There does not have to be any hatred, nor wishing harm or ill will on another race of people.  You just recognize that you have no desire to breed across racial lines with no other race but your own.  There is nothing wrong with white, black, brown, red, or yellow skin you just prefer White skin.  But, the problem is when you as a group feel threatened because you are recognizing your races&rsquo; population numbers are shrinking.  You recognize your $$ in your pocket is dwindling. You recognize your jobs are leaving.  How do you deal with those facts in a personal way, without blaming a group of  that you don&rsquo;t give a darn about! Instead blame the bums that you elected into political office.  As it stands now, all races and groups are suffering. Every other group is placing the blame where it needs to be, at the door step of the government. Elect the bums out of office. Blacks complain to the Government, Blacks march and picket the Government with grievances about equal justice, human rights, workers rights, civil rights, women&rsquo;s, working-class rights, middle-class rights, right to organize, etc, etc.  You need to march and picket the Government with your grievances too! </p>

		<p>White privilege is the invention of the racialist mob in an attempt force white people to admit that blacks and other people of color are at a distinct disadvantage in this country and, as such, should be entitled to greater support both financially and structurally (institutionally) than are white people.</p>
<p>The idea of white privilege is based on a misunderstanding (or failure) to understand the history of the white race in America. It&rsquo;s based on a desire not to research the current condition of the white race, as well. Jim Goad wrote a book called &ldquo;The Redneck Manifesto&rdquo; which is built around the following question: if white privilege exists, then how do you explain white trash? How can the the white people of the South (especially in Appalachia) and the Midwest and the Northern Plains, white people who have lived in poverty and illiteracy for generation after generation, be explained if they all are at an advantage based solely on their race?</p>
<p>The argument from the racialist mob is that these white people could, if they sought out education and cleaned themselves up a bit, take advantage of their white privilege. Of course, the average white racist would say that if black folks would speak correctly and seek out an education, then they&rsquo;d be just as likely as anyone else to succeed.</p>
<p>Since the idea of white privilege is based totally on observation, nobody has to be bothered with the millions of desperately poor white people who aren&rsquo;t observed because nobody cares. Nobody has to explain their existence in the face of such innate privilege. </p>

		<p>It can be argued that labeling the politically incorrect &#8216;racists&rsquo; has become a new of version of the &#8216;Hitler card&rsquo;. It goes like this:</p>

<p>Now: &#8220;You&rsquo;re wrong, because racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes the cards can be combined to form one ultimate, irrefutable debate-ending wildcard, for example:</p>

		<p>Many years ago I worked for a non-profit place that did international work mainly in family planning. They hired a guy from Mexico who was an MD, although he was not licensed to practice here in the U.S. and the job certainly did not require a medical degree. His English left much to be desired. He was hired to do the same job I did. I trained him and once he was trained they gave him a promotion and a big fat raise.</p>
<p>I went to EEOC and was told by the Black woman there that because his English wasn&rsquo;t very good he was &#8220;handicapped&#8221; and therefore I had no case. True story. </p>

<p>Whites are inherently more intelligent,more altruistic, more chivalrous, more long-term oriented. Aren&rsquo;t you glad that we are superior to other races, other nations? Without us, you&rsquo;d still be living in caves, not having invented the wheel, telephone, television, phonograph, IPod, TV, etc.</p>
<p>As to the second. TOO late. You talking to a news reporter to get this statement on air? OOOOPS&gt; a WHITE invention. A white construct (News, vs. mere gossip)</p>

		<p>Too many of us with some awareness of nature and nature&rsquo;s ways and thus about genes and race, think we can logically present our positions to those external Whites who hate us, and that we&rsquo;ll win new friends.</p>
<p>I think this is an error in thinking on our part.  I don&rsquo;t see any reason to be impolite to these external Whites, but I see them as a different people from us.  They look like us on the outside, but many of them, I believe, have a twist in their genes that makes them self-haters and by extension haters of other Whites who have awareness. They are not our people.</p>
<p>Thus, I think it wise to consider these people as alien to us and treat them that way and not try to bring them in from the cold. Ignore them, and circle the wagon of those who are aware.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we shouldn&rsquo;t try to educate other Whites who are just sleep walking through life about the correctness of our positions, but beyond exposing others to our truths to see who responds, it may be a waste of time to endlessly argue with the brain dead and gene dead ones.  Put out our positions and let those who agree join with their people  &mdash;  us.</p>

		<p>labor.ucla.edu  The downtown labor center is part of the larger UCLA labor center.  It is absolutely dedicated to replacing every White American worker with an illegal alien hispanic.</p>
<p>UCLA labor center receives millions of dollars worth of grants every year from the cheap labor food processing, construction, retail, hotel and restaurant employers who are intent on driving Whtie Americans out of the California labor market completely.</p>
<p>Basically it is a union busting scab glorifying organization hiding under the mask of anti White liberalism.</p>

On Labor Day, 2002, the UCLA Downtown Labor Center (DLC) opened its doors on Park View Street overlooking MacArthur Park. The ribbon-cutting ceremony was led by Governor Gray Davis, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Miguel Contreras, three international union presidents, numerous elected officials, and over seven hundred union members from the Los Angeles labor movement.</p>
<p>A downtown office for the UCLA Labor Center had been a long-term dream of director Kent Wong who commented, &#8220;It would be hard to find a better site for the Downtown Labor Center, located near the majority of L.A.&rsquo;s union halls and worker centers and in the heart of a diverse immigrant community.&#8221; For the staff of the Labor Center, the DLC is intended to not only build the bridge between the university and the Los Angeles labor community but also to support collaborative projects between unions, worker centers, and the broader community. </p>
<p>The DLC houses a growing library, workstations for student researchers, conference rooms, and staff offices. The center occupies two floors of the building and provides a centrally located meeting space for up to two hundred participants that is frequently used by unions and community partners. </p>
<p> <br>
The DLC furthers the existing work of the UCLA Labor Center by offering the nation&rsquo;s first Spanish-language leadership school, the Colegio de Liderazgo Laboral, an African American Leadership School, an Asian American Leadership School, and an LGBTQ Leadership School. Other schools target work at the intersection of various unions and community organizations.</p>
<p>Each summer the Downtown Labor Center also offers a ten-unit service learning class for undergraduates through the Labor Summer Internship Program (LSIP).</p>
<p>The Labor Center staff conduct ongoing labor education trainings as well as a variety of conferences and events. In addition, the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON), a grassroots organization working to improve the lives of day laborers in the United States, is based at the DLC.</p>
<p>To reserve space at the DLC, contact Andrea Arias at 213-480-4155 x206 or arias@irle.ucla.edu. <br>

		<p>I think the concept of white privilege is real. Even Obama himself alluded to it, in my interview with him three years ago. &ldquo;If you ask people of all races, &lsquo;Is it tougher being black than white?,&rsquo; I think white people know the answer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether you ask in Utah or in Chicago or in Los Angeles.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
What utter idiocy.  The concept of white privilege IS real, but it is because white parents and white children perpetuate white education and white culture.  Certain Asians have the same privilege, for the same reasons.  Blacks and Hispanics mostly do not, because they make different choices in raising children.  They do not share the values or intellect that made white culture what it is.  All they know is the &#8220;physical&#8221;, not the abstract.  So they are left trying to take that which whites have made.  Despite the fact that liberals bend over backwards to hand them things they haven&rsquo;t earned.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I went to EEOC and was told by the Black woman there that because his English wasn&rsquo;t very good he was &ldquo;handicapped&rdquo; and therefore I had no case. True story.&#8221; <br>
Posted by at 12:10 AM </p>
<p>I absolutely do believe you.  I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re a white male or what  (you didn&rsquo;t say), but I am,  and I too once  had occasion to go to EEOC (a black woman again).  She actually found my story rather amusing, in fact.  (I didn&rsquo;t.)  Then, after having  herself a good chuckle (I failed to see any humor in the situation, which was pretty severe), she also  told me that I &#8220;had no case&#8221;, that she could do nothing, it was not an EEO matter, ushered me to the door,  and said goodbye.</p>
<p>Later, I was advised by outside legal counsel to go to the state Human Rights commission with the matter (a case involving violence, threats, verbal abuse, and actual physical assault on the job).  They found that I certainly DID have a case, and were appalled that EEOC had turned me down so casually.  They also found  the EEOC counselor to have been completely derelict in her duty  (it turned out she didn&rsquo;t even bother to keep any notes or record of our interview, which was mandated at the very least).  </p>
<p>She (the councilor) then lied to them and claimed that she had just  been waiting for me to &#8220;make up my mind&#8221; as to how I wanted to proceed  and get back to her.  She told them that I was too confused to know what I wanted to do just then (a lie).  She said she was eager to help and that I had promised to call her back, but that I never bothered to do so  (another  complete lie).   </p>
<p>When she leaned that the matter had come into the hands of the Commission, she  then called me and proceeded to carry on and berate me for daring to go to the State.  (How I wish I could have had a recording of this!)   She said she had been waiting for months to hear from me, but that I failed to give her a call. (This after she had clearly told me she  &#8220;would not be taking a case on this&#8221;  and that this was not an EEO matter.)  </p>
<p>I asked her why would I call her if she had told me that I &#8220;had no case&#8221; and this was the end of the mater?   She said she NEVER said  any such thing!   I then asked her, if she was waiting all this time to hear from me and wondered why I didn&rsquo;t call,  why didn&rsquo;t she give me a call and ask?   She haughtily said, &#8220;We don&rsquo;t call people!  You have to call us. We&rsquo;re not allowed to do that.&#8221;    I replied, &#8220;Well, you just did!   How do we happen to be having this conversation?&#8221;   She then hung up on me.</p>
<p>Bottom line:  Unless you&rsquo;re black and female, EEO is useless.  The propaganda line we&rsquo;re fed in employee publications and meetings is that &#8220;EEO is for everybody.&#8221;  Nonsense!  They run it like a little family business, just for themselves. </p>
<p>There was a site on the Internet, some years ago, about people&rsquo;s terrible experiences with EEO. I don&rsquo;t know where, or if it&rsquo;s still there. Their consensus was that you&rsquo;ll only make a bad situation worse by going to EEO.  They&rsquo;re right. Given the kind of people who staff it, that&rsquo;s no surprise.<br>

		<p>Everyone has reasons to be proud of their particular part of the human family, as well all peoples starting out as competing sperm cells have strived to exel. Competition is fundamental in nature, if (some) foolish whites want to beat themselves over the back because their team was on the winning side in recent times, I&rsquo;ll supply them with a rubber hose. Masochism is funny to watch, and while their at it they might want to nueter themselves, weed out the pathetic genes. If these guys really want pleasure pain they can go to SA or a federal prison where lonely black men would be glad help them.</p>

Guilt is a strategy engaged in by the loosers to make the winners feel ashamed and unworthy. </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do it to ourselves; it is done TO us. But they can impose it on us only if we let them.  Thus, if they couldn&rsquo;t beat you in one way, they&rsquo;ll still find a way beat you in another. They&rsquo;re still looking for a way to snatch your trophy. When you are king of the hill, the only answer is eternal vigilance.</p>
