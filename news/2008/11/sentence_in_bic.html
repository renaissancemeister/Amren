<h1>Sentence in Bicyclist&rsquo;s Death Displeases Family of Victim</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Morris, Kansas City Star, November 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The family of a Kansas City crime victim fumed Monday as a Jackson County judge sentenced their loved one&rsquo;s killer to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>Before Judge Jay Daugherty announced the sentence for Fabian D. Brown Jr., Robert Osborn&rsquo;s brothers urged him to tear up the plea agreement and take Brown to trial, hoping that he would get a life sentence.</p>
<p>But with conflicting testimony between co-defendants &mdash; particularly as to who pulled the trigger &mdash; the plea bargain held.</p>
<p>&#8220;The judge followed the bureaucratic guidelines,&#8221; said Rick Osborn, Robert&rsquo;s oldest brother. &#8220;That was the safe course to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>At his guilty plea in October, Brown said that he and co-defendant Rapheal Willis killed Osborn in November 2005 after they saw him riding a bicycle near 47th Street and Blue Ridge Boulevard.</p>
<p>Brown said he fired two shots from a hunting rifle but missed. The pair then drove down the road and ambushed Osborn, this time killing him with a 12-gauge shotgun.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Willis pleaded guilty in August, he said Brown killed Osborn.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>That was a cold-blooded murder. They missed him at first, then the stalked him down and hunted him like an animal. For them to have wanted to kill him that badly, it must have been a hate crime. Yet the article of course says nothing about it being charged as a hate crime. </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know who pulled the trigger? I&rsquo;ve got an idea  &mdash;  give them both life in prison. These are vicious animals.</p>

		<p>I agree with the judge.  A &#8220;jury,&#8221; in Kansas City parlance, means black, means a significant change of nullification.</p>
<p>There was a similar case in St. Louis several years ago.  A black 19-year old man was speeding drunk on in St. Louis&rsquo;s Forest Park, on the street leading up to the entrance of the St. Louis Zoo.  Zoo patrons must park across the street, cross the street to the Zoo entrance.  The man hit a 7-year old white boy who was crossing the street to go to the Zoo, and killed him.  The Circuit Attorney (Jennifer Joyce, that name was in the news in late September, if you remember the &#8220;Obama Truth Squads&#8221;) and the thug&rsquo;s PD copped a 15-year in prison plea deal.  The judge, whose name I will not divulge, has a reputation as being a conservative hanging judge (rare for state level trial judges in St. Louis City), but, like the KC judge in this story, accepted the plea deal.  A lot of people I know was mad at the judge for much the same reason as is the anger in this article, but my response was the same.  If the judge would have chucked the plea deal and called a trial, you would have had at least a 4-of-12 black jury, probably more.  A guaranteed 15 in prison was better than an acquittal.</p>

		<p>This vicious attack would have been blamed on &#8220;poverty&#8221; and &#8220;poor education&#8221; but two generations later and trillions of dollars in affirmative action has resulted in no improvement in the behavior. </p>

		<p>If the races had been reversed, the entire background of the White man would have been investigated. If he had made one racial slur in his life, he would have been charged with a hate crime. Even if he didn&rsquo;t, it would be assumed it was a hate crime and he would have gotten life.</p>

		<p>The problem in this case is with the law.  In Florida there would be no plea bargain in this case.  If someone is killed during a felony both parties would be charged with murder.  The common defense of &#8220;I ain&rsquo;t do it&#8221;, that has worked on numerous occasions in crimes like these would cease to be effective.  There was a case in Philadelphia not long ago where a group of black &#8220;youth&#8221; wanted to attack some white people.  During this expression of black rage one of these youths shot and killed a white teenager.  Police caught all who were involved but couldn&rsquo;t determine who pulled the trigger, as all were using the defense of &#8220;I ain&rsquo;t do it&#8221;.  This led to the plea bargain of ridiculously short sentences.  As I believe group attacks like these will increase for obvious reasons there must be a drive to change the laws so that acts like these can be punished as they should.  </p>

		<p>Ever notice how easy black men get off for killing whites?  </p>
<p>They can say &#8220;we killed him because we thought he had money&#8221; (he IS white after all!). That is enough to get gutless white cops to look the other way.  But it won&rsquo;t work for you.  Imagine killing a Jew and claiming it was not race-based, you did it because everyone knows Jews have money. What do you think the cops and Bnai B&rsquo;rith would say to you?</p>
<p>Blacks can kill a white man purely for boredom (sport, more likely) and they will get turned loose.  Imagine you, a white man,  did exactly the same thing to a homosexual or a black man.  Do you imagine for one moment you would get off with a slap on the wrist?</p>
<p>It is important to understand this. Now that Obama and his brothers are in charge, look for America to get even worse for you and your children. Go read http://www.zasucks.com to understand what black rule means to white folks.</p>

		<p>So the value of an innocent White life is fifteen years for which the perpetrator will serve less than five. A life forever cut short merely as sport? Where is the equity in this?</p>
<p>This is but a poignant testament to political correctness. A White life with some value is compared to an African - American life with none, yet the African - American will live out his life while the White - American&rsquo;s corpse lies rotting in his grave. Every day the African - American lives is a day forever denied to the White - American! This is justice?</p>
<p>In my view this African should experience the needle with perpetual sleep! And soon!</p>

		<p>There is outrage upon outrage: These two blacks went out to hunt down and kill a random white just for &#8220;sport&#8221;. (They&rsquo;d tracked a white female motorist before they spotted Robert Osborn on a bike and targeted him. And there has been suspicions of possible connection to other similar random killings/shootings of whites in the Kansas City area.) This is CLEARLY  a capital murder case: These two black killers should be facing the death penalty. But the BLACK prosecutor in this case, over the strenuous objections of the white victim&rsquo;s family, gave the black killer a sweetheart deal, the maximum sentence for which was only 20 years (meaning parole in just a few years). But the judge compounded this outrage by not even mandating the maximum sentence of 20 years, instead giving the black killer only 15 years. This black killer will be out on the streets prowling for more whites to kill for fun, with parole in 5 years, still in his 20&rsquo;s.<br/>
Compare this sentence to the quick death penalty meted out to the two whites who killed a black in Jasper TX. <br/>
And compare how this clear black on white racial hate crime has been swept under the rug by the media, particularly the racial aspect, while the Jasper TX white on black case resulted in national hysteria with race emphasized. <br/>
FEDERAL HATE CRIME CHARGES NEED TO BE PURSUED in order for justice be done on behalf of Robert Osborn, whose civil rights to use the public streets were clearly violated by these two black racist killers!<br/>
This year another black methodically ran down with his car two white bicyclists near Longview Lake in Grandview MO (suburb of Kansas City MO), killing them, and was allowed to walk.<br/>
Sport killing of whites by blacks is pretty common across the country. Years back a particularly notorious case occurred in the Westport neighborhood of Kansas City MO when black teens in a pickup randomly shot dead for sport a white kid, Brian Gromowsky (check spelling), standing on a street corner eating a pizza. And just recently (this September) a randomly targeted white girl, Devin Cassidy, was senselessly shot dead as she entered her car, by two black youths, Brandon R. Smith and Claude L. Sterling, again in the same popular Westport entertainment district. <br/>

		<p>Look at this typical black posting on the Kansas City Star site of this article:<br/>
&#8220;White people are whining and crying about this but has it not occord  to you all that you have a lot of karma to work out after 500 years of slavery. I am not justifying this murder but I would rather be Fabian Brown than a typical white person come judgement day. Peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>This really makes you want to live around blacks, given that this ignorant stupidity, this attitude, is widespread among blacks! What the hell did Robert Osborn, a poor grocery store late night stocker who had to get around on a bike, have to do with slavery that ended 150 years ago? Or any other living white? What about the &#8220;karma&#8221; of all the black Africans who ran the slave trade, capturing, enslaving, marching to the coast, and selling other black Africans? And let&rsquo;s not forget that at the time of slavery only a small handful of the wealthiest whites owned slaves: The vast majority did not. Nor did all the whites living in the North and elsewhere in the world. And it was whites who ended slavery. Hundreds of thousands of whites died in the Civil War, which ended slavery. But this is all idiotic anyway, since it is irrelevant.<br/>
And what about the far more relevant &#8220;karma&#8221; of blacks today: Given that over one million whites are victims of violence at the hands of blacks each year TODAY in America, twelve times the reverse, something that has been going on for over half a century now! Including the murder of more whites at the hands of blacks every two years than blacks where ever lynched in the entire history of this country. Including the rape of 30,000 white women by black males every year in this country, the reverse nearly non-existent. Would that excuse any white who does something to a black? Of course not. But that is the line of reasoning of these stupid ignorant black racists who make up a huge segment of the black population, and who are egged on by all the leftwing media and academic hate-whitey propaganda, that results in this kind of black attitude and bloodshed, such as happened to Robert Osborn.<br/>

		<p>To my fellow Amrenners:</p>
<p>All is NOT lost. Firearms sales in all 50 states have gone up, since Obama&rsquo;s election. This article also underscore&rsquo;s why Caucasians have been doing the bulk of the buying.<br/>
The Supreme Court decision in the D.C. v. Heller case, concealed carry in 48 of the 50 sttates, and &#8216;Castle Doctrine&#8221; in about 20 or so states, are all tools we have at our disposal, that weren&rsquo;t there during the time of the Watts, Detroit, Newark, NJ, or King assasination riots.</p>
<p>Many of the sheeple who voted for Obama cannot understand the upward spike in gun sales. They still think Obama won&rsquo;t come after the guns. I say, the experience of New Orleans, under the non-direction of that POS Nagin will be what Obama will try to do.</p>

<p>What a difference if this bored animal had taken a bullet from a defending human. Look, it is pretty clear that Whites are not going to get Justice from their own justice system, horrible but true nonetheless. Millions of whites in Rhodesia, South Africa Europe and the USA have said to themselves as life fades from their eyes, &#8220;But I did nothing to deserve death!&#8221; We are at the mercy of 12% of the population who use us for entertainment and refer to us as &#8220;food&#8221;</p>

		<p>Remember a couple of years ago in Texas when David Tuck, a white youth who severely beat a Hispanic youth, was given LIFE in prison.  However when a Black kills a white for fun, they are given only 15 years.  At least Tuck thought he had a reason to attack the Hispanic kid (the Hispanic was coming on to a 12-yr-old white girl).  In comparison, Brown et al. had no reason at all to attack Osborn, who was minding his own business, and hurting no one.</p>

		<p>This incident illustrates the importance of steering well clear of dangerous streets and areas whenever possible. Even the poor cannot assume to be immune or invisible to people who seize every opportunity to lash out or prey on others. Civility in my home town has fallen in direct proportion to the demographic changes we are all so well aware of. Like defensive driving, a little defensive living is in order.</p>

<p>I gave it up years ago after five or six incidents of car swerving to scare me.  Every time it was mexicans who made the threat.  The last time a white girl was riding with her muchacho and she did not appear upset by what was taking place.</p>

		<p>Being armed is nice but it&rsquo;s a long way from being safe. An armed man can always be ambushed, even a police officer. The only thing that keeps citizens safe is respect for and even fear of the law. </p>
<p>Blacks have no respect for or fear of the law. For a black amn to go to prison is much like going to a class reunion. What blacks do have a fear of is rope, that&rsquo;s why the start to cry every time a noose is found hanging anywhere. A noose represents real retribution for crimes commited. </p>
<p>I took the time to read the stories behind all those lynchings at the Southern Lynching Exhibit. All those guys were not lynched for looking at white girls the way liberals would have you believe. They commited some pretty terrible crimes. Many of the crimes were much like this one but the difference was that local citizens would not stand for it and took matters into their own hands. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that anyone be dragged out and hanged but I am saying that until some form of retribution is found that will inspire some sort of respect for the law among the black population then no one is going to be safe. </p>
<p>For the general population not to feel unsafe is just what any form of totalitarian government plans for. The government wants you to be scared so you will give up more and more of your freedoms for safety. The less freedom you have the more power they have.   All this is not an accident.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s simply not good enough.  The &#8220;right thing&#8221; would have been the maximum penalty for premeditated murder, with &#8220;hate crime&#8221; included.  The judge and prosecutor failed us all.</p>
<p>If a jury later set the killers free, then it&rsquo;s the media&rsquo;s job to publicize it.</p>

One thing that really bothers me is the absolute willingness of white liberals to &#8220;look the other way&#8221;  from the black on white hate crime. I have argued with several about this.  They refuse to admit that there is any such thing as a black on white hate crime. They are however very quick to admit to believing that white on black crime is some sort of rampant plague. Several of these &#8220;discussions&#8221; have become pretty heated.  It usually begins when I ask &#8220;so you believe  black on white race based hate crimes are commonly committed but your telling me you do not believe black on white hate crimes even exist.?&#8221;  Then they stop making sense and the hostility begins. </p>

		<p>Southern Hoosier: I live outside of Atlanta. A brutal murder of a white woman took place in the seat of my home county in &#8216;81. Her friend who was with her survived and helped catch the perps, who were 3 black guys. One of them was eligible for the death penalty, but the one black juror (a man) voted against the death penalty. The others voted in favor of it. I was outraged, although my liberal brother sided with the black. Whites did not riot, of course.</p>

		<p>I found out recently that a guy I used to know was given over 30 years for counterfeiting.  In truth, it was a second offense, so the court called him a &#8220;habitual offender&#8221; (Three separate felony convictions will get you this, or two of the same sort.)</p>
<p>The feds have been saying for the last few years that they want to increase the money supply; I suppose Robert merely thought he&rsquo;d help.  His estimated release date is in 2037.  He didn&rsquo;t hurt anyone, let alone commit an unprovoked killing of someone he didn&rsquo;t even know.  I hope this gives everyone a better idea of our legal system&rsquo;s priorities.</p>

		<p>Given that over one million whites are victims of violence at the hands of blacks each year TODAY in America, twelve times the reverse, something that has been going on for over half a century now! Including the murder of more whites at the hands of blacks every two years than blacks where ever lynched in the entire history of this country. Including the rape of 30,000 white women by black males every year in this country, the reverse nearly non-existent. </p>
<p>No legitimate government would tolerate a race of so called humans who commit this amount of crime against their own population. This makes a very good case for deportation back to Africa, since this isn&rsquo;t likely to happen, unless whites became self aware and take back their government. </p>
