	<p>A shortage of sperm donors in Britain has led to long waits at clinics and even caused some clinics to stop offering donor sperm, fertility specialists are reporting, and they are calling for nationwide changes to increase the supply.</p>

<p>Interesting isn&rsquo;t it, that these people would prefer Nordic Genes. The author of a previous article posted here a few days ago about how everyone would be interbreeding, and the races would merge into one hybrid, obviously hasn&rsquo;t heard about this. This proves what I&rsquo;ve been saying about miscegenation, which is that few people will ever go for it. When someone chooses to be artificially inseminated with donor sperm, they are looking at reproduction through a purely mechanical prism, rather than the far fetched romantic delusion that so many Westerners have about marriage and family. Most people say that they don&rsquo;t have a problem with interracial relationships, but oddly enough, they almost always end up marrying and having children with people of the same race. I&rsquo;m not arguing that interracial dating isn&rsquo;t on the rise, but as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, dating is about as far as it goes. When young people experiment with interracial dating, it&rsquo;s just that, an experiment. Dating today is seen more as recreation, as opposed to a direct path to marriage that previous generations saw it as. It should be no surprise then, that younger people don&rsquo;t discriminate on the same level as previous generations, but you can be sure that when it comes time for someone to decide who they will have children with, and spend the rest of their life with, the vast majority will pick someone of the same race.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The fertility society has already rejected several other proposed remedies, saying that the maximum age for sperm donors should not be raised above 40, and that the standards for semen quality should not be lowered. &#8220;</p>
<p>Mothers over 35 risk having Down syndrome children.  Fathers over 40 risk having autistic children.  Researchers have discovered that the one thing autistic children have in common is fathers who are old in reproductive terms.</p>
<p>Much of the old father autism is caused by the fact that affordable family formation no longer exists for the under age 35 group.  It takes years of college, internships, low paid entry level jobs, paying off student loans etc to be in a position to start a family nowdays.</p>
<p>So autism has risen because of these over 40 age fathers.  Researchers first noticed that autism was more common among the highly educated and well off.  Today, well educated and well off means not having children until the late 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>As for the notion that children conceived by artificial insemination should be able to track down the father 20 years later; it&rsquo;s just one more feel good liberal do gooder notion that will have terrible repercussions.</p>
<p>Next thing the feminazis will force a law that says the donors must pay child support.</p>
<p>I learned in nursing school that the peak of fertility is 16 to 25.  The very best outcomes for both mother and child is 22 years old.</p>
<p>After 25, fertility goes downward.  At age 30, fertility is 70 percent less than it was at age 16.  After 35 it is difficult to naturally conceive, especially if it is a first pregnancy.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fool mother nature.  This idea of 40 year old women and 50 year old men having their first child is biologically extremely difficult.</p>

<i>&ldquo;Technically, you could be placed on a waiting list with no sign of an end, because there are no donors in your locality. We suspect lots of people go to Spain and Belgium.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>He said sperm were also being imported, mostly from Scandinavia.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad AR posted this article because it shows there is still a healthy drive by our people to continue our race and that people are willing to travel the world to find the genetic stock they are looking for. People do want babies that look like them and their parents.</p>
<p>This could also be a great opportunity for an enterprising team of businessmen.</p>
<p>I can envision opening a sperm bank from donors around the world for the same reason as there are now a global seed vault to store our world plant diversity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/02/28/world/20080228VAULT_index.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/02/28/world/20080228VAULT_index.html</a></p>
<p>Such a sperm bank needn&rsquo;t be racially exclusive. Far from it. It could hold the genetic material of all the worlds&rsquo; races. It&rsquo;s mandate would be to preserve human evolutionary diversity. In that regard, the mandate should be to match genetic strains as closely as possible. If people wanted to mix racially, they would be free to do so in the old fashioned way but this sperm bank would be solely to preserving and perpetuating unique human genetic diversity. This human genetic vault would be a living bank of on-going donors and recipients of similar genetic makeup.</p>
<p>Far from objecting, everyone who uses the word &lsquo;diversity&rsquo; would have to give their support otherwise they would be exposed as the lying frauds they appear to be. How could they object to preserving blond hair, black hair, red hair brown hair, green eyes, blue eyes, brown eye, all found in the diversity of the Caucasian race. The UN would even have to support such a project if they believed in human diversity.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the sperm of white men is still even legal in Britain.  After all, white sperm can cause white people to be born and that could be offensive to some minorities.</p>

		<p>Many sperm donors are young Australian males - we aim to conquer Britain genetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up to a third of sperm donors in London fertility clinics are now foreigners and many are visitors from Down Under. One of the biggest clinics, the Bridge Centre, confirmed Australian backpackers were becoming donors to earn money to support their travels&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need them. We need that winning spirit and we need left-handed batsmen so we&rsquo;re hoping that&rsquo;s in the gene set,&#8221; Mr Mott said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re on the grand tour and you&rsquo;re spending 12 months in the UK, here&rsquo;s something you can do to make a bit of extra money.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should have it on the same &#8216;to do list&rsquo; as going to the rugby at Twickenham.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a good cause and if we get enough Australian donors you could end up colonising the UK instead of the other way round.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be entirely so sure.  Nordic genes?  Considering the Babel that&rsquo;s in Scandinavia nowadays, there&rsquo;s no guarantee of it.  And I doubt if they&rsquo;re allowed  to ask or to specify.  That would be &#8220;racist&#8221;!   I wonder if you have to just accept whatever you get out of the grab bag.</p>

		<p>I hope the recipients of donated sperm are given free choice (in light of England&rsquo;s utterly asinine laws regarding free speech, freedom of choice, freedom of association) whether they want a donor racially like themselves? Or would NOT wanting a bi-racial child be considered a capital crime in &#8216;modern, progressive&rsquo; Great Britain?</p>

		<p>Why would any WHITES really WANT a biracial child? The term simply evokes contempt and dislike for parent and child alike. If the parents were a White couple, taking a mixed breed child out&hellip; you can imagine the furtive smirks, half-hidden laughter at the perceived cuckolded husband. Furthermore, what if very FEW people selected a non-White donor? Would they be forced to accept and raise a mixed-breed child? Talk of an Orwellian nightmare even Orwell did not imagine.</p>

<p>Well, that is a loophole that will have to be clamped  down on!<br>
Considering that it&rsquo;s Batty Britain, they will soon mandate  that you cannot ask or specify what you want. You will just have to take what you get.<br>

<p>I beg to differ with this opinion.  This action was implemented to destroy the white race.  The very idea of suing the donor father for child support. Ha!</p>
<p>And when the honest older white woman needs a circlage, that is the banding of the cervix to prevent a premature birth, you will find that it is either not available to her, after spending $12,000 for a $200 IVF procedure, or will be used to stage the medical accident that either kills or damages the baby.</p>
<p><b><br>
&ldquo;The fertility society has already rejected several other proposed remedies, saying that the maximum age for sperm donors should not be raised above 40, and that the standards for semen quality should not be lowered. &ldquo;</b></p>

</p>
<p>And you can bet that beautiful white children are given the special vaccinations that cause the autism.  Just can not have intelligent children inheriting family fortunes at a young age after being raised by intelligent older people who have seen the machinations of the hate crazed system.  </p>

<p>Robert Graham was effectively shut down by the government for doing this.  And so was his heir to the project.</p>
<p>Reproductive rights in practice are war by other means.</p>
<p>If we are going to survive then we must change our perspective on reproductive behavior.  This is not a level playing field.</p>
