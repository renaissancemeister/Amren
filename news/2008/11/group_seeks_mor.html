<h1>Group Seeks More Minority Coaches</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Alesia, Indianapolis Star, November 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Black Coaches and Administrators stepped up pressure on major-college football programs to increase the number of minority head coaches Wednesday by announcing it will retain an employment lawyer to provide free consultations for job candidates.</p>
<p>Floyd Keith, executive director of the Indianapolis-based BCA, tried to avoid talking about a possible civil rights lawsuit but acknowledged information from job candidates &#8220;could be followed through on a legal avenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the way we have to deal with it at this point,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At the end of this season, there will be four black head coaches among 119 schools (3 percent) in the Football Bowl Subdivision &mdash; Buffalo&rsquo;s Turner Gill, Houston&rsquo;s Kevin Sumlin, Miami&rsquo;s Randy Shannon and Mississippi State&rsquo;s Sylvester Croom.</p>
<p>Among players in Division I football, 46 percent are black.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the BCA issued its fifth annual report card on the hiring processes used by Division I college football programs to fill openings for head coaches.</p>
<p>BCA president Paul Hewitt, men&rsquo;s basketball coach at Georgia Tech, said the report cards have succeeded in increasing minorities among job candidates and on search committees. But, he wrote in the report, they are too often not the final choice.</p>

			<p>Here is the story of Ron Prince, recently fired Kansas State black head football coach.  Legendary head football coach Bill Snyder stepped down after the 2005 football season.  A succession plan was talked about for years where one of the many successful assistant football coaches who coached under Bill Snyder would take his place.  If the timing was not right for a former Snyder assistant a coach with a Kansas State connection or someone else who would fit in the system Bill Snyder built would be hired.</p>
<p>Then the university president, Jon Wefald got involved.  President Wefald has been an excellent university president, but is a diversity fanatic.  The first black applicant Wefald and the athletic director spoke to, Ron Prince, was hired. If Wefald had vetted Ron Prince he would have interviewd additional black candidates. </p>
<p>In less than 3 years Ron Prince alientated everyone associated with Kansas State football.  Things are so bad that after the 2009 football season the talent level will drop tremendously. Hence Ron Prince&rsquo;s firing in less than 3 years as Kansas State&rsquo;s head football coach.</p>

			<p>If they get their way, they will have asked for and received the same kind of affirmative action that led to 46% in D-I skins being black.  C&rsquo;mon, you don&rsquo;t really think that most of them were merely bring college students who just wanted to come out for football, do you?</p>
<p>Reminds me of a scene from an early 1990s movie, &#8220;The Program.&#8221;  The star defensive player (black) at the fictional Eastern State University (ESU), which, IINM, used LSU&rsquo;s stadium as its own in the filming, is studying with his tutor (white).  The tutor asked him who fought in the Punic Wars.  His answer was Detroit and Buffalo.  </p>
<p>Hell, I learned about the Punic Wars in the 6th Grade, that they were between Rome, during the approximate mid-point of Rome&rsquo;s Republican era, and Carthage, modern-day Tunisia, ancient city of Carthage being where modern Tunisia is.  I also learned in 6th grade that the Roman Senator, Cato, ended all his Senate speeches for a time with the phrase &#8220;Cartago Delenda Est&#8221; (&#8220;Carthage must be destroyed.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The player depicted in &#8220;The Program&#8221; was a college junior.  It might be a movie, but I&rsquo;m sure there are many real-life analogues.</p>
<p>BTW, if anyone can Latinize &#8220;diversity&#8221; or &#8220;equality,&#8221; add &#8220;delenda est&#8221; to it and that might make a good screen name for any AmRen regular that wants to use it.</p>

			<p>I stopped watching sports when quotas for minority coaches and minority announcers were mentioned. I found the behavior of those who insist on quotas disgusting, so I tuned out and I won&rsquo;t be tuning back in or knowingly supporting their sponsors.</p>

			<p>Yup, there should be more black and minority coaches just like Mike Singeltary of the SF 49s. What a character. He should be the poster boy for all black coaches. I can see him now posing and smiling with his trousers down at his ankles.</p>

			<p>It would be nice if the BCA would put that much energy into solving the black high school drop out rate that is higher than the 46% of Division I&rsquo;s football players.<br>
The colleges will cave and hire them anyway.<br>
The best cure for diversity is to live with it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Increasing the number of non-whites interviewed for coaching jobs not enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anbody who follows sports anymore is someone who supports blacks and their agenda.</p>

<p>In black areas, the official proclamation is that &#8216;employees must be more representative of the community they serve&rsquo;. In white areas, the proclamation is that we need more &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and that anything less is evil. </p>

			<p>I know of two star athletes from my county that were not given scholarships. They were walk-ons because it was assummed that their parent&rsquo;s had enough money to support them through college.<br>
The deserving who worked harder, player or coach, should not be put at the back of the line automatically. But, that&rsquo;s what this whole country is nowadays.</p>

			<p>This is obvious.  If blacks are demanding that the coaching positions match the number of blacks in sports then perhaps whites need to demand that whites participate in sports in proportion to their numbers in the population as a whole.  Imagine the NBA being 12% black, 12% Hispanic, 74% white, 2% asian, and a native american mascott.  </p>

			<p>To Question Diversity:</p>
<p>Funny about the Punic Wars. But, that&rsquo;s only a movie. Some real-life college students are just about as stupid as the black in the movie. Consider:</p>
<p>They did a survey a few years ago about the Vietnam War. The researchers found about 55% of the college students they surveyed, thought the United States fought alongside North Vietnam during the war.</p>
<p>Another college student thought Latin America was where they speak the Latin language.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my favorite. A senior college student thought Peter Ustinov was a leader in the Russian Revolution of 1917. I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>
<p>To tran:</p>
<p>Two sports come to mind that don&rsquo;t have blacks, and therefore, the spectators aren&rsquo;t supporting them: NASCAR and Professional Bull Riding.</p>
<p>Oh, the PBR does have Brazilians in it. But almost all off them resemble Basque Spaniards, than resemble Pele. The PBR did have one black in it - Lee Akin, who is now paralyzed for life, as a result of being injured by a bull, several years ago.</p>
