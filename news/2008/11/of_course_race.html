				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John McWhorter, New York Post, November 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After all, I have a reputation, albeit oversimplified, as a &#8220;black conservative.&#8221; I work for a free-market think tank. I&rsquo;m supposed to be &#8220;controversial.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this means the people expecting potshots from me against Obama have assumed that his race has no resonance for me. They have assumed that I would argue not to take his race into account.</p>
<p>There is a conservative part of me that went there at first. Two years ago, when most people didn&rsquo;t know much about Obama beyond his 2004 speech at the Democratic convention and some &#8220;Yes, we can&#8221; rhetoric, I irritated many with an editorial saying that if Obama were white, no one would yet consider him special. And at the time it was true.</p>
<p>But as time went by, I realized that where the Obamenon was concerned, race did matter. This time, assessing Obama by the content of his character alone would evidence a lack of genuine concern about getting past race in America.</p>
<p>This has not been a mere matter of supporting Obama because he&rsquo;s &#8220;a brother.&#8221; Rather, I firmly believe that with Obama in the White House, people insisting that America is all about racism will have to rethink their message. Joe Six-Packs were in diners telling reporters they wouldn&rsquo;t vote for a black man? Well, there will be a black man riding in Air Force One. Like the Wicked Witch of the West, those yokels &#8220;have no power here&#8221; &mdash; Obama does.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But even if Obama did not espouse these positions, I would have been for him this year. Race matters &mdash; yet his Presidency will make it matter less so.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The queasiness is because, in my heart of hearts, there is a part of me that thrills to the Obamas because of a red-blooded racial loyalty. There. I admit it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And: Young people growing up under an Obama administration will see it as normal for the President to be black, and be that much more past race than we are. My wife looked to me and pointed out that our future children will be, as I have termed it, Obamakids.</p>
<p>This messy tribal feeling has not been my main reason for supporting Obama. But it&rsquo;s been roiling underneath. And it&rsquo;s why I am so uncomfortable with the anti-Obama image many people had of me. In their minds, almost every black person on earth is toasting and jamming the phone lines, while I&rsquo;m sitting glumly in a bar grumbling about taxes and William Ayers.</p>
<p>Sorry, folks &mdash; I&rsquo;m not that controversial. Tuesday was a glorious night and I can&rsquo;t pretend it wasn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s going to be a brother in the White House! Yeah &mdash; I feel it too.<br>

			<p>I have more proof that race mattered:</p>
<p>I was looking at the exit polls from Mississippi.  88% of whites voted for McCain, and 98% of blacks for Obama.  91% of whites over 30 voted McCain, 81% of whites under 30 did.  Among whites, the genders were virtually equal in their age category.</p>
<p>The hope for white Americans is that, as the country becomes more &#8220;diverse,&#8221; then elections in the whole country will become Mississippiized, i.e. racial headcounts.</p>

			<p>One good thing about all of this is that blacks can no longer blame the white man for their condition. After all, don&rsquo;t we now have a black man in the White House ? They are going to sit back and expect the new president to hand them everything on a silver platter. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to think of this. Usually he&rsquo;s intelligent, but this seems pretty idiotic.  Is he trying to admit that multi-racialism is a problem because it causes people to make choices based on racial loyalty instead of on qualifications?  I don&rsquo;t think so.  I think he&rsquo;s just speaking his mind.</p>

			<p>McWhorter says he voted for Barack Obama because, &ldquo;I firmly believe that with Obama in the White House, people insisting that America is all about racism will have to rethink their message.&rdquo;<br>
Then he says he voted for Obama because &ldquo;of a red-blooded racial loyalty. I admit it.&rdquo;<br>
He&rsquo;s definitely a Quota &ldquo;Scholar&rdquo; at the Manhattan Institute. <br>

<p>Perhaps it will help <i>black</i> children look beyond race.</p>
<p>But the sleeping giant is waking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking beyond race&#8221; is a <i>vice</i> of power.</p>

			<p>I completely understand where he&rsquo;s coming from, and I agree with several of his premises. The one I find to be most true is where he states that he voted for Obama because race matters, but by electing a Black President, he hopes race will start to matter less. I think this is why Obama won so many White Votes. Obama was the first legitimate Black Candidate for the Presidency. He is a great speaker, and he tried to include Whites in his movement. We all know that the question of whether America would ever elect a Black President has been asked by virtually every American. I think that a lot of Whites simply decided that it was time. They voted for Obama, in a since, just to get it over with. America voted to end accusations of racism. Just wait till these Whites realize that you can&rsquo;t just vote away race pandering. </p>

			<p>&#8220;There is going to be a brother in the White House&#8221;. </p>
<p>Even blacks are smart enough to know that Obama hasn&rsquo;t got his crown, yet. He hasn&rsquo;t even been legally elected, yet. </p>
<p>The fun is going to start when the white man moves out of the big house and the black man moves in. Blacks know that the man what lives in the big house is &#8220;Master&#8221;. That&rsquo;s when I think things will start to get interesting.</p>

			<p>This man&rsquo;s thinking, like that of a lot of (most?) black folks, seems to be sadly confused. </p>
<p>First he says that two years ago he pointed out that if Obama were white, no one would consider him special. </p>
<p>So race mattered. </p>
<p>But he follows this statement with: &#8220;But as time went by, I realized that where the Obamenon was concerned, race did matter.&#8221; </p>
<p>Huh? First he thought race mattered, then he realized race mattered? Or is he saying that at first he thought race <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i> matter, and then changed his mind?</p>
<p><i>Race matters &mdash; yet his Presidency will make it matter less so.</i></p>
<p>What he means by this, on the other hand, is perfectly clear. Obama will make race mean less to whites, while it will mean just as much as ever to everyone else.</p>
<p>And the hypnosis of whites continues.</p>

<p>This one, rejuvenates me!</p>
<p>So there we have it, according to (the &#8220;now&#8221; openly Mau Mau Marxist)Comrade McWhorter, race does matter?</p>
<p>Thank you so very much, Comrade McWhorter; no one here, would have ever even guessed at that.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t about: taxes, terrorism, or trade; it is all about race!</p>
<p>Yep, &#8220;&hellip;there will be a black man riding in Air Force One. Like the Wicked Witch of the West,&#8221; that was yesterday; now, he hangs with all the rest: traitors, traitors, filthy Red traitors, deserve no less&hellip;</p>
<p>Well Comrade McWhorter, that does make a nice &#8220;pub song,&#8221; at the very least!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

The Obama Phenomenon  =  Blacks feel good about themselves, whites feel good about themselves. We all feel good.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s watch the economy tank and the country go down the tubes.</p>

<p>You &#8220;admit&#8221; what?  Are you a mulatto also?  That&rsquo;s the only way you could claim &#8220;red blooded racial loyalty.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re proud of him being an &#8220;African American,&#8221; are there any whites out there who should be proud that he&rsquo;s white?  Because, I mean, any smarts he has he owes to his mother, and she&rsquo;s the one that got his lazy butt out of bed in the morning and forced him to study.</p>
<p>But whether it&rsquo;s a white or black who&rsquo;s proud Obama is pres, hadn&rsquo;t we better wait to see if he screws up the country so bad he winds up as a one termer?</p>
<p>If that happens will you still be proud?</p>
<p>Too, if you write another column, can you make it a little more interesting and clever than the above, which reads like a high school student wrote it?</p>

			<p>I didn&rsquo;t know anyone considered John McWorter conservative, but he was probably tagged as one because he is, in fact, a highly intelligent and independent thinker.  He has never marched in lock step to the black marxist orthodoxy.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with racial loyalty and pride.  It is perfectly human to feel pride when one of your own makes it big.  I hope Whites are able to learn something from Professor McWorter.  But they&rsquo;re probably too scared.</p>
<p>I only wish our first black president could have been Thomas Sowell or Herman Cain.  We do, however, have to put aside race for a very important reason.  The marxist, socialist monster hides behind it.  That beast is an equal opportunity enslaver.  </p>

			<p>I am thrilled that this article was posted today. I hope this will convince some here that conservatism isn&rsquo;t our &#8220;great white hope&#8221; and never has been. Self-styled conservatives of all stripes may possess various ideas that are appealing to many of us - but many of them also possess ideas that are poison to out people! </p>
<p>Race is destiny, not political ideology! While I myself am politically conservative for the most part, I know well that most that call themsleves the &#8220;c&#8221; word, are no real ally of mine(or ours)when the future of our race is on the line. </p>
<p>In the wake of the embarrassing defeat to Obama, look to &#8220;conservatives&#8221; from every quarter to continue the slide leftward, as they see their political relevance slipping away. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve got from Russian media very like to have Obama leading the most powerful country of the world (so far!). It is not a secret for you, my friends. But&hellip; Do you have a question why? You have.</p>
<p>In Russia plus France, Germany, Italy and other developed European countries see clearly that after Bush America will be led DOWN!!! by a weak, unexperienced, ignorant, empty, well-tanned (S. Berluskoni&rsquo;s words)chatterbox to whom they have no respect whatsoever.</p>

			<p>      Thank you for your honesty, bro. I want to governed by<br>
Whites because I&rsquo;m White. The divide is absolute. Now, let&rsquo;s<br>
not hear any nonsense from you anymore about bringing people to-<br>
gether. Instead let&rsquo;s get together and divide up this country <br>
into fair portions for each race. Yes, it&rsquo;s unfair to Whites but<br>
who said life is fair? Whites have been stupid and now they will<br>
pay. Dividing up the country is getting off very lightly.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget all the unemployed whites who voted for Obama merely because they saw him as the better chance of improving their economic condition.  And, there are millions of them!</p>
<p>I voted for Clinton (the second term only) for this same reason even though I knew I was selling my soul.  We all are whores for our paychecks.<br>

			<p>I can tell you one thing.  If John McCain and Sarah Palin had won the election and a white reporter had written an article about how proud he/she was that a white man was going to be sitting in the White House and riding in Air Force One, he&rsquo;d be out of a job right now.</p>

			<p>HMMM, Mr Mcworter states he is no racist, however he was unable to print the first sentence before telling everyone his skin color. Watch any talk show and see how long it takes a black, or mulatto to do the same. America will [NEVER] recover from this election, if the super mulatto,s reign lasts any significant amount of time.  </p>

			<p>Black people used to be much more forthright about their race loyalties.  </p>
<p>Black folk who were pro-black (as opposed to pro-equality or pro-integration) were called &#8220;race men&#8221; and they were honestly and openly honored.  </p>
<p>For all his being treated as an Uncle Tom now, Booker T. Washington was not the white man&rsquo;s footstool, but a proud &#8220;race man&#8221; who knew that black folk would not advance unless they civilized and educated themselves and earned their right to equal treatment.</p>
<p>Further, he understood that race loyalty was a natural inclination of all human beings and said that he was naturally as proud of his race as the white man was proud of the white race.  </p>
<p>He did not deem either &#8220;pride&#8221; to be a bad thing.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, when Booker T. Washington spoke and worked for his race, was about the high point of racial common sense.<br>

			<p>McWhorter says he voted for Barack Obama because, &ldquo;I firmly believe that with Obama in the White House, people insisting that America is all about racism will have to rethink their message.&rdquo;<br>
Then he says he voted for Obama because &ldquo;of a red-blooded racial loyalty. I admit it.&rdquo;<br>
He&rsquo;s definitely a Quota &ldquo;Scholar&rdquo; at the Manhattan Institute. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m suspectible of even the &#8220;uncle tom&#8221; blacks or the &#8220;conservative blacks&#8221;.  I hate to say this, but I think lots of the conservative blacks, with the exception of Jesse Lee Peterson and Thomas Sowell, are just catering to white conservatives. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think this will wake up whites.  I mean, I can tell you from experience.  When more blacks and mexicans moved in, the crime went up.  I don&rsquo;t care why or how, but it did.  I can&rsquo;t believe whites fought off centuries of muslim invaders and other invading European countries, yet we voluntarily just lay down and give up our culture and power without a fight.  Shame.  </p>

			<p>What he first wrote sounds like color-blindness: Obama wouldn&rsquo;t have been considered if he was white, and therefore his nomination and election shows that we&rsquo;re not &#8220;over race&#8221; and we&rsquo;re still hung up on race.  We&rsquo;re using affirmative action to decide the presidency.  Then he says that&rsquo;s OK, because seeing a black man in the white house will help us be color blind because we will realize that we&rsquo;re all the same and a member of any race can become president - at least that what it seems like he&rsquo;s saying.  That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense though, because it&rsquo;s just trying to force the appearance of equality on the national consciousness when it doesn&rsquo;t exist in reality.  And that totally goes against the spirit of his other writing which pretty much says that if blacks want equality they have to work for it because the playing field has been leveled to a large degree.  And then he just says &#8220;well, who cares, I just like the idea of a brother in the white house.&#8221;  So then we&rsquo;re really not passed race at all if even he admits he bases preferences on race.  </p>

			<p>Yes, it seems Obama was elected president, but not by any state within a day&rsquo;s drive from here (Austin, Texas). The nearest state that voted for Obama is New Mexico (600 miles from here to the state line). (New Mexico and Colorado both voted for Obama and they are completely surrounded by McCain states.) The next nearest state was Florida (700 miles from here to the state line). And the next nearest state was Obama&rsquo;s home state of Illinois (800 miles from here to the state line). Between Texas and Canada, there are no states that voted for Obama. It is hard to get the impression that Obama won the election from where I stand&hellip;. unless you turn on the television. It certainly is no mandate from the voters of this part of the country.</p>

This is the double standard by which this country lives.  But I&rsquo;m glad to see that change is in the wind. We all know Obama will fail and this time only the MSM will be there to keep him propped up; that and his comatose followers.<br>

			<p>&#8220;One good thing about all of this is that blacks can no longer blame the white man for their condition. After all, don&rsquo;t we now have a black man in the White House ? They are going to sit back and expect the new president to hand them everything on a silver platter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, you and many like you don&rsquo;t have much experience with blacks, and have probably never lived in a black-run place.</p>
<p>Everything has to be 100% black ALL the time.  If anything goes wrong, (and all of it does) there is an invisible white conspiracy behind it.  Case closed, no more questions asked, and the black voters keep voting in the same screw-ups.  Confident, of course, that all will work out because their faithful leaders will root out this evil white behind the scenes manipulation to ruin.  </p>
<p>They continue to blame whites incessantly, long after there are no whites left to blame, and absolutely no explanation of how they could be blaming whites for whatever they scapegoat them for at the time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get it about them.  They seem to think we have magic powers, and that we are capable of constantly destroying their cities and their lives, even when we don&rsquo;t exist in their sphere.</p>

			<p>Yes, race mattered and even Rush Limbaugh can admit that.  But, for years Limbaugh, Ingraham and conservative talk radio pundits have been telling us that there are legions of so called black conservatives who look askance on racial entitlements and otherwise think just like the average beer swilling white person.  The results of the recent election have proven them to be the charlatans that they&rsquo;ve always been.  In fact some black conservatives were considering (and did) crossing party lines just to vote for a fellow black.</p>
<p>The Republican National Committee is now considering a black as chairman. The writing is on the wall.  Instead of moving to the right it appears Republicans will now start kissing up to blacks and Hispanics in the wrongheaded belief that that strategy will restore them to power.     <br>

			<p>I wonder if Mc Whorter would allow Whites to express  &#8220;red blooded racial loyalty&#8221; to one of our own, without us being called the dreaded R word in any matter of life? I somehow doubt it. But any well known White would be run out of polite society after all sorts of apologyies,grovelling, and begging ala the wretched Don Imus.Probably with Mc Worther leading the charge.                  </p>

He&rsquo;s a front man, that&rsquo;s all.  You have to look at WHO ARE HIS HANDLERS!!!   Who were his promoters over these past 15 years?  Who were  his sponsors?

<p>Yes. Clinton was a figurehead, someone to provide the voice and face of reassurance. He was supposed to just sit there and smile and make people feel good. His handlers made the mistake of believing they could leave him alone. The Lewinsky scandal put and end to the Clinton agenda. They won&rsquo;t make that mistake this time around. If Obama needs extramarital relief, you can be sure his handlers will provide him with partners who are carefully selected and easily controlled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Obama is re-constructing the Clinton White House staff along with new extremists. Meet the new boss same as the old boss or at least the same handlers behind the scene. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The queasiness is because, in my heart of hearts, there is a part of me that thrills to the Obamas because of a red-blooded racial loyalty. There. I admit it.&rdquo; (McWhorter&rsquo;s statement above)</p>
<p>Ice:  &#8220;You &ldquo;admit&rdquo; what? Are you a mulatto also? That&rsquo;s the only way you could claim &ldquo;red blooded racial loyalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re proud of him being an &ldquo;African American,&rdquo; are there any whites out there who should be proud that he&rsquo;s white? Because, I mean, any smarts he has he owes to his mother, and she&rsquo;s the one that got his lazy butt out of bed in the morning and forced him to study.&#8221;<br>
Posted by ice at 7:49 PM on November 14 </p>
<p>Actually, ice, McWhorter is probably a mulatto,  His skin tone is much lighter than average, and he is one of the few blacks who can write a pretty good article.</p>
<p>But as you pointed out, he shares no more &#8220;blood&#8221; with Obama than the average white, since Obama&rsquo;s mother was white.  None of the pundits are pointing that out.  If they did the blacks would be livid.</p>
<p>Obama is well above the average black, but he&rsquo;s far from exceptional in white terms.  Jack Cashill, plus a half dozen other experts, have proven unequivocally that a white man, William Ayers, wrote his book, Dreams from My Father,&#8221; or whatever it was entitled.  Reading the book it&rsquo;s possible to tell which parts Obama wrote because of the errors and undeveloped, immature style of phraseology.</p>
<p>Once again black arrogance can&rsquo;t be contained, and they&rsquo;re looking foolish one more time.  LOL!</p>

			<p>I have news for the people who supported Obama for President. Unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, America is still a free enough nation that any American who doesn&rsquo;t want to support Obama, doesn&rsquo;t have to.  Afterall, the ground rules for this sentiment were created by the liberals,when,in Bush&rsquo;s 2000 election win against Gore, before 9/11 and before any action in Iraq, many, many, liberals immediately announced that Bush isn&rsquo;t &#8220;their&#8221; President. Some in the Hollywood crowd even claimed they were going to leave the country, which of course they never did.</p>

<p>I get the disgust about some Whites who get confused about race and politics and other matters in our society and who in their confusion start accepting non-Whites who &#8220;think White,&#8221; or who &#8220;think Conservative,&#8221; as compadres.

<p> The impression I get from the Russian media is that the election of Obama is a sign the United States is in decline. After all, Putin didn&rsquo;t even bother to send a greeting to the new president. I don&rsquo;t see much of a change in foriegn relations under an Obama presidency.

			<p>Dear Dr. McWhorter:</p>
<p>I read your book &#8220;Losing the Race&#8221;, in which you took some rather controversial positions (but no more so than those taken by Juan Williams and Bill Cosby), and I never counted you among the ranks of conservatives.  I always knew you were a liberal, just one who showed a little more common sense than the race hustlers of the Sharpton/Jackson variety.  </p>
<p>So it comes as no surprise to me that you would (justifiably, in my opinion) celebrate the election of B. Hussein Obama as President of the United States.  That you would do so reminds me of the old joke about the Lone Ranger with Tonto&rsquo;s punchline &#8220;What you mean WE, kimosabe?&#8221;  </p>
<p>On the other hand, can you really say that you are proud that the first black president (even a strongly liberal one) would be someone of such negligible background and accomplishment?  Truly the first Affirmative Action president.  </p>
<p>By the way, how&rsquo;s that opera singer gig working out?</p>
<p>Tsk, tsk.</p>

<p>In a sane, just world, this fraud, along with MLK and Alex Haley would be fully exposed on the front pages of the world press and all the &#8216;alphabet&rsquo; networks, laughed at, mocked, debased and exposed for the charlatans they are.</p>
<p>More good reason to shun the networks and lamestream presses.<br>
 <br>
From the links:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The emergence of a previously unseen writing sample proves all but conclusively that Barack Obama did not in any meaningful way write &#8216;Dreams from My Father,&rsquo; the book Time Magazine has called &#8216;the best-written memoir ever produced by an American politician.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Obama contributed a chapter, titled: &#8216;Why Organize? Problems and Promise in the Inner City.&rsquo;  [The essay is] without a hint of style, sophistication or promise.</p>
<p>Indeed, the essay is clunky, pedestrian and wonkish – a B- paper in a freshman comp class&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It is as if a high 90s golfer suddenly showed up with his PGA card – with no known practice rounds in between. We will be happy to show these early examples [of obama&rsquo;s writing] to anyone who cares to see them.</p>
<p>The Obama camp has refused all inquiries on grades, SAT scores, LSAT scores, student theses, or any other documents that would flesh out what Politico calls Obama&rsquo;s &#8216;scant paper trail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Despite being named president of the Harvard Law Review – more of a popularity than a literary contest – Obama has, most unusually, written nothing under his own name for the HLR or any other legal journal&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is infuriating is excerpts from &#8216;Dreams&rsquo; is showing up in high school textbooks along side the plagiarized excerpts from &#8216;Roots&rsquo; and &#8216;I Have a Dream.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jack Cashill is a national treasure doing yeoman&rsquo;s work  &mdash;  little noticed, it seems in the biased press.</p>

Let me add my gratitude to Bon&rsquo;s.  Many thanks to our anonymous poster for those links!  I was extremely impressed by Dr. Cashill&rsquo;s scholarly  and  precise analysis;  after reading it I am fully convinced that Obama&rsquo;s work is bogus and a fraud.</p>
<p>Well, Bill Ayers didn&rsquo;t make it to Washington himself, but he (and Bernadine Dorhn) will now have a surrogate and protégé sitting in the White House in their stead. Practically the same thing. From bomber to president maker!  Life is strange.        <br>

			<p>I was frequently and fervently polled by my friends, family, and co-workers before the election - doubtless like many (perhaps most) of you.  When asked if I was going to vote Obama, I replied calmly that &#8220;I only vote for White candidates.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The reactions I received to this simple comment ranged from the angry to the absurdly comic.  Several accused me of racism, to which I replied &#8220;If I were Black, and said I only voted for Black candidates, you wouldn&rsquo;t say a word, would you?  So what&rsquo;s the difference?&#8221;</p>
<p>The difference, it turns out, is that in the minds of many folks from all walks of life, it is considered &#8220;unsportsmanlike&#8221; for Whites to press their numerical advantage.  Other groups, e.g. NAACP, La Raza etc, can shamelessly and openly advocate for their people&rsquo;s interests, but Whites cannot.  For the minority groups, such group-focused behavior seems to be a fair tactic for the underdog to battle the entrenched majority, but the majority of course is expected to fight with one hand tied behind its back and give the minority groups every opportunity to win.</p>
<p>When challenged as to how this benefits themselves, their children and future descendants, or their people in general, few can give a coherent response.  Their arguments boil down in essence to &#8220;Well, it&rsquo;s just not fair for Whites to group together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fair?  We&rsquo;re talking about control of our nation and our destinies here.  I have no inclination at all to worry about being &#8220;fair&#8221;.  I want to win, on honorable terms using the same tactics that are acceptable for use by other groups competing for the same goal.  I would not willingly accept any handicap to my people&rsquo;s advancement and retention of control of our great nation.  What sane person would? </p>
