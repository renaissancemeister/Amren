			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Caroline Graham, Daily Mail (London), November 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>She is already a superstar, but now Beyonce Knowles wants to be a superhero &mdash; as the first black Wonder Woman.</p>
<p>And she has likened landing the role to the election of Barack Obama, whose campaign she backed.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old has met executives at DC Comics and Warner Brothers, who own the rights to the iconic figure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beyonce, whose acting career has included  a comic turn in Austin Powers In Goldmember and a Diana Ross-type character in Dreamgirls, says she is ready to camp it up in Wonder Woman&rsquo;s red, white and blue swimsuit.</p>
<p>She put on 20lb to play soul sensation Etta James in Cadillac Records, and admitted the suit would be unforgiving of any extra weight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Beyonce is a fairly attractive, part-African woman, but Superwoman material, she ain&rsquo;t. Lynda Carter would be a hard act for any woman to follow, but it&rsquo;s NOT a role for any black or partly black woman.</p>

		<p>The lesson here is that blacks want superheroes that look like them.  They are too unoriginal to create their own, so they have to co-opt traditional white heroes like Superman, Wonder Woman and James Bond.  If they get their wish, and they probably will, the antagonists in the movies will undoubtedly be white people with nordic features or &#8220;redneck&#8221; characters who will simply be no match for the wit, intelligence and physical strength of the black superheroes.  </p>
<p>Whites need to get used to the fact that they are officially behind enemy lines in America and things are likely to get worse before the get better.  If, that is, they ever get better.  </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s fine, Beyonce.  Get your boyfriend, Dr. Dre, to finance it, and watch him the lose tens of millions of dollars that he &#8216;earned&rsquo; producing rap music that denigrated white culture and values.  That would be poetic justice.</p>
<p>And a word of advice to Dr. Dre, from Ice Cube, one of Dre&rsquo;s own Frankenstein creations, &#8220;Run outa money, and watch your heart break.&#8221;   Beyonce will drop you, Dre, as Ice Cube said on one of your own albums, &#8220;like a bad habit.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Beyonce is just playing for a racial power grab.  I think she figures they won&rsquo;t refuse her the role because it would be considered racist.  I can&rsquo;t imagine DC Comics or Warner Brothers giving her the role simply because this movie has the potential of being a big box office success and casting her in the role will guarantee it goes to DVD overnight.  Remember Halle Berry as Catwoman?  </p>

		<p>If she wants to be a black wonder women, fine.  But no one owes her the job.  If she was really smart she&rsquo;d either create or commission an original black female super hero story.  That would be worthy of respect. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of producing a movie about the life of Nelson Mandela.  I&rsquo;m going to have Rush Limbaugh in the starring role.  Do you think anyone will mind?  I&rsquo;m sure those pushing for a black James Bond would not mind a bit.</p>

		<p>I would say the way to teach these blacks a thing or two is for whites to start taking over black cultural icons, but then it hit me: there <i>are</i> no black cultural icons worth taking over! What have blacks created that equals a Superman or a Dick Tracy or a Snow White or a Pinocchio? Nothing. Blacks have excelled in sports and music and that&rsquo;s about it. As far as creating these lovable, enduring characters that have endured through the years, blacks have shown little talent (like in a lot of areas). So they have to try to take over white cultural icons. And if we don&rsquo;t like it we must be racist.</p>

		<p>I had Wonder Woman under-roos when I was young. I wish I had a pair today. I have a white t-shirt today with her picture on it. There&rsquo;s no comparison. </p>
<p>Black women like Beyonce are attractive. But, they die for that white-type hair, slim bodies of attractive white females, and positions that are headed by whites. The second any project is headed primarily by blacks they&rsquo;ll be running back to the white creators who gave them the good life. </p>

		<p>Would anyone find it acceptable if there was a White guy playing Shaft? Or a White actor taking the role of Kato? Of course not. Why do White people even allow Blacks to try to replace classic White characters? Look how bad the movies that did this have all flopped. The Wild Wild West, Catwoman, The Honeymooners - all box office and critical duds. White people need to stand up and demand respect for classic American characters. I&rsquo;m ashamed that this is even allowed to happen.</p>

		<p>folks, we need to be careful here too I&rsquo;m afraid. First of all Lynda Carter is half Mexican. Now I am not putting her down, but we need to find out where she stands. I am willing to bet she is pro Obama thus pro black wonder woman.  </p>
<p>If people want to start seeing different faces, why not a Chinese wonder woman? Oh, Nope, the Chinese have their own heroes and have made great films of them. Let&rsquo;s see, a native American, nah, most American Indians tilt to whites on issues like this.<br>
I know, blacks can&rsquo;t make their own heroes so they have to use ours.<br>
How much you want to bet the bad guys are going to be white?</p>

		<p>This is the kind of tripe that reinforces people&rsquo;s views of blacks as inferior.  Why can&rsquo;t they create their own heroes?  Lynda Carter was an absolutely beautiful woman even without makeup and her what&rsquo;s more her features were real.  Without makeup, photoshop tricks and a lace wig to cover her nappy hair, which by the way is damaged by too many relaxers, she&rsquo;s a typical black woman.  Although I will give her credit for keeping herself in shape.</p>

		<p>No, this would not work.Wonder babe is a greek character. I would cast Eliza Dusku or Shannon Dorety, before I would cast Beyonce in this role. Find another comic book character, but I warn you, it will be hard. Helle&rsquo;s catwoman bombed and she is atleast an experienced actress.</p>

<p>I actually liked that movie even though the critics savaged it. A number of these more recent &#8216;white&rsquo; movies staring black actors have been trashed by the critics. I can almost see the black movie audience now. . expecting to celebrate too about the theater. . only to be left confused and empty handed by the official word of the critics. There is a greater force in America that even blacks must bow down to: Hollywood. </p>

		<p>If Hollyweird wants to dump millions of dollars into making a black Wonder Woman, then let them.  Maybe when they keep losing millions on these films, they might get the picture (no pun intended).</p>
<p>But I doubt it because ideology trumps money everytime.  And besides pushing the gay issue on everybody, Hollywood does everything it can to promote blacks in film to the extent that you have look really, really hard to find a white good guy.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re not going to cast Beyonce Knowles for the simple reason that all of these black lead films bomb.  If I&rsquo;m wrong and it&rsquo;s not about money, maybe they will, but I don&rsquo;t think so.  This movie has been in the works for years now and the last director on it, I think his name was Whedon, was planning on re-designing her costume so that it didn&rsquo;t resemble the American flag!!!!!?????  Whedon is a gay activist who grew up in a single parent household and hates America because he&rsquo;s not allowed to marry another man.  I don&rsquo;t know if the current director will follow through or not but this is Hollywood we&rsquo;re talking about.  Whatever actress is cast in the role, I can pretty much assume it won&rsquo;t be the same patriotic superheroine from the comic books.</p>

<p>Excellent post, Dave.  You have it right on.</p>
<p>I just might add that it isn&rsquo;t just their entertainment idols that they require to look like them, (although I&rsquo;m a bit hard-pressed to see how even a mentally challenged black can think they look like Beyonce, when, to me, she looks more white than black)they require everyone to look black, including Jesus, and he&rsquo;s depicted in many of their churches as being a stereotypical black with an afro.  Get a load of the image on Trinity United Church, as an example.</p>
<p>Hispanics to a degree are the same way.</p>
<p>Non-whites, especially blacks, say that whites have always depicted Jesus as a fair-haired, blue-eyed person, although I&rsquo;m at a loss to remember any Jesus icons in my life in any white church that looked like anything but a Semitic Caucasoid.  Fair-haired and blue eyes is something I must have missed, although it&rsquo;s a distinct ossibility more so than black, because the Europeans inundated the Mediterranean by the millions beginning about 5000 B.C.<br>

		<p>The nerve of this woman.  The role has already been cast for Megan Gale, a hot Australian supermodel.  Beyonce figured she could march over to Warner Brothers and play on White guilt or worse, accuse them of racism if they don&rsquo;t cave.  Of course, they&rsquo;ll placate her by giving her another part in some movie.  Better make it something low budget if they hope to recoup their losses.  </p>

		<p>Well.sadly it&rsquo;s all over. Rap was bad enough.The past 20 years every strata of society is overrepresented by blacks.Whites are the villains and blacks the presidents in movies and tv.Now,the fiction is translated into real life with Obama and all the black celebrities getting whatever they want through strongarming da man with threats of racism.That&rsquo;s how race hustlers make their bread.Easier than earning it.Spike Lee can&rsquo;t direct his way out of a paper box.But he can threaten whitey for money to produce and direct movies.                <a href="https://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2008/10/real-mark-to-market.html" rel="nofollow">https://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2008/10/real-mark-to-market.html</a>        </p>

		<p>As someone who used to read a great deal of comics, I can&rsquo;t recall ever seeing a black kid in the comics store.  There aren&rsquo;t any major black superheroes in the DC Universe.  All the heavyweights in the Justice League are either all White or aliens.  When they created that Justice League cartoon for television they picked a minor black character John Stewart to play the Green Lantern to add some diversity to it.  In actuality, the Green Lantern is a White guy named Hal Jordan.  There&rsquo;s a good reason for all this lack of diversity.  Blacks don&rsquo;t read comic books so why should the industry cater to them?  Beyonce is out of her league here and if she got the part she would destroy the franchise.  I suggest a TV &#8220;Movie of the Week&#8221; where she plays a promiscuous woman who&rsquo;s slept with multiple partners and contracts AIDS.  She ends up turning her life around and preaching to the black community about safe sex.  That or get a part in a new Blackula film.</p>

		<p>Great comments by all, as usual.  I&rsquo;ll only add that, in my opinion, Beyonce Knowles has no discernible impressive talent.  A hype creation.  Her singing on recordings is cleaned up with protools, or lip-synched in a &#8220;live&#8221; situation.  As far as the leap to &#8220;movie actress&#8221;, that seems absurd.  Is she really an actress at all?  Please don&rsquo;t compare her to Halle Berry, who, like her or not, has logged countless hours of screen time in many, many pro productions.  Beyonce is more like a &#8220;black&#8221; Britney Spears, without the papparazzi.</p>

<p>  I tend to agree with you. Most blacks seem uninterested in comics. The comic book industry like all publishing is only interested in the bottom line. If blacks were reading comics in their millions, we would see dozens of black superheros. Why not create a new superhero character for Beyonce? Didn&rsquo;t they do that for Will Smith?</p>

		<p>Beyonce is forever held up as the epitome of black beauty these days. Even though her look is that of a light skinned black woman, with Caucasian features and long flowing hair, old pictures reveal how her old ethnic nose was thinned out surgically, and by now almost everyone knows she wears lacefront wigs, and that the hair in them were grown by non-black women. And although some say she has a great body, I really don&rsquo;t agree, like many in the business she has had breast implants, but her legs are still thick and unattractive, and her waist isn&rsquo;t especially trim. Lynda Carter face and hair were her own, and her body was naturally hourglass in shape. She was far more beautiful than Beyonce could ever hope to be.</p>

		<p>Beyonce Knowles already believes herself to be some mythical superheroine in real life. She believes she is transformed when she walks onstage and becomes Sasha Fierce, and has now asked to be recognized professionally by that name. Personally, I think she is slightly mental, and obviously incredibly egotistical. But if she wants to do a movie about a fictional superhero, why not make a movie about her alter-ego instead? The character of Wonderwoman was always depicted as being white skinned, blue eyed, with long wavy dark hair and a wasp waist. Beyonce or Sasha has none of the attributes naturally. In the 70&rsquo;s when Christopher Reeves was cast as Superman he was an ideal choice, since he fit the character to a T visually. Today, they would likely insist on some black rapper in the role.</p>

		<p>If she is regrettably cast in the role I would prefer the movie didn&rsquo;t resemble the DC comics character in much the same way they cast Cathy Lee Crosby in that 1974 abomination.  Or the way the &#8220;Wizard of Oz&#8221; was turned into the &#8220;Wiz&#8221;.  It could be called &#8220;Wonda&#8221; with Beyonce in leopard skin tights, hoop earrings, black beret and a rhinestone studded belt with a giant &#8220;W&#8221; on it.  The plot could go along the lines of &#8220;West Side Story&#8221; with most of the scenes full of dancing and rap music.  It could be the first rap musical out of Hollywood.</p>

		<p>There is way too much black everything in entertainment these days.  Movies coming out of Hollywood with an all White cast are becoming extinct.  If it&rsquo;s not a black lead then there are black supporting characters, even in the most ridiculous situations like Westerns.  When the movie is finished, nine times out of ten there is a hip hop song playing in the closing credits.  It&rsquo;s not just the black culture in movies either.  There are subtle and sometimes not so subtle anti-White, pro-homosexual, anti-Christian messages in way too many of these films.  I seldom take my family to the movies anymore.  Television is the same way.  I now restrict my viewing to just a few channels like TCM or Discovery.  Many movies produced before 1990 are the only things palatable to my senses.  </p>

<p>Beyonce is no Diahann Carroll nor is she Lena Horne, let alone the truly talented White actresses, Katherine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Lynda Carter, Catherine Zeta-Jones, etc.</p>
<p>Liv Tyler is perfect for the role of Wonder Woman.  She fits the type aesthetically and she&rsquo;s a good actress.  I say give Miss Tyler a fighting chance to play Wonder Woman, not some untalented hip hop wonder such as Beyonce.</p>

<p>Certainly not fat, but hardly built like Wonder Woman. And since she has recently gained 20 pounds more for her last role, she is looking even more zaftig of late. </p>
