<h1>Obama&rsquo;s Aunt Illegal Immigrant</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Nov. 1, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama said Saturday he didn&rsquo;t know his aunt was living in the United States illegally and believes that laws covering the situation should be followed.</p>
<p>The Associated Press found that Obama&rsquo;s aunt had been instructed to leave the country four years ago by an immigration judge who rejected her request for asylum from her native Kenya. The woman, Zeituni Onyango (zay-TUHN on-YANG-oh), is living in public housing in Boston and is the half-sister of Obama&rsquo;s late father.</p>
<p>A statement given to the AP by Obama&rsquo;s campaign said, &ldquo;Senator Obama has no knowledge of her status but obviously believes that any and all appropriate laws be followed.&rdquo; Traveling with Obama in Nevada, campaign strategist David Axelrod declined to elaborate on the statement, but said: &ldquo;I think people are suspicious about stories that surface in the last 72 hours of a national campaign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The campaign said it was returning $260 that Onyango had contributed in small increments to Obama&rsquo;s presidential bid over several months. Federal election law prohibits foreigners from making political donations. Onyango listed her employer as the Boston Housing Authority and last gave $5 on Sept. 19.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama was raised for the most part by his mother and her parents in Hawaii. He first met his father&rsquo;s side of the family when he traveled to Africa 20 years ago. He referred to Onyango as &ldquo;Auntie Zeituni&rdquo; when describing the trip in his memoir, saying she was &ldquo;a proud woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s campaign said he had seen her a few times since that meeting, beginning with a return trip to Kenya with his future wife, Michelle, in 1992. Onyango visited the family in Chicago on a tourist visa at Obama&rsquo;s invitation about nine years ago, the campaign said, stopping to visit friends on the East Coast before returning to Kenya.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Onyango&rsquo;s refusal to leave the country would represent an administrative, noncriminal violation of immigration law, meaning such cases are handled outside the criminal court system. Estimates vary, but many experts believe there are more than 10 million such immigrants in the U.S.</p>
<p>The AP could not immediately reach Onyango for comment. When a reporter went to her home Friday night, no one answered the door. A neighbor said she was often not home on weekends. Onyango did not immediately return telephone and written messages left at her home.</p>
<p>Onyango was instructed to leave the country by a U.S. immigration judge who denied her asylum request, a person familiar with the matter told the AP. This person spoke on condition of anonymity because no one was authorized to discuss Onyango&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>It was unclear why her request was rejected in 2004. A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Kelly Nantel, said the government does not comment on an individual&rsquo;s citizenship status or immigration case.</p>
<p>Information about the deportation case was disclosed and confirmed by two separate sources, one a federal law enforcement official. The information they made available is known to officials in the federal government, but the AP could not establish whether anyone at a political level in the Bush administration or in the McCain campaign had been involved in its release.</p>
<p>Onyango&rsquo;s case &mdash; coming to light just days before the presidential election &mdash; led to an unusual nationwide directive within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requiring that any deportations before Tuesday&rsquo;s election be approved at least at the level of the agency&rsquo;s regional directors, the U.S. law enforcement official told the AP.</p>
<p>The directive suggests that the administration is sensitive to the political implications of Onyango&rsquo;s case coming to light so close to the election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Boston, Lydia Agro, communications director for the Housing Authority, said Onyango had been screened and approved for public housing as an &ldquo;eligible non-citizen&rdquo; when she moved in in 2003. She said the authority is not notified of deportation orders and did not know Onyango was related to Obama until two days ago.<br>

						</p>
											<p>Senator Barack Obama&rsquo;s relatives have congregated at Nyangoma Kogelo village and will remain together until after Tuesday&rsquo;s US presidential elections. </p>
<p>They have set aside a bull to slaughter in celebration should the Illinois senator whose father was Kenyan win, according to family spokesperson Mr Malik Abongo.<br>

			<p>What did Obama not know and when did he not know it?</p>
<p>Of course Obama didn&rsquo;t know his pastor of 20 years, the &#8220;Rev&#8221;. Wright was a racist so it is possible he didn&rsquo;t know his aunt was living in squalor.</p>
<p>I boldly predict she won&rsquo;t be deported.</p>

			<p>An illegal alien living in public housing while native born Americans are homeless or spending 60 percent of their income on rent.</p>
<p>What a country.  Time for a revolution.</p>
<p>This slug is also on SSI, disability courtesy of the taxpayers.</p>
<p>The only White Americans can get disability even if they are in a wheel chair is to hire an attorney and go through a lengthy appeals process.  If the attorney wins, the attorney gets 25 percent of the disability payment.  The deduction is made by the social security office before disbursing the remaining monthly payment to the receipient.</p>
<p>Whites are always, always turned down for disability when they first apply.  </p>

			<p>Even foreigners are eligible for public housing. I wonder how many white men live in public housing in Boston, or do they have to sleep on the street? Surely if &#8216;diversity&rsquo; is such a good thing and the city of Boston is making every effort to not discriminate, surely these same social workers can make an effort to put homeless white men in public housing.</p>

			<p>Of course no one asks, including the author of this article, whether Obama&rsquo;s having an illegal relative in this country might possibly, just with a teensy-weensy bit of reaching, you know, conceivably bias Obama&rsquo;s stance on the illegal immigration issue. I know, call me crazy for even suggesting it.</p>
<p>The article scarcely even mentions this conflict of interest  &mdash;  a very troubling one at that. No, I take that back. The article makes NO reference to it at all. The writer could have talked to Republican spokespeople who would gladly have pointed out the political implications.  But no, we can&rsquo;t have that now, can we?</p>
<p>Yet, the last four paragraphs of this excerpt all make reference to the fact that this embarassment has come to light in just the past few days, implying that this could be due to the McCain campaign. In other words, the biggest concern here is NOT Obama&rsquo;s impartiality or lack thereof, but simply whether Republican &#8220;dirty tricks&#8221; were involved! </p>
<p>The media so desperately wants Obama to win that it will downplay any story or fact that casts him in a negative light, no matter how injurious it could be to this nation.</p>

			<p>Obama lied; campaign kept tabs on aunt and other relatives for months. Mass. Governor Deval Patrick cooperated with Obama as to checking on relatives illegally in the state.</p>
<p>Aunt Zeituni&rsquo;s Protectors<br>
American Spectator ^ | November 30, 2008 | The Prowler </p>
<p>Posted on Monday, November 03, 2008 7:00:01 PM by PBRCat</p>
<p>ALL IN THE FAMILY Senior aides to Sen. Barack Obama and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick were aware that Obama&rsquo;s aunt, Zeituni Onyango, was living in the United States illegally and in a South Boston public-housing project, and were monitoring her at the request of senior Obama campaign officials, according to a current employee for Obama&rsquo;s key political consulting firm, AKP&D; Message and Media. </p>
<p>Back in early 2007, as Obama&rsquo;s chief campaign strategist David Axelrod was organizing and planning the Obama campaign, he identified Obama&rsquo;s unique family situation   &mdash;   a number of half-brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, some living overseas   &mdash;   as a potential problem, says an employee for Axelrod&rsquo;s political consulting firm, and who has done work on the Obama campaign.</p>

			<p>Not only was she an illegal immigrant, she was living in public housing.  Why must Americans build public, low-rent housing for those who are not citizens?  And this has been going on for years, for reports emerged decades ago that whole public housing projects in NYC were housing illegals.  Liberal Democrats, Liberal Republicans, the result is the same: give preferences and privileges for all except native-born white Americans.  &mdash;    &mdash;  HM</p>

			<p>I guess when a person applies for government housing there is no requirement to prove he/she is here legally! Get use to such travesties if Obama wins.  Isn&rsquo;t it strange that it is unlawful to disclose that a person is here illegally.  I guess the Feds don&rsquo;t wnat us to take the law into our own hands and kick people out.  Not to worry  &mdash;  we are too apathtic to do anything.</p>

			<p>Kenya, Barack Obama&rsquo;s ancestral country, currently has a population of 38 million. I&rsquo;d bet 2 month&rsquo;s pay that by the end of Obama&rsquo;s 4 years a fair portion of that population has relocated to the United States - 5% at least - and receives the Democratic Party&rsquo;s amnesty. It would be a bigger percentage than that, except that most Kenyans can&rsquo;t afford the airplane ride. Obama will probably also pressure Europe diplomatically (or militarily, through threat of abolishing NATO) to take in tens of millions of African &#8220;refugees&#8221; and boat people. We&rsquo;re about to see the African population in the West soar dramatically.</p>
<p>Can I also make another suggestion, to whoever approves comments here at Amren: Regardless of who wins, put up a predictions page to see what Amreners think will happen over the next 4 years. Keep each prediction short and sweet - 2-3 sentences each, tops.</p>

			<p>Everything is upset down in this country.  In the interest of diversity, tolerance and multiculturalism, we have the following:</p>
<p>1.  If you are an illegal alien from anywhere in the world and you want to attend college in any of the 50 states, you can get free money from the taxpayers to do so and not pay a dime extra in out-of-state tuition.  However, if you are a white kid with a perfect GPA and perfect SAT scores, living in Tennessee and you want to attend Duke University in North Carolina, you will have to wait your turn behind minorities, women and foreign students.  Whatever percentage is left to the white kids and if you do manage to get accepted, you will pay huge out-of-state fees.  You&rsquo;ll also be made to take bogus diversity and multicultural courses in order to make you a well-rounded student.</p>
<p>2.  If you are an illegal alien, indigent, not working, homeless, drug addict or a deadbeat alcoholic, you can walk into any hospital in this country and they must provide you with health care at no cost to you.  But if you are a working citizen, who has no healthcare and you walk into any emergency room in this country, you will pay anywhere from $200.00 to $500.00 in emergency room costs.  And if you don&rsquo;t pay those costs within a certain time, they will turn it over to a collection agency.  Still no payment, they will file a lawsuit against you and get a judgment. Next step- garnish your wages until the amount is paid in full.  Your only relief is to pay the bill or file for bankruptcy.  No skirting healthcare payments if you&rsquo;re white.</p>
<p>3.  If you are an illegal alien, driving an uninsured vehicle and have no license and you are stopped by the police, they have to let you go.  If you are involved in an accident, the worse that will happen is they will lock you up but be forced to let you go.  If you are a legal citizen, driving the only vehicle you have to get you back and forth to your job and you don&rsquo;t have insurance and you are involved in an accident, you could be thrown in jail, made to pay all kinds of fines and be sued by the other person&rsquo;s insurance company.  Your only relief is to pay the damages or file for bankruptcy to have the debt discharged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great country we live in isn&rsquo;t it?  Well it used to be and it&rsquo;s only going to get worse after this election.  Just wait and see.</p>

<p><br>
And I predict that at the end of Obama&rsquo;s 4 years, Kenya which has one of the world&rsquo;s highest birth rates (if not the highest), will have a much larger population than the present 38 million   &mdash;    even despite all the millions that will have come here.</p>

<p>With all due respect, Gayle, Duke U is a private school. I&rsquo;d have to doubt it has any &#8220;out-of-state&#8221; fees.</p>
<p>The more pertinent question is why whites go to the back of the line of schools like Duke founded and built up by <i>their</i> race.</p>
<p>Insanity is the obvious, and probably correct, answer.</p>
