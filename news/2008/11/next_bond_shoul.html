				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Indian Express (New Delhi), November 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Following the historic victory of Barack Obama in the US Presidential elections, Daniel Craig says the world should be prepared to see a &lsquo;coloured 007&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old, who was himself the target of much criticism for being the first &lsquo;blonde Bond&rsquo;, humoured the idea at a press conference before the Italian premier of his latest Bond film, &lsquo;Quantum of Solace&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;After Barack Obama&#8221;s victory I think we might have reached the moment for a coloured 007,&#8221; the &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; quoted him as telling the Agi news agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the role could easily be played by a black actor, because the character created by Ian Fleming in the Fifties has undergone a great deal of evolution and continues to be updated.&#8221;<br>

			<p>I must admit I liked Carl Weathers? as Action Jackson back in the late `70&#8220;s. My favorite scene was when a crack wino stirs his head from the gutter after hearing a police siren and goes, &#8220;Say! If that`s for me, don`t answer it!!&#8221; </p>

			<p>Fleming describes Bond as a white Englishman with black hair and blue eyes. </p>
<p>If they want to make a movie about a black spy, create a black character and write a script.<br>
A recent movie, Traitor, starred Don Cheadle as a triple agent.  It was a good spy movie thriller.  </p>
<p>By the way, do not go to see Quantum of Solace.  The bad guys are evil white American CIA agents who want to destroy Bolivia.  The hero who saves Bond is named Felix Leiter. In the books Felix is described as blond.  But this Felix is a black American.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similiar to all those commericals where the stupid white guy can&rsquo;t figure out what kind of orange juice to buy until a black advises him.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And let&rsquo;s have a black Superman, too. &#8220;</p>
<p>Actually, one of the commie throwaway newspapers in my city has a picture of Obama on the cover in a superman costume.  It is not a joke, they are serious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than those votive candles of Obama in a saint&rsquo;s outfit his worshippers were selling in San Francisco.</p>

			<p>Okay, thats fine. But let&rsquo;s have a white John Henry, a white Shaft, a white Fat Albert, and so on.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, how about they redo that movie &#8220;The Wiz,&#8221; but retell the story using a white cast!</p>

			<p>Why not have a white Kunta Kinte?</p>
<p>There is very little chance of a Black Bond film; the franchise is all about making money and the magic formula doesn&rsquo;t include some monkey in a suit blowing up bad guys.</p>
<p>Daniel Craig is an excellent actor and I hope he has many more films to come.</p>

			<p>A Black President, leads them to suggest we need a Black Pope, and a Black James Bond? Meanwhile, Italy devoted an entire issue of Vogue to black models. And for the last 2 decades western media has been saturated and dominated by black thug culture, in the form of rap music and baggy gangsta style clothing. It seems the west is eager to put paint a new black face on everything that once represented white culture. All too ironic given what has taken place in Zimbabwe, with the murders and ethnic cleansings that have taken place upon white farmers, and which are continuing in South Africa. The worst more poorly get treated in Africa, the more they embrace black culture in the west. How perverse and suicidal is that?</p>

Whenever I read proposals such as this, I&rsquo;m reminded how little originality there is in black culture.</p>
<p>Their modus operandi appears to be to co-opt the ideas of other people and claim them as orginal.</p>

			<p>The dellusional misguided whites continue to threaten the icons that we have by letting 007 be black in the future?  I don&rsquo;t want a 007 movie to be like a movie on BET.  People&rsquo;s notion and multiculturism, diversity and other garbage they bring forth will continue to ruin this once great nation.  The White nationalists need to bring this country back to what it was founded upon.</p>

			<p>Well, the CIA agent-Felix Leiter-character in the old Bond movies was a white guy. He has now been magically turned into a black guy. If they ever make a Bond movie with Bond as a black male, this franchise will have definitely jumped the shark and it would be time to end it. </p>

<p>I am loving it&hellip;..only reverse psychology and help free us from the affirmative action monster. Keep it coming. I tell you when white people start demanding all these things in reverse it will be a different ball-game and bring an end to the non-sense. </p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a novel idea for all AR readers to consider!</p>
<p>Join with me and refuse to pay another nickel of our hard-earned<br>
money to see or rent or buy any more movies that feature Daniel Craig, Bond or otherwise.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s send a message to our fellow whites in Hollywood.</p>
<p>These actors and actresses of our race have an obligation to present positive, healthy, and uplifting role models for their<br>
fans - and when they stop doing so, we need to help end their careers.</p>
<p>Sound good?</p>

<p>Black, Indian (speaking English with Indian accent) muslim Jamalprindi Bond. Suitable for future generations of black muslim brits I think.</p>

			<p>This stuff is all so stupid.  I haven&rsquo;t gone to see a Bond movie since Sean Connery played him in Goldfinger.  I always avoid any movies now that have stupid or evil whites and brave, smart black saviors.  Of course, if there was a movie that had a white hero and black villain, you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find it.</p>
<p>I really detest that new Verizon commercial that they have been showing repeatedly.  The one with all the white guys standing around and the black guy pulls up to announce that they have switched to Verizon and the doopey looking white guy says &#8220;but boss, ours already come with a holster.&#8221;  Anybody else seen that commerical?  </p>
<p>I also noticed that the hotel chain that was showing that disgusting commercial where the two white guys are using straws to blow bubbles in a bathtub while a black guy takes a bath, has not been on TV for quite awhile. I wanted to contact that hotel chain to issue a complaint but then the commercial suddenly disappeared and hasn&rsquo;t been shown again.  I am hoping that the reason it disappeared from the airwaves is because a large number of people saw it and complained.  It was the most disgusting commercial I have seen a long time.  I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>As for a black Bond, who cares.  I got fed up with Hollywood a long time ago.  The last film I saw was &#8220;An American Carol&#8221; and before that &#8220;The Passion of the Christ.&#8221;  So you can see I&rsquo;m not wasting my hard earned dollars on a group of people who I think are totally out of the loop and totally loopie.</p>

			<p>If they want to kill off the franchise then a black Bond is the way to go.</p>
<p>Bond is an Englishman. There can be no such thing as a black Englishman. Englishman are white Northern European people.</p>
<p>Fact.</p>
<p>Having seen every Bond film so far, I would not spend my money on a black Bond. If I wanted something like that I can see Shaft.</p>

			<p>The way that a communist takeover of a nation works is like this: the party leadership (ruling elites) indoctrinates the peasant class to hate, fear and eventually destroy everyone who is better educated and more successful than they are (i.e. the middle class).  Until recently America had no peasant class and the communist leadership has had to make do with blacks from the lower class.  Recently they began importing alien honest to gosh foreign peasants (illegals) to supplement the blacks whom they have filled with envy and hatred of the white middle class.</p>
<p>Hollywood is a major player in emboldening black America by foisting the illusion that black dominance over whites has become systemic to American culture.  It is almost impossible to find a movie where blacks are not represented in numbers totally disproportionate to their demographics.  And blacks are increasingly represented as bosses, commanders, and leaders of whites.  Independent thinking adults know this is pure horse manure, but the young believe these propaganda films represent racial reality.  And now with a token black president about to briefly occupy the White House look for a tidal wave of new movies and TV programming depicting whites taking a back seat to blacks.</p>
<p>However, I have to smile whenever I consider that blacks who believe they now have the upper hand over whites, along with the white traitors who embolden them, are utterly clueless as to the storm brewing beyond the horizon that is headed straight for them&hellip; <br>

			<p>Why stop with just having a Black actor as James Bond?  Why not have the entire cast Black, the entire production crew, the writers, the executive producers, the publicists, etc.?  Now that would be entertaining, but unintentionally so.  </p>
<p>And it would serve one important lesson to all the multi-culturists out there  &mdash;  that without the help of talented, intelligent White people backing them up, they wouldn&rsquo;t have careers, and their film projects would disappear down the memory hole.<br>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the practical, real-world problem with having a Black super-spy, like James Bond?  He would stick out like a sore thumb among all the beautiful, rich people that inhabit the world of espionage and high society.</p>
<p>A Black man in a tuxedo sitting at a roulette table in Monte Carlo?  Every security guard and camera would be on him, even if he has a British accent.  A Black Bond with a beautiful White woman on his arm at a glamorous party?  Everybody would watch his every move.  That is why the police use Black undercover cops to go after drug dealers in Harlem, not diamond thieves on Park Avenue.</p>
<p>In the words of Raymond Chandler, a Black Bond walking into sophisticated society  would be about &#8220;as welcome as a tarantula on a wedding cake.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that movies that become box office successes often have less successful sequels because there is more diversity in them.  If there is a black bond it will be the last in this long running franchise.</p>

<p>Other ways of avoiding vibrancy and enrichment include classical concerts, art galleries, museums, most theaters, restaurants with tablecloths and almost anything to do with water. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I must admit I liked Carl Weathers? as Action Jackson back in the late `70&ldquo;s. My favorite scene was when a crack wino stirs his head from the gutter after hearing a police siren and goes, &ldquo;Say! If that`s for me, don`t answer it!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Awesome, Action Jackson was one of my favorite &#8216;bad&rsquo; movies of all time (right up there with Roadhouse).  </p>
<p>My favorite line was after a fight scene Weathers is victorious and the obligatory white chick (I think it was Sharon Stone) looks at him with amazement and says &#8220;You almost tore his arm off Jackson!&#8221;  and Carl Weathers replies &#8220;He had a spare!&#8221;</p>

			<p>Craig&rsquo;s just gesticulating toward his masters, who demand everyone worship the strange, hostile gods of multiculturalism (gods the masters themselves tend not to worship).  He obviously doesn&rsquo;t make any important decisions regarding the Bond franchise, and those who do no doubt smiled, nodded, then had a good laugh about it in private.  Actor&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t known or hired for being smart (high intelligence is probably inversely correlated with acting talent); obviously people would avoid a black Bond, in droves.</p>

			<p>Given the fact that 4% of England&rsquo;s population is Indian and blacks are 2%, why a black Bond?  Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me, I don&rsquo;t want to see a Bond of any color but if your trying to promote diversity, why didn&rsquo;t they do it with their largest minority?  Do blacks have that much of an inferiority complex?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find a greater British film icon than the character of James Bond. Can we white British (sad that that used to be a tautology) have nothing of our own?</p>
<p>James Bond is explicitly white and British, anything else would perhaps be the wakeup call to white Britons that their country is no longer their own and their culture is dead.</p>
<p>Only when whites are unafraid to stand up for themselves will there be any improvement. As a people who have quite literally built and civilised the modern world from uninhabited woodland to vast computerised networks, great cities and spaceflight, when we work at something, we will achieve it. Best it happens soon, before we lose any more cultural and ethnic foundation for our fight to the traitors and marxists.</p>

			<p>What on earth prompted Daniel Craig to suggest that the world needs a black Bond? Did some black person or group put him up to this? Why would he suggest something that, if successful, would simply put him out of work?</p>
<p>One thing about blacks is that they are always trying to horn in on white culture and white institutions.</p>
<p>That said, I do not approve of calling anyone a &#8220;monkey.&#8221; That sort of name calling simply has the potential of turning away those who might otherwise be receptive to our message.</p>

Posted by Dave</p>
<p><br>
What&rsquo;s with these Hollywood/theater types and their obsession with &#8220;barriers&#8221; and scatology?  For decades now, it&rsquo;s all been about &#8220;breaking down barriers&#8221;. WHY?  Plays and movies are praised as &#8220;daring&#8221; (as if that&rsquo;s the highest of compliments). Once upon a time, long ago, theater used to be be about good entertainment. Now, it has to be daring, challenging, breaking new barriers.  Of course, once a barrier has been broken, there&rsquo;s nothing left to do but break another  one. Where does this lead?</p>
<p>Starting way back in the 5os, it was Lenny Bruce who promoted obscenity in public performances. Then, in the 60s, nudity arrived  on stage with &#8220;Hair&#8221;. Breaking barriers again!  How daring!  Then, when that shock value wore off,  it had to go further. Ie, depicting birth on stage, etc. Is that necessary? There was a female cellist (forget her name) who gave cello concerts in the nude. Was that really necessary? She claimed it was &#8220;art.&#8221; Well, it did sell tickets, doubtless from many men who had never attended a cello concert before.  I remember there was a play in the 60s, called &#8220;The Toilet&#8221;, which took place entirely in a men&rsquo;s room.  Was that necessay? There was another one, set in a sauna.  Then it got so that nearly every movie had to have am obligatory men&rsquo;s room scene. Why all this need for shock value?  We all know that people go to the bathroom and give birth, etc. but do we have to see it on stage/screen? What&rsquo;s wrong with just good action and clever dialogue in a well contrived plot? What would Shakespeare have said about this? Would he have set one of his plays in a toilet?</p>

<p>I hate to break it to you, but Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays are filled from top to bottom with sexual innuendo, double entendres, and some fairly vulgar references.  We miss a lot of them, since they were directed at an Elizabethan audience, but they are there   &mdash;   even in Hamlet (whole books have been devoted to cataloging and explaining them).  The theater-goers were there to be entertained, and a rowdy 16th century crowd was worlds apart from the moralistic Englishmen of the Victorian era.  <br>

			<p>Will Smith is earning a tidy sum portraying characters who were originally white. Wesley Snipes and Halle Berry also play roles where one might expect the character to be white. It all kind of evens out though. White actors get to play black sociopaths in those based on a true story and &#8216;ripped from the headlines&rsquo; crime dramas. </p>

It&rsquo;s of a peace with the times: gays wed, customer support speak mangles English, and an achievement-free biracial socialist &#8220;community organizer&#8221; is fawned over by those who tell us what to think   &mdash;  - hailed as a new FDR or Lincoln.

			<p>Please don&rsquo;t be tricked by any official census stats coming from the U.K.!  Its government doesn&rsquo;t want to frighten the white taxpayers too much because the ethnic cleansing is not yet complete.  When the white Brits are a weak minority, then, maybe, the government will level with them to let them know they are unworthy and they better get used to the new way of doing things! </p>
<p>I have tried to figure out why the U.K. government approved the Third World invasion in the first place.  Could it be that the people who really run the world made a deal to allow the Third World invasion of the U.K. in payment for a debt we don&rsquo;t know about?  Is it to substantially lower wages for the working and middle classes so the rich can get richer?  Or are the Brits trying to prove to the world that they are the &#8220;nicest&#8221;, most unprejudiced people in the world by allowing themselves to be colonized?  Maybe there is a plan to dilute the white gene pool to uplift other races while eliminating those pesky whites.  </p>
<p>Take a visit to London if you want to see what has happened to that formerly sophisticated city.  It doesn&rsquo;t at all look like 4% Indian and 2% black to me.  (America doesn&rsquo;t look like 12% black either.)  </p>

Actually Bruce himself was the hero in &#8220;Hart&rsquo;s War&#8221; and &#8220;Tears of the Sun.&#8221;  A DVD vendor that we bought a lot of our DVD&rsquo;s from, said that Bruce ruined his career with Hart&rsquo;s War.  I beg to disagree.  A white Colonel, giving his life to save the lives of his fellow prisoners, including one black guy, makes him a hero in my eyes.  </p>

The whites everywhere in the world has a Serious Sixties Hangover!How many whites are cokeheads? How many whites are peadophiles-the secret life of even conservative white males?  Then the break up of marriages because of `make love not war` lifestyles and the subsequent lonely -individual- lock key kids. The suicide rates are extremely high amongst young whites. Australia and Ireland clocking in daily ahead of other nations!<br>
It is a miracle that we have ANY young white generation x ers!<br>
the low birth rate is directly linked to low morals and greed in the white race.  We are killing ourselves!</p>
<p>What are we moaning about? <br>
My fear is that the aging Boomers will be very very lonely in their old age.  Their drug dependent offspring will have many ailments themselves to cope with ( sexually transmitted diseases and mental illnesses due to sex addiction and drug - alchohol abuse. We might have to rely on Blacks and people of mixed race to take care of us in old age  Many old age homes and frial care facilities in South Africa rely on the caring hands of Black  and mixed race staff! </p>
<p>We trick ourselves if we think all white (mostly white)societies are `functional`- All over the lazy permanently- partying- youngsters are a shame.  We are in for a suprise! Do they have a caring spirit? Nihilistic malignant narcism is more the characteristic. </p>
<p>A Black Bond and Silly Superheroes are the least of my worries-the white and black generation x ers in political positions are.</p>

<p>But that was all, wasn&rsquo;t it? Good Ole Will didn&rsquo;t insist that his actors actually DID onstage what they subtly or not-so-subtly hinted at. And when these innuendos were removed by more Victorian directors or translators, a great theatre still remained. I doubt that the recent &#8220;edgy and dark&#8221; plays would survive the removal of shock factor scenes and swearwords. Unlike Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Craig&rsquo;s remark was so disappointing exactly because I loved the last Bond movie.</p>
<p>Oh, and something else. No matter what Craig and those in the business who approve of a Black Bond say, they can do nothing to take away the OBVIOUS message written in the action of the opening scene in Madagascar when Bond chases, captures, and kill&rsquo;s &#8220;a nobody&#8221;, as &#8220;M&#8221; quipped.  <br>
The opening chase scene was not just a case of a Black criminal and a White crime-stopper.  It was a wonderful illustration of what many great thinkers of the West used to comment on quite naturally, with no fear, or even thought, that they would ever be questioned, let alone censored.<br>
The difference I am refering to, and those who saw the movie will know what I am talking about, is captured perfectly in Rousseau&rsquo;s comment on the difference between the African and the European.<br>
The African, he said, can climb trees.  But the European - <br>
Builds ladders!<br>
In short, they are physical, we are conceptual AND physical.<br>
No wonder Marxists have to hammer away with their propaganda endlessly to make us feel bad about ourselves.  <br>
The problem is - in spite of our obvious gifts of intellectual depth and physical courage, we are also capable of great emotional naivete and of being psychologically manipulated.<br>
That is - Until we wake up!</p>

			<p>  Why is it necessary to remake all the white male icons of popular culture as black men?  Can&rsquo;t blacks and white liberals come up with their own characters and roles? Why the revisionism? Is this another form of humiliation?</p>

<p>  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>This is absolutely right. Star Wars is the prime example. The first movie was all white and essentially a European fairytale. There were plenty of space creatures but the film basically revolved around white human beings. </p>
<p>The sequel, Empire Strikes Back, managed to stay mostly white with the minor addition of the Billy Dee Williams character near the end. Diversity reared its ugly head in the third film, Return of the Jedi. </p>
<p>All of a sudden the &#8216;good side&rsquo; had fighter pilots from American affirmative action categories and nonhuman space creatures took on a greater role equal to human characters and the &#8216;evil side&rsquo; remained Darth Vader and the all white male Empire.</p>
<p>With nearly twenty years of political correctness between, the newer &#8216;prequel&rsquo; trilogy starting in 1999 were awful. Yoda and Samual Jackson were the jedi elite and every space creature was an American racial minority stand-in.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for a remake of Titanic where Snoop Dogg plays a heroic ship&rsquo;s officer who tries in vain to convince the dumb white captain to slow the ship down because of the danger of icebergs and then relents to one final sexual encounter with one of the white wealthy women passengers who have been chasing him the entire voyage. Don&rsquo;t laugh! This is the prevailing level of intellect in Hollywood. </p>

<p>Every film is aimed at a particular audience. If you like films with complicated plots, sophisticated dialog, mysteries, games, etc, you&rsquo;ll find they&rsquo;re almost all white.  </p>
<p>If you want to see a grown man dress like an obese woman, knock things over, &amp; scream at people&hellip; that&rsquo;ll be a black film.</p>
<p>Hollywood cares about only one color, &amp; it&rsquo;s green.</p>

<p>That is certainly true, EW, the plays do not rely on it.  The whole attraction of innuendo is that is it just that, innuendo.  That Shakespeare was able to weave it in as effectively as he did is a testament to his writing ability.  The goal was presumably to add humor while showing off one&rsquo;s cleverness at wordplay   &mdash;   acting out vulgarity, or stating it in literal terms, would have been unfunny and un-clever.</p>

			<p> Question is who runs hollywood? Answer it to yourself and realize that its the people who know how to get the money keep it and grow it. They portray whites the way they want to because the social engineers in power have done the same thing to whites in real life. They know who is getting the money in real life through affirmative action, h1b, illegal alien displacement of whites, college recriutment, etc., so this is who they play to so they can get more money and power to keep this visious cycle of making whites poor and making draconian laws(you can hang Sarah Palin in effigy but not Barack Obama) so they can imprison whites. They know whites don,t matter anymore because this is what they set out to do and have succeeded in what they set out to do. And yes they used whites in power to help them. Solutions anyone. I stopped going to movies too but they,ve succeeded in thier goal so it really doesn,t matter to them. Thats why they keep doing it. My opinion. </p>

<p>Right, pretty disgusting to have to listen to the black gangsta rap music before, during and after the movie. I always leave before the credits and that trash starts, but can&rsquo;t mute it during the movie (sadly)</p>

			<p>Take a visit to London if you want to see what has happened to that formerly sophisticated city. It doesn&rsquo;t at all look like 4% Indian and 2% black to me. (America doesn&rsquo;t look like 12% black either.) </p>
<p>I agree with this, I believe the black population in America is more like 40% and most concentrated in the bigger electoral state&rsquo;s cities (hence the Obama win) In the U.K. it may even be greater with more Pakis and Indians thrown in.</p>

<p>No, you aren&rsquo;t the only one who has given up going to the movies.  The last movie I saw was an &#8220;American Carol&#8221; just because I wanted to see them make fun of some of the wacko liberals.  The last movie before that was Mel Gibson&rsquo;s &#8220;Passion of the Christ.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t watch sitcoms because they usually have a dumb white guy with a real smart black neighbor or a really smart black boss.  Even commericals are the same thing.  Every Brinks and ADT commercial has a white criminal trying to break into somebody&rsquo;s house.  I can think of dozens of commercials where the white guy is depicted as a stupid moron.  How about that stupid Windex commercial where the sloppy looking white guy is asleep while his wife cleans the slidding glass doors.  He wakes up and runs smack into the glass.  In the tree are two laughling BLACK crows.  Message once again, is white = dumb.  Black = smart.  Even shows that have all white casts, Desperate Housewives and the now off the air &#8220;Friends.&#8221;  All of the characters on Housewives are slutty white females and all the Friends were slutty white males and females.  When they did introduce a black character on Friends as a girlfriend for Ross, she was, of course, some smart, executive type.  How come Wisteria Lane hasn&rsquo;t been desegregated?  And the daytime soap operas have gotten worse everyday.  After watching the ABC soaps for more 30 years, I finally turned them off.  Too many white criminals, white racists and slutty white females.  In addition, there&rsquo;s more mixed race couples and a lot of gay themes.  I just couldn&rsquo;t stomach it anymore.  So what&rsquo;s left on TV?  Absolutely nothing. And now for the next 4 years, we&rsquo;ll be subjected to Comrade Obama and his beautiful family and 2 little girls romping about the White House Rose Garden.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take Leave it To Beaver, Andy Griffith and I Love Lucy reruns anytime.</p>

Go see my post on November 6, 2008 <br>
Calling the Election for Obama, Special to AR News; 89 comments <br>
(it got through on the third rework&hellip;towards the end)<br>
It has his link <a href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ-STX0x0c" rel="nofollow">http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ-STX0x0c</a> (please watch on wide screen, I find the symbolism of this clip so very powerful) to the very inspiring movie 300(it has currently 1.2 million views).<br>
My 17 year old stepson, who I meet when he was 12(he is blond, blue eyed). Who like most kids is obsessed with hip hop and basketball(side note&hellip;.whenever I read a racist comment on youtube&hellip;I often go to the profile of who made it out of curiosity. It is surprising how often I find their videos are hip hop and basketball clips even when they are anti-black comment makers).<br>
But my point is my stepson watched 300 over and over and over again, and he liked &#8216;King Arthur&rsquo;, &#8216;Troy&rsquo; and the &#8216;Lord of Rings&rsquo;<br>
trilogy mainly for the battle scenes. But still I saw some self racial pride came out of him for once. So the urge is there but the power of the peer group is so strong at that age. And if you go to the popular music these days it is so sleazy and Afrocentric, I wonder where the good Rock has gone.<br>
Unfortunately the timing of when we meet did not work and we do not communicate at all. And I found that he has zero attention span, no self discipline, no work ethic, no sense of consequence(kids these days know their rights too well), no respect for his elders (his favorite shows were &#8216;pimp my ride &rsquo; and &#8216;jackass&rsquo;). And the minute I applied the tinest discipline he moved to his dads thus avoiding doing self improvement (because it was hard). <br>
Popular media displaces white males and makes obtaining breeding age white females the no.1 social goal.<br>
And the choices in our neighbourhood for him were to join some ethnically based teenage gang or live online in World of Warcraft<br>
I now have a 1 and 2 year old boy and girl who I am very extremely proud of, and other than spending too much time here I am trying to spend as time as I can with them.</p>
<p>Re the James Bond thing weren&rsquo;t die hard fans up in arms about Daniel Craig being blond?<br>
What will they think if he becomes an Eskimo or something?<br>
Our enemies are the most insidious, they are killing us by the inch. When the PC police rename a &#8216;man hole cover&rsquo; a &#8216;person hole cover&rsquo;, who has the time, energy, inclination or resources to fight that. But that is how they are getting us, by the inch.<br>
And unlike the symbolism of the movie 300 the barbarians are no longer at the gates, they are inside and have lots of European Americans(etc) helping them.</p>

<p>No, you aren&rsquo;t the only one.  That is why I watch period costume dramas (but even they are getting to be stupid and pc), black and white movies, and nature programs.  I love This Old House reruns on PBS too - and I&rsquo;m female, in my late 30&rsquo;s!  I enjoy watching the old black and white movies for another reason: men acted like men, and women acted like women&hellip;with class and they dressed beautifully.  It&rsquo;s hard to believe that people actually were like that, once upon a time.</p>

<p>And another thing, I never liked Daniel Craig and refused to go see these new Bond movies, because I like my men dark haired (and white, of course).  So, I&rsquo;m not all surprised by his comment. I disliked him from the get go.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying that for so very long now. While my major gripe with the original trilogy is the ever-escalating number and prominence of non-human characters, which we cannot possibly have an emotional response to, it became obvious that Lucas was becoming more and more PC as the series continued   &mdash;   to his story&rsquo;s detriment. </p>
<p>The Billy D character was a direct response to complaints that the first one was too WASPy, from what I recall. And he was not a very compelling character in the least. In fact, I remember as a kid being jolted out of the story when, all of a sudden, this black man with straightened hair walked into the frame. He just didn&rsquo;t fit aesthetically with anything else in the movie.</p>
<p>And the less said about the absolutely dreadful, artistically bankrupt Prequel Trilogy, the better.</p>
<p>At least I&rsquo;m not the only one with this analysis of the Star Wars saga.</p>

			<p>I have to disagree with the notion that money is Hollywood&rsquo;s primary motivation. The biggest moneymaker of all time was, and perhaps my still be, Titanic, which is all white except for a three second clip of a Pakistani family. The absurd casting of blacks has ruined many movies for me and now if they appear in trailers I automatically rule it out no matter how good it might otherwise be. I think Hollywood would make more money without diversity. There should be an annual award for the most absurd &#8216;diversity&rsquo; character of the year. For 2008 it would be the rapper who played the FBI agent in the X Files movie.</p>

			<p>Will Smith is earning a tidy sum portraying characters who were originally white. <br>
Posted by Mr. Pibb at 11:34 PM on November 8 </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on the money there, acording to this he is remaking the karate kid now too, with his son being the black Ralph Macchio. <br>
http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=664109<br>
When they remade Omega man, recasting the legendary Charlton Heston as Will Smith (I still haven&rsquo;t seen the remake), I was hoping people would boycott it in protest. They didn&rsquo;t, and like most remakes my stepson was totally unaware of the original.<br>
I tried to show it to him but his tiny attention span could not handle the slow pacing of an older film or the subtly implied horror of the situation, as opposed to the dumbed down &#8216;in your face&rsquo; CGI type SF in modern films. <br>
Other films he liked though for the fight/battle scenes mainly that I thought were racially positive,to add to the small list I posted earlier were &#8216;Saving Private Ryan&rsquo;,&rsquo;Gangs of New York&rsquo; and &#8216;Black Hawk Down&rsquo;(one of my favorites too).  </p>

			<p>The new Bond will be an intelligent and noble black ubermensch (casting is still ongoing for this part) who has sex with numerous attractive white females who almost remove their clothing on setting sight of him. His arch enemy is to be a fearful and pathetic little white man known as &#8220;The Gimp&#8221; (played by a revived Pee-wee Herman). </p>
<p>Blacks must now believe that their end game is in sight. You never know, a few years of Obama and whites might even begin to wake up. I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on it though.</p>
