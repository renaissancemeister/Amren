			<p>I perhaps can&rsquo;t blame Paul Krugman for why he thinks.  After all, both the Democrats and Republicans are moving leftward, it&rsquo;s just that the Democrats are moving leftward even more quickly.  Therefore, from their vantage point, the Republicans are moving to the right.</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t the Republicans supposed to nominate John McCain in order to appeal to media cretins like this?</p>

<p>But seriously, is it not strange that the more the Republicans move to the left, the more the Democrats shriek about the Republicans being right-wing extremists?</p>
<p>The GOP should have learned by now that there&rsquo;s no pleasing the left!</p>

			<p>LOL  didn&rsquo;t Paul Krugman just win the Nobel prize? For being properly sensitive most likely. He&rsquo;s right in what he says, though, I do believe. Whites, are liable to become so &#8216;racist&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll want everyone else to stop discriminating against them. They are so unreasonably hateful. </p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m banking on. I think if Obama and the Democrats win we&rsquo;re going to see huge changes in the Republican Party and all of America. Race Traitors like George Bush and John McCain have decimated the Republican Party by trying to turn it into the &#8220;Big Tent Party&#8221;. For about a decade fake Republicans have tried to court Hispanic and even some Black Voters to no avail, all the while alienating their true base. Bush won both elections by paying lip service to the retards in the Christian Right. These people have hijacked the Republican Party and due to their low intelligence have ruined it. The Republican Party will have to reinvent itself by going back to its real base, White Conservatives who favor limited government, and a return to the ideals of the constitution.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But the G.O.P.&rsquo;s long transformation into the party of the unreasonable right, a haven for racists and reactionaries, seems likely to accelerate as a result of the impending defeat.&#8221;</p>
<p>So lashes out the vile Comrade Krugman, at a party that has for far too long taken the white majority of this country for granted, and treated them with abject contempt. He bemoans (in the full article) that McCain and Palin have gotten &#8220;uglier&#8221; in their campaign tactics and that the &#8220;moderates&#8221; (i.e., the weak minded and soft gutted fools) in the party have ignored this and their impending doom in the coming election, and thus only the hard right will survive in the US House and Senate from their safe &#8220;racist&#8221; districts. For example, he observers that:  </p>
<p>&#8220;A majority of Americans now live in big metropolitan areas, but while visiting a small town in North Carolina, Ms. Palin described it as &#8216;what I call the real America,&rsquo; one of the &#8216;pro-America&rsquo; parts of the nation. The real America, it seems, is small-town, mainly southern and, above all, white.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when he writes this screed that is meant to degrade and marginalize the Republican party and its white base, what I think he is demonstrating is some angst mixed with wishful thinking. What I think dear old Comrade Krugman is really doing, is fretting about the possibility that if the Comrade BO bubble of &#8220;hope and change&#8221; bursts upon white America and we wake up quite abruptly to its ramifications, that there will be a purified Republican party for us to turn to in 2010 and 2012. A party that realizes that it has nothing to gain and everything to lose in a &#8220;multicultural&#8221; utopia with a white minority; a party that has possibly itself awakened to the surrealistic nature of the nightmare planned by Comrade Krugman and his ilk, and is now ready deal with it on racially realistic terms.</p>
<p>I think it is a backlash against his diversity cult that he fears most, because it is quite possibly about to reach its zenith in one Barack Hussein Obama (an utterly incompetent charlatan) and then be exposed for the depraved Marxist and genocidal campaign of anti-white hate that it is. Then while he worries and whines about the growing &#8220;racist&#8221; thunder and lightning on the right, he might just get a nasty shock from it in 2010 through 2012 and beyond?</p>
<p>All I can say to that is, God let it be so!<br>

<p>That is to say my feverish thinking can in fact be a burden these days. If your reading this site you must be burdened as well.</p>

			<p>I swear Paul Krugman is another example of how worthless the noble prize is today. Republicans as reactionaries and racists?! I&rsquo;ve always, my whole life, associated reationaries and racists with the left. I guess it&rsquo;s all relative depending on your defintion of racists and reactionaries. The left certainly is racist towards white Americans. Yes sir, no doubt about that.</p>

			<p>      On that note, I just heard something interes-<br>
ting on Michael Savage. He aired a clip of Obama cal-<br>
ling for a new, domestic military force that would<br>
be just as powerful as the regular army. This is the<br>
first time I&rsquo;ve heard about even though Obama said it<br>
last week. Why has not any media brought up this puz-<br>
zling and truly chilling statement? How can we discuss<br>
things we don&rsquo;t know about? The Elite don&rsquo;t have to cen-<br>
sor the media-they censor themselves. As for those who<br>
don&rsquo;t like Savage or Amren, they are ignored. After all,<br>
as Krugman says, they&rsquo;re just racists anyway.</p>

<p><br>
Well, the G.O.P. transforming into &#8220;a haven for racists and reactionaries&#8221; is about the only possible HOPEFUL outcome of a defeat (which BTW the NYT should NOT be treating as a fait accompli, as it is by no means a done deal at this point). A reinvigorated, racially conscious, and SINCERELY conservative Republican Party could be the sole silver lining of an otherwise horrific eventuality; the only GOOD thing that could conceivably come of an Obama regime. </p>
<p>Seriously, though: they give Nobels to people who write mindlessly partisan and openly anti-white drivel like this? Sigh. I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised&hellip;</p>

			<p>Given how few black condemn people like Jeremiah Wright and Louis Farrakhan, whereas whites are quick to condemn Tom Metzger and Don Black, and given that us reprobates at Amren merely want an end to the racial discrimination against whites, while blacks insist upon continuing discrimination against whites, I&rsquo;d say that blacks are a lot more racist than whites.  So it&rsquo;s the Democrats who are the party of racists.</p>

			<p>The Democrats really have forced the issue in regard to race alignment. The Dems are an umbrella for minorities of all stripes, gays, and carpetbagger white liberals all fighting the struggle&hellip;the struggle against whitey. So in a sense whites are forced to stick together as we are now outnumbered.</p>
<p>However the Republicans will still attract some who don&rsquo;t have a racialist bent- ultra-religious types, and some remnant Rockefeller Repub types.</p>

			<p>Just like the opponents of Bolshevik revolution were called &#8220;reactionaries&#8221;.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that everyone who opposes mass transfer of wealth from whites to blacks, the so-called &#8216;redistribution of wealth&#8221; (&#8220;redistribution of income&#8221; is more indicative of what&rsquo;s really going on here) is a &#8220;reactionary&#8221;, and everyone who is not enthusiastic of institutionalized parasitism of blacks on whites is a &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>And the mere fact that the U.S. has white majority that is still in charge of the country that they built from scratch where people are still rewarded for their ingenuity, productivity, and hard work, is summarily dismissed as &#8220;white supremacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>The above is just another proof that the &#8220;politically correct&#8221; manure about &#8220;diversity&#8221;, &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221;, and similar notions of &#8220;social justice&#8221; are incompatible with the American Republic as we know it from the U.S. Constitution. For no matter how much extra-Constitutional &#8220;rights&#8221; we give away to the &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; groups, it will never be enough as long as we don&rsquo;t relinquish political power toe them completely.</p>
<p>Remember, that one of the main doctrines that Marx came up with was the &#8220;<b>dictatorship of proletariat</b>&#8221; without which, according to Marx, one cannot have socialism. Expect the same with the current anti-white revolution: they will not stop until the <b>dictatorship of underserved minorities</b> is imposed on us.<br>

			<p>The Republican Party could be as Mr. Krugman describes, but it is too far left, which makes it completely ineffective.</p>
<p>The conservatives are all for preserving American culture and what not, but they try to do so while upholding the social marxist, multicultural religion.  You can&rsquo;t talk about American culture without talking about race, so the only thing the Dems have to do is call the Republicans racists, and they fold like a deck of cards, or frantically scramble to prove they&rsquo;re not racist.</p>
<p>In short, the racist position (sometimes called the third position) is different from both the Republican and Democrat position.  Both Dems and Repubs have redeeming qualities that could possibly drive them to the third position.  For example, the Dems tend to (in theory) take a more naturalistic view of the world, which could lead them to believe that genes are extremely important, thus race is important.  The Republicans are mostly for American sovereignty, and when they understand that American sovereignty is really white sovereignty, then they&rsquo;re converted. </p>

			<p>You just do not get more disgusting.  Keep it up Krudman.  </p>
<p>These words will come back and bite them.  Guys like him think they are invincible.  They are not.  In fact, if you look closely, and listen carefully, they are panicking.</p>
<p>Krudman is a part of the Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan (a guy under the delusion Bush and McCain are &#8220;Conservatives&#8221;).<br>
His behavior and language is so threadbare, so transparent, that he would HAVE to eliminate Free Speech to keep from being found out.  </p>
<p>From Bush to Obama we are moving from a Neocon-Liberal-Left agenda (almost indistinguishable anyway - though you would never know from them and their staged ranting, mock outrage, and frothing at the mouth on cue, in an attempt to convince us that they are not all running the show together).<br>
to a Left-Liberal-Neocon agenda. <br>
But make no mistake - they&rsquo;re all the same people.<br>
We will go from invading Iraq to picking a fight with Russia.<br>
That will turn out about the same as a real fight between Obama and Fedor Emelianenko.<br>
The Left-Liberal-Neocon Leviathan is going to get theirs - just you wait. In the meantime - just becasue THEY think they are invincible doesn&rsquo;t mean we do.</p>

			<p>A friend of mine told me yesterday that an Obama street worker came into his real estate office and asked everyone who they were voting for.  When he refused to say the campaign volunteer called him a racist right there.  This corresponds to everything I have seen coming from the left during this election campaign.  I have heard so many NPR programs, CNN comments, etc., that sometimes very round about and cleverly re-enforce the idea that if you refuse to vote for Obama, you have to be a racist.  This comes first from the blind belief that Obama represents an unassailable ownership of righteousness, including the natural right to be president - because he is Black.  If this is not the most extreme exhibition of general racism, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>

Race Traitors like George Bush and John McCain have decimated the Republican Party by trying to turn it into the &ldquo;Big Tent Party&rdquo;. For about a decade fake Republicans have tried to court Hispanic and even some Black Voters to no avail, all the while alienating their true base. Bush won both elections by paying lip service to the retards in the Christian Right. These people have hijacked the Republican Party and due to their low intelligence have ruined it. The Republican Party will have to reinvent itself by going back to its real base, White Conservatives who favor limited government, and a return to the ideals of the constitution.&#8221;<br>

<p>I take great offense at your assertion that the Christian Right are retards.  I am a Christian Mr. Smith and yes, I voted for Mr. Bush both times and yes, he has completely and utterly disappointed many of us who believed a lot of things he said.  So shoot us. We won&rsquo;t be the first and we won&rsquo;t be the last to fall for the rehetoric that politicians spout when they are trying to get elected.  In Mr. Bush&rsquo;s defense, I will say that I believe that he is true believer.  Unfortunately, what he ultimately believes has cost the Republican Party greatly.  He actually made my stomach turn over when after Hurricane Katrina, he stood in front of the statute of Andrew Jackson in New Orleans and declared that the rioting and looting were all part of past oppressions and inequities.  I was dumbfounded and it has been downhill from that point on.  </p>
<p>But and I hate to even say the word retard, if any people are acting like &#8220;retards&#8221;, it is the lemmings that have climbed onboard the Obama train to the White House.  Their hopes and dreams being pinned on a man who they believe is going to &#8220;pay their mortgages for them and fill their cars up with gas.&#8221;  How retarded is that?  </p>
<p>If Mr. Obama wins, I am prepared to accept it because, what else is there to do?  Perhaps over the next 4 years, the Republican Party will regain it&rsquo;s wits and climb out of the whole that George Bush has dug for them.  I said all through his presidency that his spending wasn&rsquo;t going to ingratiate him with the Democrats or any of those who hate his guts.  It would all be seen as not enough.  I was right.  I hoped and prayed that he would just use that veto pen of his just a couple of times and quit all that spending.  I was wrong.</p>
<p>The next 4 years will be very telling.  Very telling in deed but we are not retards.  <br>

<p>Gayle, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with you if I tried. They are most certainly &#8220;RETARDS&#8221;. I am very critical of my religion(Catholic) but these people of the Christian Right take the cake for sheer utter stupidity  &mdash;  -IN MY OPINION. They would have followed Bush and Company into hell, if he asked them to.</p>

			<p>The Republican Party NEEDS to be the party of racists and reactionaries.  In four years time, BHO and the Democrats in Congress will have created enough new &#8220;citizens&#8221; to ensure perpetual control of the national government.  We will have to have state and local governments that serve us, that practice &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; and every sort of subtle discrimination against outlanders.  Governments that are slow to investigate &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; and are attentive to real crime.  We will not be able to hold out forever against the new status quo, but we won&rsquo;t have to.  Our paper economy, driven by the expectation that there will always be someone to pay more than we did for our house, has peaked.  Great efforts will be made to sustain it, or at least to slow its decay, so as not to alarm the masses, but the good times are over.  Every year there will be less oil coming to the market, because we&rsquo;ve used so much of it up.  The tar sands of Canada are not a new lease on life for our oil-driven economy, but a desperate expedient, an attempt to postpone the inevitable.  Within twenty years, maybe ten, environmental pressures will increase, from rising seas that will submerge some costal areas to shortages of clean water.  There won&rsquo;t be enough money or energy to maintain our infrastructure, let alone welfare and make-work jobs for parasites.  We will need to preserve ourselves, our communities, and our culture though the Obama years.  Over half the White voters in this country chose the GOP.  Given McCain&rsquo;s deficiencies, the lack of reasons to vote FOR him, I take that to mean that over half the White voters were voting AGAINST the new Massaya.  That gives us a hundred million people to work with, and they are largely the better sort.  The Republicans did NOT mount get out the vote campaigns among ex-felons, foreigners, and the homeless.  Those are Obama&rsquo;s people, and he is welcome to them.  But in the hard times to come, there will no room for the useless.  As we working Whites have been discarded by the multicultural regime, we will return the favor, and deny them our labor and our goodwill.  They cannot grow their own food, nor fix their own plumbing.  The urban centers will collapse, a hundred Detroits and L.A.s will mutate into being, and we will watch and wait.  Let the Republicans take down their Big Tent, refuse moderation, and act White.  </p>

			<p>To Gayle Sollenberger:</p>
<p>Bush&rsquo;s first mistake was to sign McCain-Feingold into law. At the time, many observers (like George F. Will) thought is was a mistake, and even compared it to the Alien and Sedition Act (1801, I think).</p>
<p>Then, Bush believed Tony Blair&rsquo;s lie about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction, and plunged us into a two-front war, along with the Afghanistan campaign. The latter HAD TO BE FOUGHT, since Afghanistan provided sanctuary to al Qaeda. But, Bush should have finished Afghanistan first, and then verified Blair&rsquo;s claim as to its truth.</p>
<p>Throw in Bush&rsquo;s disregard for the U.S. Constitution, the very document he swore to preserve, protect and defend. We all know what he said about it - no need to repeat it here.</p>
<p>McCain&rsquo;s support of amnesty for illegals sure helped him with the Hispanic vote, didn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>What also upset me is that he thought we should stay in Iraq for 100 years. Darn, we&rsquo;ve been in South Korea for 58 years. That&rsquo;s longer than the old USSR occupied the old Warsaw Pact countries. What was he thinking?</p>
<p>A lot of people thought McCain would just be a continuation of Bush II.  I don&rsquo;t think a true-blood doctrinnaire conservative will ever become president again - not enough votes out there.</p>

			<p>There is no moral obligation to be genocided.  Nor is there one to abandon the great civilization whites have built.  The West is a white civilization made by whites for whites.  Letting it go extinct is no virtue.  We have an obligation to the long term future of intelligent life on this planet and the universe to stop this.  This is a moral duty.</p>

			<p>WHITE NATIONALISM. That is the answer to our best interest. The republican party has to go in that direction if it is to survive. The republican congress and Bush could have welded whites into a majority for decades if they would have took a hard line on illegal immigration and sent the violaters home,they did nothing. This nation if it is to remain a white/European western civilization has to go in that direction. We can learn alot from others,such as how blacks have risen to prominence. The republican party goes after the hard right,forever bringing them into the fold,much the same way the democrats have brought blacks into the fold of thier party. Upfront you put the brightest and most charisamatic leaders to attract people to the movement. The democratic party has for years used dirty tactics to attract whites into thier ranks,even when it is against thier best interest. We run hard right candidates who appeal to hard right voters,and as a dirty tactic,we run candidates who are less hard line in democratic or blue areas,in other words,we run as liberals or &#8220;soft&#8221; republicans,then govern just the opposite. democrats have run socialist/communist for years who appear moderate,but then vote and govern to the left,we can do the same. Now to find the leadership and the planners to put it in place.</p>

			<p>In the end demographics win.</p>
<p>Our system, which places all it&rsquo;s hope on the mighty dollar is starting to fail us.  </p>
<p>Hard times may be the only thing which force the reawakening of our people. I think European Americans should have the same unity, pride, and sense of puropose that other races now enjoy.</p>
