				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Newling, Daily Mail (London), Nov. 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An illegal immigrant who killed a brilliant young writer by driving into her at 60mph cannot be deported because it would breach his human rights. </p>
<p>Ahsan Sabri, 28, was unlicensed and not properly insured when he roared through a red light and ploughed into Oxford University graduate Sophie Warne. </p>
<p>The 30-year-old died instantly from a broken neck. She had published five books, was writing her first novel and was about to announce her engagement. </p>
<p>But the High Court overturned an immigration tribunal decision that Sabri &mdash; who had overstayed his visa &mdash; should be sent home to Pakistan. </p>
<p>The judge ruled that deporting him would breach his right to &lsquo;respect for family life&rsquo; as he had married a British woman in 2003 and had a daughter, born last May, with her. </p>
<p>Lord Justice Sir Martin Moore-Bick said that if he left Britain, Sabri&rsquo;s wife, Laura Gleeson, 25, a graphic designer, from Essex, and their baby would probably follow and that would &lsquo;interfere with their private and family life&rsquo;. </p>
<p>He accepted Sabri&rsquo;s claim that his wife may have trouble finding a job in Pakistan and could suffer &lsquo; broadly based threats and difficulties&rsquo; as a result of being a Christian. </p>
<p>This section of human rights law also prevents Britain from deporting Learco Chindamo, the Italian-born killer of London headmaster Philip Lawrence. </p>
<p>Chindamo has lived in Britain since he was five and claims to have his strongest family ties here, but Sabri moved here when he was 18.</p>
<p>As such, the High Court&rsquo;s decision threatens to set a precedent in which anyone facing deportation simply needs to marry a British person to stay.</p>
<p>Damian Green, Tory spokesman for immigration, said: &lsquo;This is yet another reminder that Gordon Brown&rsquo;s claim to have brought in automatic deportation for criminals was just spin.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Sabri came to Britain on a student visa in 1998. As he held a Pakistani driving licence, he had 12 months&rsquo; grace before needing to take a new test. </p>
<p>But after a year, Sabri simply obtained a provisional licence. In October 2003, he was fined £150 for driving without learner plates. Eight months later, he killed Miss Warne. </p>
<p>She was a gifted student who started studying history at Pembroke College, Oxford, when she was just 16. </p>
<p>She went on to write travel books, including the highly-rated Bradt guide to the west African country of Gabon. </p>
<p>In her spare time, she was a Red Cross volunteer, helping refugees. </p>
<p>In June 2004, Miss Warne was hit by Sabri on a pelican crossing in central London as she made her way home to Brixton, South London, from a party. </p>
<p>In July 2005, he was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving and jailed for three years. </p>
<p>Last year, an Immigration Tribunal ruled that he should be deported but Sabri, funded by legal aid, appealed. </p>
<p>Miss Warne&rsquo;s parents Peter and Louise Warne, both retired company directors, were unaware of his battle to stay in Britain until told by the Daily Mail. They declined to comment. </p>
<p>The Home Office is understood to be deciding whether to continue the fight to deport Sabri, who lives in Grays, Essex, or to admit defeat.<br>

			<p>The irony is that she is probably the sort of bleeding heart that would object to deporting this guy before or after killing someone.</p>

			<p>Ah the Brits.  Lost the empire and then lost themselves. A warning to the USA: we host a class of imperialist adventurers&hellip; when they cease their quest to conquer others because it turns too costly they will turn on their native countrymen. I cannot explain such behavior except as internalized aggression. </p>

			<p>Hah! Didn&rsquo;t the Mexicans KILL the director Bob Clark (and his son) of the beloved American movie,  &#8220;A Christmas Story?&#8221; Was that dude ever deported or is he still here, courtesy of our useless Federal government?</p>

			<p>He wasn&rsquo;t even supposed to be in the country. When this happened he was a willful lawbreaker. They should throw the book at him. But I suppose breaking the law is only relevant for Britain&rsquo;s who are drunk drivers. </p>

<p>So what!!! He should have thought of his family when he drove recklessly and killed someone. In life, there are consequences to your actions and some of those may hurt your family but that is YOUR fault. If I robbed a bank and got caught, I would end up going to jail and be seperated from my son. My family would suffer. Would I be reprieved from jail because of this. The answer is no and my family would suffer because of MY actions. Anyways, his wife should have used better judgement and not married a Pakistani in the first place.</p>

<p>The parents &#8220;declined to comment,&#8221; huh?  That was probably a good idea.  If they had spoken their minds, they might have been jailed for &#8220;hate&#8221; speech.  Britain has no First Amendment.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;In her spare time, she was a Red Cross volunteer, helping refugees.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OK - he just killed a fellow traveler. There&rsquo;s some sort of poetic justice when this happens. I remember seeing a video of Brits who were fighting deportation using &#8220;civil disobedience.&#8221; I pray for the day this sort of thing happens to the family of an open borders congressman or MP. Call that cold-hearted, but since it&rsquo;s happening anyway it might as well happen to them, right?</p>
<p><i>Ahsan Sabri, 28, was unlicensed and not properly insured when he roared through a red light and ploughed into Oxford University graduate Sophie Warne.</i></p>
<p>He was 1) in Britain illegally, 2) driving without a license, 3) without insurance and 4) running a red light.</p>
<p>What this incident points to is the multiple ways in which illegal immigrants are dangerous. No, they&rsquo;re not otherwise good people who just happened to break the law to come here. They&rsquo;re people who consider themselves above every law that mere citizens are required to obey.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re expected to tolerate them, but they&rsquo;re not expected to tolerate us. Our freedom is dead. Dead, dead, dead. Ever heard of unilateral disarmament?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the fact that&rsquo;s easy to overlook, and that I did on first read: this death occurred in 2004 - four freakin&rsquo; years ago! And he can&rsquo;t be deported <i>because he has a baby</i>!!! Did he have this damn baby 4 years ago?</p>
<p>The more I read this story the better it gets. If Tories don&rsquo;t make hay of stories like this in the upcoming elections they deserve to lose (yet again&hellip;)</p>

<p>Posted by Randy Bright at 7:29 PM on November 5 </p>
<p>You are quite right, Randy.  But do you really think that that fact that we have a First Amendment isn&rsquo;t going to prevent certain free speech from being prosecuted as hate speech as the new American regime proceeds with little or no checks and balances?</p>

			<p>Unbelievable.  I was recently on a brief vacation in Italy, and I ran into scores of young Britons there who weren&rsquo;t just vacationing  &mdash;   they&rsquo;d moved there, raising their families in Italy.  They told me that millions more young British families are doing the same thing in Norway, Germany, Austria, even in France and Spain. </p>
<p>I was shocked to hear that, but with incidents like this, I can see why.  The PC suffocation in the USA, Australia and Canada is bad enough  &mdash;   but it&rsquo;s just about intolerable in Britain.  How could anyone live in that country anymore?</p>

<p>Strangely enough, as soon as he was found to be an illegal alien with a criminal record the story totally disappeared.</p>

<p>Exactly, just like the fact that mexicans migrants  in this country illegally kill nearly 5,000 americans a year. People who don&rsquo;t obey immigration laws are likely not to bother obeying other laws either.<br>

<p>That is a really interesting idea, and perhaps it is the answer.  In the individual, we know that depression often is anger turned inward.  Believing anger is evil is a newer Western &#8220;value.&#8221; Since the superficial goal has become self-denial for the benefit of others, in the most extreme interpretation of &#8220;Beatitudinal Christianity,&#8221; self-supression of anger settles into depression and kills creativity.  It later becomes self-sacrifice.  But the idea that an entire nation, an entire people could be doing this en masse is a brilliant insight and most likely - true.</p>

			<p>Are these people REALLY the descendants of those who held Spain, subsequently Napoleon, later Germany (twice) at bay? Or has the ruling party ordained the dumping of a tranquilizing drug into Brits water systems? To &#8220;numb&#8221; down everyone so as not to get upset over crimes by immigrants.</p>

  <br>
  These &lsquo;judges&rsquo; pass out of Marxist brainwashing centres called law schools and universities. They are taught that the so called sanctity of human rights for everybody (except evil Whitey of course) triumphs common sense and national interest. <br>
