<h1><a href="https://www.thelocal.se/15408/20081103/">Higher Birth Rates Among Sweden&rsquo;s Foreign-Born</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Landes, Local (Sweden), Nov. 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Foreign-born women living in Sweden are giving birth to more children on average than women born in Sweden, new statistics show.</p>
<p>A study by Statistics Sweden finds that foreign-born women had a fertility rate of 2.21 children per woman, while Swedish-born women reproduced at a rate of 1.82 children per woman.</p>
<p>Sweden&rsquo;s overall fertility rate in 2007 was 1.88 children per woman, below the rate of 2.1 children per woman required to replace the population.</p>
<p>Since 1980, the percentage of births registered in Sweden to mothers born outside the country has nearly doubled from 12 percent to 22 percent.</p>
<p>Part of the increase is thought to be related to the increase in the number of foreign born women of childbearing age which has risen from 11 percent of women living in Sweden aged 20 to 40-years-old in 1980 to 18 percent in 2007.</p>
<p>According to the report, Sweden&rsquo;s foreign-born population has increased by more than one million people in the last 50 years and numbered about 1.2 million people in 2007 out of Sweden&rsquo;s total population of just under 9.2 million.</p>
<p>Statistics Sweden projects that Sweden&rsquo;s foreign-born population will reach 1.7 million by 2050.</p>
<p>Entitled &lsquo;Childbearing among native and foreign-born&rsquo;, the study divides foreign-born women into six different categories corresponding to their country of origin: other Nordic countries, EU countries other than Nordic countries, European countries except the EU and Nordic countries, and countries outside Europe with high, medium or low level of development based on the United Nation&rsquo;s Human Development Index (HDI).</p>
<p>Women from most of the groupings were found to have a greater likelihood of giving birth to a third or fourth child compared to women born in Sweden.</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s authors attribute the difference in part to the tendency of newly arrived immigrants to have children shortly after their arrival and in part because some groups of immigrant women are more likely to start having children earlier in life, as well as a tendency for women in Sweden to only have two children. </p>
<p>In general, the fertility rates of women born in other Nordic countries, EU countries other than the Nordics, and highly developed countries outside of Europe such as the United States, Chile, and South Korea, mirror the fertility rates of Swedish-born women quite closely since 1990.</p>
<p>Women born in European countries outside the EU, however, have historically had higher fertility rates than women born in Sweden, as have women born in low and medium developed countries outside of Europe.</p>
<p>The group with the highest fertility rate includes women born in countries with low-levels of economic development, although rates vary greatly from country to country.</p>
<p>Women from Somalia, for example, have the highest fertility rate, averaging 3.9 children per woman in 2007. However, women born in Ethiopia have a fertility rate of only 2.2 children per woman.</p>
<p>According to Statistics Sweden, however, childbearing patterns for foreign-born women are demonstrating a convergence with those of women born in Sweden.</p>

			<p> &#8220;a tendency for women in Sweden to only have two children.&#8221;</p>
<p>So how do they arrive at the 1.82 figure? One or the other must be overstated/understated. </p>

			<p>The most important factor dooming the white race can be simply stated: in our times and for the foreseeable future, nonwhite women are having babies, while white women are not.  Eventually the white racial stock will die out, or be lost to miscegenation.</p>

			<p>The &#8216;unthinkable&rsquo; must become the thinkable.  Voluntary or forced repatriation must take place, not for any criticism of individual Somalis, but purely for defensive reasons.</p>
<p>It is an unnatural or sick animal that assists its own genetic displacement from its territory.</p>

			<p>Whites are outbred by just about everybody except maybe Japanese.  Which is why nonwhite immigration ultimately means the end of white nations everywhere.  This is exactly what the liberals and the power elite want, even the ones who are white.  They hate whites.<br>

			<p>History teaches valuable lessons to those who are willing to learn.</p>
<p>https://www.white-history.com/hwr22p.htm</p>
<p>&#8220;The absorption of the ten percent Black population into the Portuguese population also identically mirrors the disappearance of Portugal as a world power. The Portuguese of the Age of Discoveries and those of today are essentially two different peoples. The effects of the absorption of the Black slaves has retarded Portugal&rsquo;s history ever since. Today that country has long been acknowledged as the most backward country in Europe with an illiteracy rate of over 30 per cent.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Maybe the Swedish government should recognize the population problem ensuing and stop subsidizing the immigrant children.</p>
<p>Tonight, I gave my 10 minutes of public comments at the Middlesex County Board of Chosen Freeholders, in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  I provided the Freeholders with a copy of a one page web article from www.naples.com dated around October 30, 2008, wherein the Collier County, Florida, Commissioner stated that illegal aliens cost Collier County $70 million per year.  I then asked the Middlesex County Board of Chosen Freeholders how much money illegal aliens cost Middlesex County.  Nobody answered until one of the Freeholders spoke up: $73/day.  After the hearing he told me that is the cost of incarcerating each immigrant detainee.  He gave me an off-the-cuff round ballpark figure of 300-400 immigrant detainees. People complain about fiscal deficits without inquiry of the cost of illegal aliens and &#8220;Marijuana&#8221; laws.  I also told them about the initiative the people of Mass. voted in on this past Election Day to decriminalize up to an ounce of &#8220;Marijuana&#8221; which makes it a $100 fine instead of a crime. I also told them about the initiative the people of Michigan voted in for medical &#8220;Marijuana&#8221;. The cost of subsidizing illegal aliens and enforcing the &#8220;Marijuana&#8221; laws.</p>

			<p>There is an interesting study about skin color. The author is Australian anthropologist Nina Jablonski. There is a correlation between skin color and sunlight levels. &#8220;People in the tropics have developed dark skin to block out the sun and protect their body&rsquo;s folate reserves. People far from the equator have developed fair skin to drink in the sun and produce adequate amounts of vitamin D during the long winter months.&#8221;<br>
There is also a map that shows how the skin colors of indigenous people across the globe should be based on how much ultraviolet light different areas receive.<br>
This is scientific evidence that prove why dark-skinned people are not biologically appropiate to live in Europe and North America, otherwise they should incorporate vitamin D and folate in their diet if they don&rsquo;t want to have unhealthy future generations.  </p>

			<p>In the industrialized world, higher educated people of the West learned for years through programs like Zero Population Growth to limit the number of children they have.  They also learned that they would have more resources to raise the children they did have better.  All that has gone out the window as the human population worldwide has soared and birth control has become a nasty word for all but well educated Whites, usually of liberal political outlook.</p>
<p>The other big factor started in Europe as governments realized that they would preside over shrinking native populations and that would shrink the financial resources available to the welfare state.  When the average person learned this, selling non-White European immigration was much easier.  The same thing is going on here in North America.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the other thing to consider; Capitallism requires continued growth, a growing population provides it with workers and consumers.  It would be very painful to actually do the healthy thing and seek to reduce human population worldwide.  But it will be done for us because the planet is what biologists term - a closed culture.  Resources as basic as water and oxigen become too toxic at a certain point as waste products and overpopulation makes life impossible.  And humans are spectacular waste producers.</p>
<p>Some Whites have the illusion that a birth race can help us.  All that will do is hasten the fallout of the certain explosion of the population bomb.  Just because pressure is on Whites in dominant White countries is no reason to imagine the answer is to try to compete through birth rates.  I do not pretend to hold the answer but I know that giving non-White European populations a welcome and support in countries formerly White dominated guarantees an eventual capsizing both economically and genetically.  All these governments are doing with their immigration policies is postponing the day a little.</p>

			<p>Swedes are sliding down a slope.</p>
<p>Africans will financially overwhelm the social programs and hospitals.  Taxes will increase.  Native Swedes will lower their birthrate further to pay the bill for supporting the Africans.  Social program outlays will be curtailed.  Africans will respond with violence, and supplement their income with drug sales and salve their misery with drug use.  Insurance and security costs, loss from theft, and murder, will increase.  Incarceration costs will increase.  Social program costs will increase further.  &#8220;Racism&#8221; and resentment against Africans will increase.  Outlays for research and development, infrastructure, etc. will decrease.  Average age of native Swedes will increase.  Africans will enter police and other security roles.  Safety and security will erode.</p>
<p>Eventually, a hard decision will have to be made.</p>
<p>Trust me. I&rsquo;ve seen it.  I&rsquo;ve lived it.  I live it.  I am an American.        </p>

			<p>Hello Whiteplight @ 10:41, November 7:</p>
<p>You wrote that: &gt;&gt;Some Whites have the illusion that a birth race can help us. All that will do is hasten the fallout of the certain explosion of the population bomb.</p>
<p>Its not a matter of population largeness, its a matter of population density!</p>
<p>There is no alternative to a &#8220;birth race&#8221;, as you termed it, because this is what you have, if more than one populations share the same living space. <br>
Breed out or get bred out. Displace or get displaced. Eat or die. These are the cold, eternal truths of this world.</p>
<p>The idea that people of the European kind might start a &#8220;birth race&#8221; is just hilarious. <br>
In most European countries the birthrate hovers somewhere between 1.3 and 1.5 children, including non-European children!</p>
<p>This translates to a little more than 1.0 children per European women! And this means, that every European generation will be halve in number than their parent generation.<br>
So we will have to start a &#8220;birth race&#8221; just to get back to the 2.1 children/woman that are needed to stabilize our population.</p>
<p>And in America it is no different. The reason higher birthrate of &#8220;White American&#8221; women in contrast to European women lies for the most part in the different ethnical definition:</p>
<p>For example the 5 or 6 million Arabs of France would be classified as &#8220;white&#8221; in America, thus adding to the &#8220;white births&#8221;. The 5 million Turks in Germany would be classified as &#8220;white&#8221; in America, further inflating the number of &#8220;white birfs&#8221;. And all the children that are born to millions of Gypsy women in Europe would be classified as &#8220;white&#8221; in America, which would then totally distort the number of &#8220;white births&#8221;!!!</p>
<p>In other words: The European birthrate is just a iota above extinction&hellip;<br>
But many of us will not capitulate (and copulate instead)!</p>
<p>And my well-intentioned advice to my kindred people to the west of the European Ocean (=Atlantic) is to stop identifying themselves as &#8220;white&#8221; and use the word &#8220;European-American&#8221; or just &#8220;American&#8221; instead! <br>
The word &#8220;white&#8221; is worn out and its continued use will only harm the interests of the European Americans.</p>
<p>Best regards<br>

All so true.  But those Third World  populations would not have soared without our generous contributions of food, medicine, technology, advice and financial aid.   </p>
<p>In the absence of these, Mother Nature would have resolved the problem in her own  harsh Malthusian way, as she has always done since the beginning of time when a species overpopulates its territory.</p>

Sadly, they won&rsquo;t trust you. They won&rsquo;t believe you. They will have to live it and experience it themselves.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s sad, but like teenagers who think they know it all, they won&rsquo;t listen to experience. They will have to learn the hard way.</p>
