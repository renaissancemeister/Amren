				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlotte Gill and Caroline Grant, Daily Mail (London), November 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It looked like the kind of hi-tech kit you&rsquo;d find in a James Bond movie &mdash; a shirt with tiny buttonhole cameras sewn in, a microphone and a small earpiece.</p>
<p>Yet this was no spy film but part of sophisticated scam to help Chinese immigrants cheat their &lsquo;Britishness&rsquo; exams and stay in the UK.</p>
<p>Chinese husband and wife team Steven Lee and Rong Yang would give the equipment to fellow countrymen and sit in a car outside transmitting the test answers via radio airwaves.</p>
<p>The scheming couple, who were paid £1,000 for each test pass, were rumbled in March when a member of the public walked past their flash BMW 3 series, saw wires coming out from under the bonnet into the car and called police.</p>
<p>Baffled officers found the wires led to laptops, radio transmitters and other surveillance equipment in the car and suspected that the pair were involved in cash machine fraud.</p>
<p>Lee, 36, and Yang, 28, claimed that they were using the top-of-the-range gear &mdash; worth thousands of pounds &mdash; to watch Chinese TV channels.</p>
<p>It was only when another Chinese man, En Zhuang, arrived at the scene outside Wimbledon library in south west London that the scam was exposed.</p>
<p>He told police that he had been in the middle of taking his immigration &lsquo;knowledge of life&rsquo; test when Lee and Yang told him that officers were searching the car and ordered him to dump the shirt, microphone and earpiece.</p>
<p>Zhuang, who had £1,000 with him, left the kit at a nearby shop before returning to the car.</p>
<p>He explained to police in interview that the pair would help the person taking the exam &mdash; who may be unable to speak, read or write English. This would involve directing them via the earpiece to move their body so the camera could view the exam paper.</p>
<p>This would then be transmitted back to Lee and Yang who would tell the person taking the test which box to tick.</p>
<p>The couple, both British citizens who live in a £600,000 home in Redhill, Surrey, have made a fortune from the racket and detectives suspect they may be involved in other immigration scams.</p>
<p>It is believed to be the first court case of its kind though police think the scam could be rife across the country.</p>
<p>Once it had been established that the pair were cheating the immigration system, the case was passed to the Metropolitan police&rsquo;s Operation Swale &mdash; a dedicated team of officers who work with the Borders and Immigration Agency to tackle immigration crime.</p>
<p>Lee and Yang were sentenced to eight months in prison at Kingston Crown court this week for three counts of facilitating a breach of immigration law.</p>
<p>Zhuang and 52-year-old Ka Hung Pang, who was in the car when police arrived and had taken his immigration test earlier that day, were sentenced to 180 hours community work for deception in seeking leave to remain in the UK.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dominic Washington, who first responded to the call from the public, said: &lsquo;Lee and Yang were clearly involved in a sophisticated operation using some of the best surveillance technology available worth thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we first arrived at the scene it was very confusing as to what exactly was going on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, working with colleagues from across the borough and the Met we believe that we have uncovered an established criminal enterprise that may be in operation in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will now be educating colleagues about this type of crime, and hopefully it&rsquo;s raised profile and extra vigilance from police will deter others from getting involved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It also appears to be highly profitable and we are now using the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize substantial amount of assets from Lee and Yang.&rsquo;<br/>

			<p>&#8220;It looked like the kind of hi-tech kit you&rsquo;d find in a James Bond movie &mdash; a shirt with tiny buttonhole cameras sewn in, a microphone and a small earpiece.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are the kind of thing that asians in America use to cheat on all sorts of exams, from med school entrance to contractor&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
<p>The companies advertize only in asian language newspapers and &#8220;guarantee&#8221; passing with a high score.  They have unbelievable devices.  One company manufactured the #2 pencils used in those mass tests.  The test takers wore glasses with magnifying lenses.  When they put on the glasses they could see the tiny letters and numbers, question 1 answer B.  Of course they had affirmative action employees working where the tests were made up.</p>
<p>One of my nursing school classes was about half asian.  Around the 4th week of school the administration cracked down on the cheating.  They spread us out in 3 separate classrooms.  We sat 4 seats apart, staggered so no one sat behind anyone else.  Each classroom had 5 or 6 clerks and administrators walking up and down the rows.  We were allowed to take nothing into the classroom but 2 pencils.</p>
<p>The thing is, asians do not think cheating is wrong.  They see their primary and only obligation to their family and clan.  It&rsquo;s like the moral justification for cheating, lying not paying taxes etc.</p>
<p>Blacks justify their crime by citing slavery.  Asians justify their cheating and crimes by their obligation to take care of their families by any means possible.</p>

<p>Does anyone honestly belive that Abdul in his turban, or LaThresha in her Caribbean Afro-weave gives a damn, about being &#8216;British&rsquo; or &#8216;American&rsquo;?</p>
<p>I do not know why the United States and Britain continue with the charade of &#8220;citizenship tests&#8221;. They may as well wave the evil wand of amnesty and declare both nations &#8220;international havens of the world&#8221;. Anything less is a pure charade.</p>
<p>The only question is, &#8220;Which nation will descend to the levels of Portugal and South Africa first?&#8221;</p>
<p>Britain and the U.S. are doomed now that the critical mass of undesirables has been breached. Northern Europe and Russia better wake up and take remediative action before it is too late for their respective nations.</p>

			<p>This attitude to cheating is endemic to Chinese and others from the region. I have tutored them for twenty years, and have seen them regularly present other people&rsquo;s work as their own. If they pay for something, they see it as their work. </p>
<p>Their attitude to the truth generally is different to that of Westerners. They don&rsquo;t feel it matters to tell the truth to someone outside their immediate family or group. Their attitude to public service and compassion to strangers is the same. In Australia, nearly all the volunteer work, including giving blood, is done by whites. Though we see orientals everywhere, looking for opportunities.</p>
<p>Their atitude to transparency and truthfulness to strangers is a powerful reason why they should not be accepted as migrants in western countries. British people might sometimes cheat in exams, but they know it&rsquo;s wrong, unless they are diagnosed clinically as sociopaths. Chinese see cheating as normal. It&rsquo;s wrong only if they are caught. Even those studying to be Christian clergy pay others to do their essays. I know this from first hand experience. </p>

			<p>Here is a weblink to examples of the test in question:<br/>
<a href="http://www.hiren.info/life-in-the-uk-test" rel="nofollow">http://www.hiren.info/life-in-the-uk-test</a></p>
<p>I challenge any of you to take the sample examinations (there are 55 different exams) and try to pass.</p>
<p>Some of the questions are appalling, and if such an exam were given in the United States of America, I am very sure the exam would be deemed unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>

			<p>And were&rsquo;re being led to believe that some Oriental groups, the Chinese being one such example, have a higher IQ average than European whites.</p>
<p>Obviously, only if they can manage to get away with cheating at exams even when the set questions are so easy, a nine-year-old could answer most of them, it appears!!!!</p>

			<p>So why exactly do people out there insist that east Asians have superior discipline, intelligence, and morals than whites?</p>
<p>Then again, why does Jared still insist in doing so?</p>

			<p>The test requires some knowledge. There may be some slightly rigorous questions, but others are so obvious that no knowledge is required. A few questions that require some time studying does not entitle cheating. Besides, a genuine applicant can go through many tests an accumulate a knowledge of many answers. In any case, it would be better if these people didn&rsquo;t have any opportunity to settle at all.</p>

			<p>&#8220;So why exactly do people out there insist that east Asians have superior discipline, intelligence, and morals than whites?&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on various stats such as crime, household savings, the general feeling of cooperation from being in a country, etc. we&rsquo;ve figured that East Asians have a sense of togetherness that is unmatched.  </p>

			<p>To the Anonymous poster at 8:09 pm, some of the things you claim need addressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their [Chinese] attitude to public service and compassion to strangers is the same. In Australia, nearly all the volunteer work, including giving blood, is done by whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Australia is fully 85% White. Of course almost everything you see will be done by Whites. How did you arrive at a judgment of another race&rsquo;s compassion from this?</p>
<p>&#8220;British people might sometimes cheat in exams, but they know it&rsquo;s wrong, unless they are diagnosed clinically as sociopaths. Chinese see cheating as normal. It&rsquo;s wrong only if they are caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have basically implied that the Chinese are all sociopaths, which is completely unwarranted. Views of them as being totally amoral are way too extreme.  </p>
<p><br/>
Perhaps someone could enlighten me, on a related albeit off-topic note. I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s for historical reasons (eg. wars against Japan, Korea, Vietnam etc), their intelligence or something else - but where did this distrust come from? People who fear China fear it for its capability to pose a CONVENTIONAL threat. I genuinely believe that East Asians don&rsquo;t harbor any real animosity toward Whites. If China is pissed it&rsquo;s because America supports Taiwan and intentionally divides its motherland. Those guys might also be a bit annoyed since lots of Whites try to pursue their women (so there is probably no sympathy among Asian males for our problem of say blacks mixing with white women in droves). In either case, Whites have been -their- problem. They don&rsquo;t believe we are serious about White segregation, homeland and opposition to race-mixing&hellip;and who can blame them? &hellip;there is nothing in our actions that indicate we believe it either.    </p>

<p>View of a US space shuttle on the launch pad at the Kennedy &hellip;</p>
<p> <br/>
  A Chinese-born physicist Monday pleaded guilty before a US court to illegally exporting American military space know-how to China, US officials said. <br/>
Naturalized US citizen Shu Quan-Sheng, admitted handing over to Beijing information on the design and development of a fueling system for space launch vehicles between 2003 and 2007, the Justice Department said. </p>
<p>Shu, 68, pleaded guilty to violating the Arms Export Control Act by helping Chinese officials based at the space facility on southern Hainan island to develop manned space flight and future missions to the Moon. </p>
<p>He also acknowledged he had sent them in December 2003 a specific military document detailing the design of liquid hydrogen tanks crucial to launching vehicles into space, the Justice Department said in a statement.<br/>
