<h1><a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,24674314-5014239,00.html">Facebook, Myspace, Youtube Are &lsquo;Recruiting Tools for Hate Groups&rsquo;</a></h1>
 

<p>news.com.au (Sydney), November 19, 2008</p>

<p>THE popular websites MySpace, Facebook and YouTube are being used as recruiting tools by extremist groups, experts have warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;(These websites) are the &lsquo;killer apps&rsquo; of the internet today, and they&rsquo;re used by millions, but the virus of hate certainly has infected those technologies,&#8221; Christopher Wolf, chair of the International Network Against CyberHate (INACH), told the Global Summit on Internet Hate Speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;The internet toolbox that is available to hatemongers has had a number of new items added to it over the last several years,&#8221; Mr Wolf said, citing Web 2.0 features such as blogs, social networks, video sites and instant messaging.</p>
<p>Deborah Lauter, national director of civil rights for the Anti-Defamation League, said extremist groups &#8220;use these social-networking sites and they create a community, a community of hate and it has very real consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Lauter cited the case of an Oklahoma woman who was shot dead this month, allegedly by a member of the white supremacist Ku Klan Klan, after being recruited through MySpace.</p>
<p>The woman was killed after she apparently changed her mind and tried to flee a Ku Klux Klan initiation rite, according to police in Louisiana.</p>
<p>Stefan Glaser, co-founder of anti-hate group INACH, said that with Web 2.0 tools &#8220;the effect of hate is getting broadened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neo-Nazis are very well aware of social network platforms for recruiting the next generation, for infiltrating youth groups,&#8221; said Mr Glaser, who runs Jugendschutz.net, the German bureau for protecting minors online.</p>
<p>&#8220;On YouTube, for example, there are thousands of hate videos that are uploaded with messages of racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and intolerance towards minorities,&#8221; said Mr Wolf, a lawyer and expert in internet law.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are sites on Facebook and MySpace that promote civil rights but there are many, many more that demonize Jews and Muslims and Gays and other minorities,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of that is prohibited by the operators of Facebook and MySpace in the terms of service,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we report these sites to the operators of these services they often are removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But for every site that we can report and get taken down there is at least one other site to replace it and often many others,&#8221; Mr Wolf added.</p>
<p>Brian Marcus, an analyst for the US Department of Homeland Security, said &#8220;extremists and terrorists are just like the other users of electronic media.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They adapt to the new ways and the new technologies with incredible speed,&#8221; he said, warning that &#8220;these emerging medium give scale, scope and speed and a new dimension to terrorism and extremism unlike anything seen in the past.&#8221;</p>
