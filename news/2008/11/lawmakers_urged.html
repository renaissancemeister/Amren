<h1>Lawmakers Urged to Stem Wave of Hate Crimes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alison Raphael, Inter Press Service, November 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Leading civil rights groups Monday denounced the rise in hate crimes taking place in the United States, especially against Hispanics, and called for passage of the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crime Prevention Act (LLEHCP) to ensure federal jurisdiction when local officials fail to act.</p>
<p>Hate crimes against Hispanics have risen steadily for the last four years, and crimes against African-American, Asian-American and Jewish people, as well as gays and lesbians, all increased last year, according to FBI statistics gathered for the Uniform Crime Reporting Programme.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The wave of hate that is seeping through our communities threatens the fabric of our nation and is costing lives. Americans will not be cowed by those trying to advance intolerance &mdash; we must stand up to the presence of hate groups and extremists in our communities and speak with one voice to say we will not be dehumanised,&#8221; argued Janet Murguía, director of the National Council of La Raza, the oldest and largest Hispanic American civil rights organisation.</p>
<p>Murghía was joined by representatives of African-American, Asian-American and Jewish groups concerned about the rise in hate crimes, especially in the context of the election of Barack Obama as president and the deteriorating economic situation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At present, local officials have wide latitude in defining what constitutes a hate crime, and depending on the local environment, may ignore many crimes meant to be covered under existing legislation.</p>
<p>The bill passed last year in the House but was dropped during negotiations in the Senate. Civil rights leaders are &#8220;optimistic&#8221; that the LLEHCP Act will be taken on early by the incoming Congress and administration, according to Henderson.</p>
<p>Need for new legislation, the panelists agreed, stems in part from the fact that local officials may be the very figures encouraging hate crimes; for example, speaking out against those perceived as taking jobs or using or abusing services -a major argument in the ongoing debate over immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Media hate-mongers such as Fox News host Bill O&rsquo;Reilly and CNN&rsquo;s Lou Dobbs, and a rise in Internet-based sites promoting hate, also play a key role in spurring individuals to commit racially or ethnically motivated crimes, according to the speakers.</p>

		<p>Not mentioned here are how whites are victims of hate crimes.  In fact, there was a recent credible report that, evening out various factors, whites are a number of times more likely than blacks to be victims of hate crimes.</p>
<p>Also, many hate crimes against either blacks or Chicano Hispanics are likely to have been committed by the other.  If the latter commit a hate crime against the former, official crime stats say it&rsquo;s a &#8220;white&#8221; hate criminal.  The other way around, and the victim is counted as Hispanic.</p>

<p>Is it possible that black racial hatred of whites egged on by the media creatures play a role in this?</p>

		<p>WHO commits the most HATE crimes? Blacks and Hispanics! End of story! Of course they want to blame O&rsquo;Reilly, etc because they want to shut down all opposition to their multi-cult disaster and they most certainly don&rsquo;t want Whites to wake up to what is happening to them until it is too late to stop it. The ADL/SPLC is behind all these &#8220;hate&#8221; crime laws against Whites to begin with. THEY are the real haters and bigots. </p>

		<p>As a victim of an anti-White hate crime who has seen many, many anti-White hate crimes occur in my long lifetime with little or no consequence to the perpetrators, I would like someone with the access to please expose La Raza as the anti-White Mexican Nationalist group that they always have been.  Their words and attitudes have been absorbed for decades and are behind nearly every crime agains a White in the Southwest where a Hispanic was the Perpetrator.  They and MECHA are little more than terrorist groups with a political arm that will make any argument in acheiving the suppression of Whites.</p>

		<p>Of course, just exercising your freedom of speech rights and speaking out against illegal immigration is now a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;. Make no mistake, this is not about &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; this about politics and playing &#8220;victim&#8221; for political gain. Notice the only group of people left out as &#8220;victims&#8221; are whites, unless you&rsquo;re homosexual. That is because these other &#8220;groups&#8221; want it known that heterosexual whites can&rsquo;t be victims of hate crimes, only perpetrators. This is racist in and of its self, but since this racism is directed at whites it&rsquo;s okay.</p>

		<p>Wow!  I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin.  Only those who have absolutely know idea whatsoever of our own country&rsquo;s FBI statistics regarding black on white crime will buy into this.  Unfortunately, that is the vast majority of this country. Why-oh-why are so many white Americans living with their heads in the sand? </p>

		<p>Duh? Can ANYONE provide VERIFIABLE lists and details of these so-called hate crimes against minorities, perpetrated by Whites? I seem to have little trouble finding Black-on-White hate crimes. Cleverly called &#8220;street crimes.&#8221; But am unable to find any FACTUAL hate crimes by Whits in the news stories. Which, given the media feeding frenzy such crimes evoke&hellip; makes it very suspect that none appear to be getting reported. Due to the apparent paucity of such W-on-B or W-on-Hispanic hate crimes, the media is forced to blow even second- or third-hand noose stories out of proportion to elicit even mild interest.</p>
<p>As to the Hispanics claiming to be victimized&hellip; The illegals, simply by being here illegally, commit a far greater crime against the American people.</p>

		<p>Why not Also point out the violence inflicted upon whites? Especially considering the greater number and greater proportion (often vastly greater proportion), of interracial crimes committed against whites?. Unless of course seriously pointing this is itself a hate crime. We must not want to stereo-type and demean any particular group. Especially in an unfair or inaccurate manner. Unless it&rsquo;s white folks. </p>

		<p>I miss not seeing Bill Oreilly here in the middle east. In the military camps mess halls the only thing that is apparently allowed on the BIG SCREEN TVs is a damn basketball game. I come in from the field and change the station to ANYTHING but a Fn basketball game and right away, a number of whites gather to watch and it doesn&rsquo;t really matter WHAT I change to, just NOT a basketball game.</p>

		<p>These hypocrites should be called out for their antics.  Which organization has the legitimacy and the guts to do it?  They want to talk about &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;, but how about crime overall, and who is committing it?  Why aren&rsquo;t white victims of hate part of the discussion?  Where is their voice?  </p>
<p>Someone needs to force the demagogues to admit publicly that it is impossible for whites to be victims of hate; or even better, that they don&rsquo;t care about white victims of hate.  </p>

		<p>  So two different men commit the same crime and then some pompous judge declares one to be a hate crime and the perp is sentenced to 25 years without parole, while the other guy gets five years with the chance of parole . How can that possibly add up to a fair trial and equal protection under the law ? America used to be a nation steeped in common sense, now we are steeped in idiot logic . Very soon now we will begin having political prisoners for the first time in our history, and they will probably look like, think like and possess the same DNA as the Founders .I guess you could say, we have already been conquered .Obviously we are no longer in charge of the nation our ancestors founded .</p>

		<p>Janet Murguia is a vile person. She wants to take away American&rsquo;s freedom of speech so that she and her organization LA RAZA can shape America into their image. This women is a devious, race baiting, punk. She operates by using threats against individual American citizens, like Lou Dobbs and others, who want an end to the lawlessness and chaos created by illegal immigration. While she tries to come off as a reasonable debater on this topic in public,she always uses stupid, transparent little innuendoes that imply Americans who want their immigration laws enforced are racist. These laws Murguia is trying to overthrow, were created by Americans, to serve the interests of Americans, not some Chamber of Commerce, or some religious denomination, and certainly not to serve some racist ethnic interest group like La Raza, that represents foreign nationals who have never been given permission to be in this nation. The sickest thing about LA RAZA, and the arrogant Mrs. Murguia, is that American citizens are forced to finance them, because of  &mdash;  the many traitors we have in this nation.</p>

		<p>Is there a bigger hate crime than running over someone while drunk? Maybe we can drive out all the illegal Hispanics by stationing police cars at the intersections of Hispanic neighborhoods and pulling over any driver crossing against the red lights. Of course, the illegals will claim that this was &#8220;harassment,&#8221; that it applied &#8220;disproportionately&#8221; to Hispanics, and they would be right. But they DID violate the law and the police ARE enforcing the law. </p>

In other words, this is obviously an attack on free speech.  Simply pointing out a few obvious facts is transformed into &#8220;encouraging hate crimes.&#8221;  Thus, a &#8220;major argument&#8221; cannot be spoken.  Guess who wins the &#8220;debate?&#8221;</p>

		<p>A classic &#8220;bait and switch&#8221; by the Usual Suspects.  If hate crimes have increased in the US, the recent news reports strongly suggest that black and Hispanic gang-members, targetting each other, are responsible for the rise.  The suggested solution, though, is to muzzle white &#8220;haters&#8221;.</p>

		<p>A few years ago I was stabbed 8 times. 23 stitches, 13 of those in my hand. The tip of the knife chipped a bone in my wrist. When I asked the detective if the accussed would be prosecuted for a hate crime since he randomly attacked me and said to me &#8220;I&rsquo;ll kill you you white faggot&#8221;. He also chased other people early in the evening yelling the same thing at them. The detective had a very confused look on his face and didn&rsquo;t quit know what to say. So the moral of the story is if your hispanic  you can stab white people because there white, no problem.</p>
<p>The Avenues gang north of downtown L.A. killed at least 3 African Americans because they lived in there neiborhood. Same thing happened in South Central and Long Beach. I believe a 14 year old girl was killed. The L.A. Weekly ran a story and civil and community leaders said no no no these are not hate crimes, you can&rsquo;t say thing like that we don&rsquo;t want to stir up any problems between the 2 oppressed groups.</p>

		<p>Remember this is not about simple media &#8220;bias&#8221;. This about using military PsyWar techniques against Americans to demoralize, confuse and focus real hate against a specific group, that of traditional Americans, mostly white. <br/>
Notice all these groups have come out at the same time. This may be the first of a coordinated attack aimed at softening up the brain dead public to accept full Federal &#8220;hate speech&#8221; laws and the &#8220;fairness doctrine&#8221; type laws. With the &#8220;fairness doctrine&#8221; in place and &#8220;hate speech&#8221; laws, ALL LEGITIMATE CRITICISM against the illegal invasion, cultural Jihad, etc. will be BLOCKED. Traditional religious groups will be shut down, persecuted and reviled for &#8220;hate&#8221; against homosexuals. Those warning of Jihad will be shut down as &#8220;Islamophobes&#8221;. Gun owners will hunted down as &#8220;violent haters&#8221;. It will spread until any conservative, right wing, libertarian views will all be OUTLAWED. The dark reign of the new Socialist Dictatorship will have begun. </p>

He brings up some valid points about a big part of the motivation to censor the interest is comming from the corporate world as well as various governments. <br/>
The internet is the last true voice of truth and it is discrediting the MSM thus print media, and subscription television profits are all on the decline.<br/>
So money, money, money again.<br/>
But he also says that censorship is already happening in the form of Google and YouTube fiddling with search results and veiwing counters.<br/>
On a personal note I have been trolling alot of right wing videos on Youtube in the last week, and it is amazing how quickly you can link yourself from like minded people to other like minded people through their playlists/favorites and looking at the profiles of people who make certain statements and looking at their friends etc. and so on and so on. <br/>
But I must admit some of low viewing numbers of certain videos dampened my spirits, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if the counters were adjusted, because there are so many similar people to us out there, alot. <br/>
Young and old.<br/>
We really need to keep the internet intact in it&rsquo;s current form.</p>

		<p>The leftists omit inconvenient facts like poor whites being at greatest risk as victims of hate crimes.  By only including non-whites and gays in the victim category readers are left to conclude that white people must be the perpetrators.  This alleged increase in attacks is probably around 1-2% or perhaps less, but again this is left out so the reader concludes that blacks and hispanics are being violently attacked by racist, drooling white people after watching &#8220;The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor&#8221; or &#8220;Lou Dobbs Tonight&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let us not forget the left wing battle cry of &#8220;free speech not hate speech&#8221; and &#8220;the first amendment doesn&rsquo;t protect hate&#8221;.  So basically any white person who objects to the daily assaults on his race, heritage and nation is a &#8220;hater&#8221;.  The anti-white diatribes of La Raza, Nation of Islam and anti-white academics will still be considered free speech.</p>
<p>The battle lines are being drawn and will become more visible each month and year.    </p>

		<p>Does it seem that the Reds are accelerating the assault on normal White people?  Many posters here are worried that we are losing the race, but are the Reds worried too?  As Super Dave wrote, the lines are being drawn and becoming more visible each year.  I have long held that most Whites, including liberals, agree with us.  They choose homes and schools by the same criteria as we do, no matter what they might say.  Are the Reds afraid that, when they have to decide, most Whites will pick our side?  Jared Taylor has written about a &#8220;rush to the lifeboats&#8221; when current racial orthodoxy can no longer be defended.  Are the Reds in a desperate hurry to slap us all in cuffs before that happy event?  </p>

		<p>In the meantime the REAL ONGOING EPIDEMIC, black violence (clearly racial in nature) against non-blacks, is ignored.<br/>
 <br/>
This just in: Black male arrested in night home invasion and vicious beating death of white female news anchor as she was sleeping in her bed in Little Rock Arkansas.<br/>
http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,458425,00.html</p>
<p>Most of the daily black on non-black racial carnage goes unnoticed, ignored, and quickly swept under the rug. Like  this:<br/>
http://www.kctv5.com/news/17522030/detail.html<br/>
White female Devin Cassidy, 24, of Leawood, Kan., was shot to death 9/20/08 inside her car at West 42nd Street and Pennsylvania Ave in Kansas City MO by two black males, Brandon R. Smith, 19, and Claude L. Sterling, III, 18.</p>
<p>+++++++++<br/>
As far who is committing 99% of interracial violence against Hispanics (clue, it ain&rsquo;t whites):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zwire.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=19814060&amp;BRD=1671&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=17782&amp;rfi=8" rel="nofollow">http://www.zwire.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=19814060&BRD;=1671&PAG;=461&dept;_id=17782&rfi;=8</a><br/>
1.) Three Latinos, including a 12-year old boy, were killed execution-style by black suspects in South Los Angeles: Police said the victims had no gang ties and no known enemies.<br/>
2.) A 17-year old BLACK youth named Jonathan Banks ran up to a little 3 YEAR OLD Hispanic girl, Kaitlyn Avila, and SHOT HER DEAD, POINT-BLANK, FOR NO DAMN REASON, in front of her home in Los Angelos, as she returned with her dad (also shot) from a McDonalds.<br/>
3.)In June, seven family members, including four children, were shot in their home by a black intruder. The victims, all Hispanic, were killed &ldquo;execution style,&rdquo; police said. It was the city&rsquo;s [Indianapolis] worst mass killing in 25 years.<br/>
4.)In the Tifton Georgia area there were several massacres of Hispanic migrant workers where black gangs were breaking into Hispanic migrant workers&rsquo; trailer houses, raping and slaughtering them with BASEBALL BATS. Similar incidents occurred in other states.<br/>
5.) A black sheriff&rsquo;s deputy in Bakersfield California was caught on videotape repeatedly shooting an Hispanic soldier on leave from Iraq COMPLETELY UNPROVOKED!<br/>
6.) A black bar bouncer kidnapped an Hispanic girl law school graduate in New York City, tortured, raped, and murdered her.<br/>
7.) A black serial rapist-killer called the &ldquo;Baseline&rdquo; killer preyed on Hispanic women in Phoenix Arizona.<br/>
8.) An Hispanic tanker truck driver was attacked for no reason by a mob of black youths in Atlanta: His truck overturned as rocks crashed into his windshield. As he tried to crawl out he was viciously beaten by the black youths.<br/>
9.) As featured on a recent report on MSNBC: A black gang in Memphis specifically targeted Hispanics. In one incident they came up to a Mexican couple in the parking lot of their apartment. The blacks shot dead the Mexican man right in front of his wife, for no reason. This was a stranger on stranger senseless cold blooded murder.<br/>
10.) In Inglewood CA in January 2007, a mob of 15 blacks, while shouting racial slurs, attacked and viciously beat three Hispanic school girls: The three teens were held down by the black boys in the group as three or four girls kicked and punched each of them until they lay bleeding on the ground. The unprovoked attack continued in broad daylight until a passing woman threatened to call police and the assailants scattered.<br/>
11.) In December 2007 in Lake Wales FL, near Orlando: A black male by the name of Leon Davis (30) kidnapped two Hispanic females at random, Juanita Luciano (23) and Ivonne Bustamante (26 and pregnant), locked them in a room, doused them down with a flammable liquid AND BURNED THEM ALIVE!!! This black male, Leon Davis, has been responsible for a LONG STRING of attacks and robberies upon Hispanics in the area. A week earlier he murdered two Asian Indian Hindus in Lake Alfred FL.<br/>
12.) In a January 2008 random racial killing, near LA in Monrovia two black males walked up to two Hispanic girls and opened fire as the girls stood outside one of the girl&rsquo;s apartment. One girl, Salas, was killed. Her friend was injured.</p>

<p>Then the door opens and just who, pray tell, determines whether or not Bill&rsquo;s little tirades are hate crimes? I thought that Barney was white? A little strange but still white.  </p>
<p>This bunch of blacks in the black caucus can barely read, write, and/or think? Even with a Harvard degree the best &#8220;Dollar Bill&#8221; could think of was to hide his stolen money in his freezer? Get real! This is the crowd who now wants to become our censors? </p>
<p>Guess what? If that happens we sure won&rsquo;t be meeting here anymore; or anyplace else for that matter unless it is in a federal prison.  </p>
<p>No matter how much conjuring liberals do they can&rsquo;t seem to turn turn the black race into the white race - its kind of like trying to get a swallow to pick up a coconut [&#8220;well O.K. then a European swallow an African Swallow might be able to do it&#8221;]! </p>

Posted by Amy</p>
<p>Thank you, Amy.  And those WASPS you mention have absolutely NO organizations (such as ADL) to defend them or look out for their interests.  Even the merest attempt to organize such a group would be denounced as an expression of bigotry, and practically a hate crime. They would be made to feel deeply ashamed.</p>
