				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Interview by Robert S. Griffin, American Renaissance, June 2004</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote>
<i> Denis Ruiz is a 50-year-old computer programmer who lives with his wife and daughter near Philadelphia. A short time before I interviewed him, he learned he had non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a form of cancer. He was in significant pain at the start of our conversation, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure he could complete it, but as the interview progressed his voice grew stronger, and his manner became that of a healthy man.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>I grew up in the 1950s in a little town called Fairview Village in south Jersey. It was a planned community designed by a fellow named Litchfield, and offered a pleasant environment for people who worked in the shipyard in nearby Camden. Fairview Village had what you could call garden community architecture. Brick houses were attached to each other in clusters of four, and sometimes two, so the houses were in rows, but the rows were broken up. The houses all had yards, and there were common areas on every block where they didn&rsquo;t build houses. Some blocks had no houses at all; there was just grass and trees. Neighbors would walk their dogs, and kids would play football.</p>
<p>People planted lovely oak trees, so by the time I lived there the trees were mature, maybe sixteen to eighteen inches in diameter. There was a town square with park benches, and people would sit and talk and get to know each other, and there were stores and businesses. It was a socially and economically self-contained unit. Looking back on it, the neighborhood where I grew up seems idyllic, with its parks and shaded streets. In fact, one fellow who had lived in England remarked that Fairview Village was like a little English town.</p>
<p>In the late 1950s, economic changes had a big effect on my hometown. The shipyard folded, as did an iron and forge plant where a lot of people worked. So the town was weakened. But I think it would have rebounded by the end of the 1970s as other businesses reflecting the change away from industrialization came into that area &mdash; like the business I am in, the computer business. But that never happened because a second process was at work: the integration of non-whites.</p>
<p>Before it became illegal, realtors in Fairview Village showed houses only to white families. Although this has been painted as unfair, it reflected the desires of the people who lived there. They wanted to live among their own people. They wanted to live in a white community. Now, I see this as the highest form of self-determination: people defining their own community, deciding what comes into their collective lives, determining their own standards.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if their standards don&rsquo;t seem rational or moral to someone else. People have a right to decide who they will live with. This is not a matter of rationality or of morality. It is simply human. It&rsquo;s not that they have ill will toward anyone; it&rsquo;s just that they know what atmosphere they like. When realtors screened people and showed houses only to whites, it wasn&rsquo;t a dark conspiracy. They were being true to the community, part of the community. But, of course, the issue was never defined this way, and in the late &rsquo;60s&#150;early &rsquo;70s lawsuits forced realtors to sell houses to blacks and anyone else who wanted to move in.</p>
<p>A lot of the blacks who moved in have been &#8220;section eights.&#8221; Section eight is part of a law according to which the government helps pay the rent for poor minorities, so they can afford to move into white areas. &#8220;Section eight&#8221; has turned out to be deadly poison for the Fairview Village of my youth.</p>
<p>The neighborhood where I grew up is now a wasteland. Whites are still a majority &mdash; 55 percent &mdash; but Fairview Village has gone the way of a typical urban black area. When I was living there, when a tree died, an Irish guy named Fred Fagan would plant a new one. Now, those saplings are mighty trees. When a tree dies these days, no one plants a new one. There is broken glass everywhere, and things like busted up shopping carts block the alleys. Many of the old brick houses are covered with some kind of awful siding. When I was a kid, people made repairs and restorations in the mode of the architecture of the town. Now, the houses are all different, from one to the next, and there is no common thread to their appearance. There used to be hedges and white picket fences that lent a common feel to the area &mdash; no more.</p>
<p>My mother still lives there. When I get out of my car I wonder, &#8220;Is this an ambush? Is someone going to jump me?&#8221; Recently, a black teenager knocked my mother to the ground injuring her, and took her purse. This sort of thing was unheard of in the old neighborhood, but it is common now. The black woman across the street was just arrested for robbing 7-Eleven stores.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, kids could go anywhere in town. We could go in the woods and explore down by the creek. Now, you would never allow your child even to walk around the block. Just this year, two black men abducted a young white woman, took her where we used to play ball, and raped, and murdered her. Heinous crimes happen regularly there.</p>
<p>There is no sense of connectedness among the people in my old hometown. A white teenager hanged himself in his bedroom. The word is he spent a lot of time alone, listening to rap music. So much popular music these days is dark and sinister, and for someone already on the edge, as I assume this kid was, that can be deadly. In the old days, the risk of a terrible thing like this was much less. Back then, this boy would have had a supportive white community and way of life.</p>
<p>Back in 1967 or so, I listened to Jim Morrison &mdash; he was the lead singer of the Doors &mdash; and took what he sang very seriously, as if he were Keats or Walt Whitman or somebody like that. I remember one Morrison song &mdash; I think it was &#8220;Alabama.&#8221; The message was, &#8220;I must have whiskey or your wife.&#8221; It was about drunks going from house to house looking for alcohol and sex, and there is Morrison recasting it in a way that glamorized and legitimized scum of the earth. That was what I was taking in. But I lived in a place that counteracted that poison. I had something the boy down the street didn&rsquo;t have. I had a community.</p>
<p>The place I live in now, on the outskirts of Philadelphia, was clean and safe when my wife and I moved here 15 years ago, but the pattern of my childhood home has been repeated. Non-whites have moved in, and the neighborhood has deteriorated drastically. Before, there was a fair number of poor white people, but they were never a problem.</p>
<p>We have problems now, and I increasingly find this isn&rsquo;t a suitable place for my family. It doesn&rsquo;t reflect our heritage and values. The Catholic school here pushes multiracialism and doesn&rsquo;t emphasize academic excellence. My daughter, who went there for a time, told us the black boys were aggressive, and that she didn&rsquo;t like them. That didn&rsquo;t come from us; we hadn&rsquo;t said a word to her about race. We learned first hand, and the hard way, that these liberal, multicultural schools don&rsquo;t work. We realized that we wanted a school of our own flavor. The school that provides the closest thing to a European-type education is unfortunately 35 miles from where we live. So, every day, either my wife or I drive 35 miles there and back. At the same time, because of the expansion of office parks, what used to be a nine-mile drive to my work is now a 25-mile drive.</p>
<p>What this means is that there is no neighborhood here for me at all. A neighborhood is where your friends are, and where your kids go to school, and where you work &mdash; that&rsquo;s what makes a neighborhood. Our people like to be bound to the earth. I need to belong to a certain soil, to a certain locality, and I need to stay in that locality, and for that process to go on for generations. I really believe that my desire to be grounded &mdash; literally &mdash; is a basic white or European impulse. There are cultural factors working against us, like increased consumerism and individualism, and there&rsquo;s the globalization of the economy. But whatever is going on, I have to go to some other part of the region to find work. I feel like a migrant worker.</p>
<p>A lot of whites have been building gigantic houses on three-quarter-acre lots in the far reaches of the suburbs, and this makes them pretty much impervious to encroachment; blacks are not going to go there. But these white people lose in the process, too, because they have to own a $350,000 house, and they are paying out of their ears to keep up with the mortgage. All that money could be used to have a richer life on another level with their children and family. If they lived in an old-style house, they could get by on one salary. They wouldn&rsquo;t have to work two jobs. If they could build a simple three bedroom semi-detached house in a town like the one I grew up in, where the lots are small and there are little gardens and walkways and so on, they could have something affordable, and experience something really worthwhile: living in a tight-knit community of white people.</p>
<p>Because of what has happened to the neighborhood, if my wife and I move we won&rsquo;t get more than we paid for our house fifteen years ago. Without those changes, I would be in much better financial shape. At one time, my mother&rsquo;s house was a desirable property, but it is worth very little now. I don&rsquo;t want to end up like my mother, or in a situation like the one I&rsquo;m in now, where the neighborhood is declining, and I have to either stay and feel trapped or get out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to grow apple trees, and it takes years to do that, and you can&rsquo;t take trees with you when you move. So we are probably going to rent near where I work, and also buy a rural place and go there on the weekends and fix it up. When I retire in fifteen years we&rsquo;ll move there.</p>
<p>What I would really like to do is turn back the clock 50 years. I have been going to homesteading sites on the Internet, and reading homesteading magazines to get guidance and inspiration. I&rsquo;m reading about people who are forming small communities in places like Kentucky, and I correspond with people who are actually doing this, to get a sense of what homesteading entails and what their lives are like. They are all white, and though they don&rsquo;t talk about race, I suspect there is a racial impulse behind what they are doing, at least to some extent. Some homesteaders in rural Pennsylvania have invited me to visit, which I plan to do when I get over my current health problem.</p>
<p>It saddens me to think that I can no longer live where my mother lives and where I grew up. There would be nothing more rewarding than to have a property like that passed down to me in the condition it was once in. Everywhere my family has lived in, we made improvements, such as putting in a nice garden or gutting the walls and putting in new sheet rock, and improving the drainage. Over decades, these changes add up to significant improvements: a better garden, a vineyard, fruit trees, a nice deck. By staying in one place, your property improves and you improve the community, and you form deep, lasting connections with people. That is the way our ancestors in Europe lived. They were tied to a place. I feel that I am all the time planting and that I am never going to get the harvest; that I am never going to live in a true community.</p>
<p>I talked with my daughter about the country place I&rsquo;m thinking about buying or building. I asked her, &#8220;If Mom and I build a place like that, would you like to stay there, live there after we are gone?&#8221; She said yes, she would. She is only seventeen years old, but I think she understands the costs of having to pick up and start over, and she doesn&rsquo;t want to get into that pattern. That house will reflect 20 years of our labor. We will plant gardens and fruit trees and a vineyard, and make improvements. And we will be in a community where we are with people who see the world as we do, and we will know people and they will know us. And then we will give the house to our daughter. I&rsquo;ll bet when my wife and I pass on she won&rsquo;t just sell it and move. She will consider it the place where she should live, and she&rsquo;ll build on it herself. My sickness has come out of nowhere, but once I get over this, I&rsquo;m going to get that house.</p>

			<p>This article reflects exactly what happened to millions of us, to our communities. It is a perfect before and after picture and better gets to the heart of what we are losing as a nation and as a race than any reciting of statistics. Someone should go across the country collecting old pictures and films of our places before the invasion and then go back and film them as they are now, from the same camera angles if possible. Put it on a series of DVDs and distribute them to places that are still white and ask them again why they think diversity would be a good idea for their town. </p>

<p>Or they could give it to organizations like the CofCC and publications like AR who are trying to do something about this sort of tragedy.  </p>
<p>I keep hearing over and over again that blacks don&rsquo;t succeed because they live in bad environments.  Read this story closely   &mdash;   Denis Ruiz&rsquo;s environment was good when it was all white, and became bad when it became majority black.  Same area, same economic opportunity (affirmative action and welfare notwithstanding), but far different results.  Snooty lib can&rsquo;t blame environment in this case.</p>

Not to take anything away from what this poor deceased gentleman had to say   &mdash;   I found his account of urban decay very sad and disturbing   &mdash;   but I&rsquo;m afraid he must have misheard those Doors lyrics. The song in question is called &#8220;Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)&#8221; and was not written by Jim Morrison or any other members of The Doors, but is in fact an English translation of a number from a 1920s German musical by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, the (Communist) songwriting team of &#8220;Threepenny Opera&#8221; and &#8220;Mack the Knife&#8221; fame. </p>
<p>Here, for the record, are the complete English &#8220;Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)&#8221; lyrics. In the original musical, they are sung by sailors in a bar. Although I would never try to argue that they promote good morals, they are not actually about cuckolding other men&rsquo;s wives. As you will see, there is no mention of &#8220;wife&#8221; or &#8220;wives&#8221; at all: </p>
<p><br>
Well, show me the way <br>
To the next whisky bar <br>
Oh, don&rsquo;t ask why <br>
Oh, don&rsquo;t ask why </p>
<p>Show me the way <br>
To the next whisky bar <br>
Oh, don&rsquo;t ask why <br>
Oh, don&rsquo;t ask why </p>
<p>For if we don&rsquo;t find <br>
The next whisky bar <br>
I tell you we must die <br>
I tell you we must die <br>
I tell you, I tell you <br>
I tell you we must die </p>
<p>Oh, moon of Alabama <br>
We now must say goodbye <br>
We&rsquo;ve lost our good old mama <br>
And must have whisky, oh, you know why </p>
<p>Oh, moon of Alabama <br>

			<p>We ran and ran from the blacks.  They followed us to the suburbs.<br>
So we ran and ran to rural areas.  And what happened?  The elites built factory farms and food processing plants in the rural areas and imported illegal hispanic thugs to destroy those areas.</p>
<p>So where can we run?  Nowhere.</p>
<p>It took only 20 years, 1970 to 1990 to destroy California.<br>

			<p>This is a beautiful and sad narrative that millions of Americans, undoubtedly, can relate to.   Whenever I speak to someone who rhapsodizes about the greatness of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and &#8216;multi-culturalism&rsquo;, I ask them a very simple question that always stuns them into silence:</p>
<p>When has any neighborhood ever improved by minorities moving into it?</p>

			<p>In Europe, in White villages, and towns, some people live in 500-yr-old houses, yet these house and the neighborhood still looks nice and are safe.  Compare this to anyplace where Blacks or Hispanics live   &mdash;   in just a few years, the houses (even relatively new houses) are all torn up and the neighborhoods are destroyed.  Blacks are like a plague on civilization and society   &mdash;   not all Blacks, mind you, but a large enough percentage of them to assure that any place they gather will be ruined.  This is why it is the number 1 goal of most Blacks to move away from Black neighborhoods, to white neighborhoods.  Even Blacks are racist against their kind.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Although this (realitor screening) has been painted as unfair, it reflected the desires of the people who lived there. They wanted to live among their own people. They wanted to live in a white community&#8221;.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re going to say common folks have nothing to do with immigration - it&rsquo;s at the beheast of the elites, we should also be fair and blame the &#8216;elites&rsquo; for this realitor practice during the 50&rsquo;s. We shouldn&rsquo;t paint these 50&rsquo;s people as all racists. Just, realists. lol </p>
<p>&#8220;The neighborhood where I grew up is now a wasteland. Whites are still a majority &mdash; 55 percent &mdash; &#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder how many of those are young people? And if the census is accurate. </p>

			<p>An article that has hit most of us, yet Whites on the left and the right will still deny it has anything to do with the &#8220;color&#8221; of ones&rsquo;s skin. It is getting harder and harder to find ANY forum that doesn&rsquo;t want to ban a poster for speaking the truth about race. Listen to any &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk show and you will find that THEY defend minorities in their little ways. They will hang up or ridicule any caller who speaks the truth and says it is ALL about race.</p>
<p> They constantly say that it isn&rsquo;t about Obama&rsquo;s race that is the problem, it is his policies otherwise if it were Thomas Sowell, Condi, etc they would vote for them in a heartbeat! WHAT? They have no concept of race, period.</p>
<p> I listened to Billy Cunningham and Alan Hunt one night and I had to shut off the radio, they got my blood boiling so, when they started saying this very thing! These eggheads would never defend the White race and their heritage, just so they can appear non-racist and pander to the blacks and hispanics in their audiences. Christian radio does the same thing!  </p>

			<p>Familiar story for me.  I grew up in Chicago in the fifties through the late sixties.  My family fled due to the black riots and threat of busing.  Five years later it was a war zone thanks to the Great Society and the curse of diversity.</p>
<p>My family lived in a nice suburb, but that only lasted 20 years.  Now it&rsquo;s a ghetto.  I moved to Seattle and have lived here for 30 years.  Sad to say, it too is becoming a multicultural hell hole.  I have one more ace in the hole and that is some land on an island in Puget Sound.  I think I might be able to live out the rest of my days there while America crumbles.  I have encouraged my kids to consider Australia or Ireland.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The neighborhood where I grew up is now a wasteland. Whites are still a majority &mdash; 55 percent &mdash; &rdquo;</p>
<p>Crime statistics show that when a formerly white neighborhood nears 50% Black, the chances of a White person in that area being a victim of crime is 100%.  He&rsquo;s not being paranoid or prejudiced to worry if he&rsquo;ll be jumped when he visits what used to be his old neighborhood.  He will be.  As Thomas Wolfe said, &#8220;You can never go home again.&#8221;</p>

			<p>In Houston, where my kids and I live and where I make my living (in manufacturing), you find few places where Whites can live in peaceful, pleasant, and secure neighborhoods among other Whites.  This is especially true for working-class folks.<br>
  Right now, we&rsquo;re looking for a home to lease and almost everything available in our price range ($1250/month max.) is in an area dominated by mexicans.  From Mexico mexicans.  You may ask &#8216;so what? What&rsquo;s the problem?&rsquo; and there would be no problem if these people were generally quiet, clean, friendly, law-abiding and courteous&hellip; which they are generally not.  <br>
Trashy yards, cars parked blocking the street, gang graffiti spray-painted on garage doors and fences, sullen, hateful stares, gangs of boys wandering around playing &#8216;chicken&rsquo; with drivers, loud, thumping &#8216;music&rsquo;, taco stands&hellip;<br>
  The Houston my wife and I grew up in, in the &#8216;50&rsquo;s, is dead.  <br>

			<p>Same thing happened to Yonkers NY where my father grew up. Same thing happened to the suburban NJ town where I grew up.</p>
<p>And the same thing is going to happen to the town I now live in which is 99% white. The state of NJ is now forcing every town in the state to take in their &#8216;fair share&rsquo; of low income housing.</p>
<p>This will result in a 20-30% increase in population in our town - which will be mostly blacks and hispanics. Goodbye nice town, time to move again&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;It took only twenty years to destroy California 1970-1990&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely true. Only twenty short years. It is a mindboggling thought, but what the poster said is true and I can attest to it. In fact, it is sometimes still unbelievable even to people like me who lived through it. If this isn&rsquo;t a lesson and a warning to Americans in other states on how illegal immigration and mass unassimilated immigration of all kinds is capable of totally destroying traditional America in a super short time, then nothing will be. Get ready for press 2 for, bankrupt hospitals, and just plain assaults on your common sensibilities.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m new on here so forgive my ignorance.  I understand all of this started in the 1960s when they changed the immigration laws but I don&rsquo;t understand why they did it.  It&rsquo;s illogical and unnatural for a race of people to allow themselves to be replaced by another.  These political leaders pursuing this agenda are guaranteed to be swept from power leaving their children to live in a bleak future.  Having all the money in the world won&rsquo;t make a bit of difference if your a tiny minority with all sides pushing against you.  It just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.  We used to be the greatest nation in the world and now we are a bankrupt country facing a third world future.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d like to grow apple trees, and it takes years to do that, but you can&rsquo;t take trees with you when you move. So we are probably going &hellip;to buy a rural place and go there on weekends and fix it up. When I retire in fifteen years we&rsquo;ll move there</p>
<p>&#8220;Over decades, these changes add up to significant improvements&hellip; By staying in one place, your property improves and you improve the community&hellip; That is the way our ancestors in Europe lived. They were tied to a place. I feel that I am never going to live in a true community, that I am all the time planting and that I am never going to get the harvest.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>(Denis didn&rsquo;t get the house. He died a few months after telling me this.) </i></p>

<p>What a sad story!  It left tears in my eyes.  And it&rsquo;s so true for so many of us.</p>
<p>I was prompted to look up Fairview Village. It&rsquo;s part of Camden, and I came up with some interesting stuff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yorkship Village (known as Fairview today) is historically the nation&rsquo;s first federally-funded planned community.    The concept of a planned community came from Europe in 1918. The architectural theory was to incorporate the ingredients that made the ideal self-contained community&#8221;.  Subsequently, Yorkship Village was the creation of architects that resulted in a new  village, reminiscent of an old English village, that appears to reach back further in history, yet utilizes the innovative planning concepts of that era.&#8221;<br>
<a href="https://www.fairview.ws/maps/maps.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.fairview.ws/maps/maps.html</a></p>
<p><i>Based on statistics reported to the FBI, Camden was the third-most dangerous city in the United States in 2002, and has been ranked the nation&rsquo;s most dangerous city in 2004 and 2005. <br>
 <br>
In 2004, Camden was declared &#8220;America&rsquo;s Most Dangerous City&#8221;, up from third place in 2003 and topping the 354 cities studied. The city was named &#8220;Most Dangerous&#8221; again in 2005 out of 369 cities ranked nationwide, with Detroit, Michigan and St. Louis, Missouri in second and third places. In the 2006 survey, Camden dropped down to the fifth spot  &mdash;  behind St. Louis, Detroit, Flint, Michigan and Compton, California. The fact is that Camden remains one of the most dangerous cities in the country.<br>
 <br>
From 1899 to 1967, Camden was the home of New York Shipbuilding Corp, which at its World War II peak was the largest and most productive shipyard in the world.  In 1962, the first commercial nuclear-powered ship, the NS Savannah, was launched in Camden.<br>
 <br>
The &#8220;Fairview Village&#8221;  section of Camden was a planned European-style garden village built during World War I to house New York Shipbuilding Corp. workers.<br>
  At Camden&rsquo;s peak, 40,000 worked at New York Shipbuilding, and another 10,000 were employed at RCA.  RCA had 23 out of 25 of its factories in Camden. Campbell Soup was a major employer.  However, by 1969, Camden had been losing jobs and residents  due in large part to urban decay and racial tensions. <br>
 <br>
In 1950,  Camden&rsquo;s population numbered 125,000. Now it iis 80,000.The population is presently 53%black,  39% Latino, and 16.8% white.  In 2000, 29% of Camden residents identified themselves as being of Puerto Rican heritage. This was the third highest proportion of Puerto Ricans in a municipality on the US  mainland, behind only Holyoke, Mass. and Hartford, Conn.<br>
 <br>
The population is quite young with 34.6% under the age of 18.   44% of the city&rsquo;s residents live in poverty, the highest poverty rate in the nation. The city had a median household income of $18,007, the lowest of all U.S. communities over 65,000, making it America&rsquo;s poorest city. [as well as the most dangerous]<br>
[Wikipedia]</i><br>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  <br>
In other words: It is America&rsquo;s poorest, youngest, and most dangerous city!  And 5/6 non-white.   </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wager, furthermore, that if you were to break down those classified  by the census as &#8220;white&#8221; (Arabs, Pakistanis, etc.) many would not be what most Amreners would consider white, thus reducing the real white American-born population to an even tinier figure.  This is a microcosm of what has been happening in many American cities today, and what will be happening in other cities tomorrow.</p>

			<p>At the large establishment where I work in NY City, there are many blacks and other so-called &#8220;minorities&#8221; (actually the majority).</p>
<p>Many or most of the whites there have a long commute in from the exurbs. Very few live in the city, and few even live close to it.  One friend of mine drives 60 miles in to work.  That&rsquo;s  120 miles a day round trip! It&rsquo;s nothing unusual.  Others have an even longer commute. I understand there are even people who commute now from Pensylvania to NYC.</p>
<p>Of these co-workers, most of their parents had fled to the  [still white] suburbs way back when the city started darkening in the 50s and 60s.  Now, the children of those urban refugees have moved farther out into the rural exurbs as the colored tide has followed them into the nearer suburbs.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, race being the tabooed subject that it is, you almost never hear anyone make any reference to it.  They claim they&rsquo;re looking for &#8220;better schools&#8221;,  &#8220;open space&#8221;,  &#8220;nice neighborhoods&#8221;, &#8220;low crime&#8221;, etc.  These are all code words, of course. But do they realize it?  I wonder.  Many of these people are (at least superficially) good liberals  who conform to the official colorblind ideology;  and  I often wonder if they even can be honest enough with themselves - even inside their own minds!!! - to admit that race had anything to do with it at all.   Are their minds so numbed by brainwashing that they can&rsquo;t realize, or honestly face,  WHY they keep moving farther and farther out?  Oh, but it has NOTHING to do with race!   Of course not.  How dare you suggest it!</p>
<p>But going beyond that, what&rsquo;s still more ironic and completely illogical is that some of them, trying to be genuinely helpful, even advise their colored co-workers on how to buy a house in the suburbs, where to look, which are &#8220;nice&#8221; neighborhoods, etc. (though maybe not in THEIR area!).  They have bought the leftist notion that blacks just need to get out of the &#8220;bad&#8221; areas in order to improve their lives;  and if they can just go to a &#8220;good&#8221; school [ie. white]  in a &#8220;good&#8221; neighborhood [white], then everything will be fine.   But if that happens, then these schools and neighborhoods won&rsquo;t be white anymore!   </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t these fools  have the sense to think it through and realize that this is going to bring about the very conditions that they and their parents ran away from?  Did they ever THINK about this? Do they DARE to?  They seem to think that Tyrone and his wife are nice people, so Tyrone&rsquo;s family wouldn&rsquo;t be objectionable to have around   &mdash;   but just them.   They limit their thinking to  just one example. Sure, but it doesn&rsquo;t work that way. And there&rsquo;s the flaw.  What about when Tyrone&rsquo;s friends and relatives come around and like what they see,  and then THEIR friends and relatives?  When there are just two or three black families scattered thinly through the community   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re no problem.  But it never ends at that.  In twenty years, the neighborhood will be shot and whites (and blacks too) will be fleeing again. We&rsquo;ve all seen this happen. Do sappy well-meaning whites never learn? They foul their own nest out of their wish to be generous,  but without thinking of the consequences.  In another generation, THEIR children will be fleeing to the outer-outer-exurbs and driving 200 miles a day,  in search of &#8220;nice&#8221; schools and &#8220;better&#8221; neighborhoods!   Are they unable to see that these are just euphemisms for  &#8220;white&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Big changes like this happened all over the country. I know of several towns that were nice places to live, until the government set about to destroy them with welfare housing and forcing lawful neighborhoods to accept lawbreakers.<br>
The changes were intended by government. They wanted to destroy quiet American communities where people trusted each other.<br>

			<p>I grew up in Baltimore City in the late 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s.  Today, growing up in a major city would be dangerous but back then, we had a neighborhood too.  All the kids knew each other.  Some of us went to the Public School #215 and some went to the local Catholic schools.  We all rode our bikes together in the summer, skated, played dodge ball in the school yard, hopscotch and on Halloween night (the only night we were allowed out after the street lights came on), we would go all over the place.  The schools I attended were all white, except for one year, 1963, when they tried to integrate our elementary school.  It was a catastrophe and thankfully, they shipped the blacks back to their own neighborhood schools.  When I reached high school, my school was 98% white.  Today, my former high school has been renamed for a Communist - W.E.B. Du Bois.  Sad because Northern High School at the time I attended there, was ranked as having one of the best high school cirriculums in the city.</p>
<p>Today, my old neighborhood (Highlandtown), now renamed Little Canton, is one of three neighborhoods in Baltimore City that are all white.  Old row homes, with their marble steps, have been renovated and are now selling for over $200,000.  My parents paid $7,800.00 for their Highlandtown house.  Larger Canton and Littly Italy are the only other 2 remaining neighborhoods left to whites in Baltimore City.  Even back during the 1968 riots, the people of Littly Italy, with only baseball bats to defend themselves, threatened to bash the heads in of any black who came into their neighborhood to try and destroy their homes and businesses and Little Italy, Highlandtown and Canton remained the only 3 neighborhoods not ravaged by the rioting and looting.</p>
<p>I think back on my old neighborhood and all the fun we had growing up.  My kids got a taste of that same fun because we moved to Johnson City, Tennessee when they were very young.  Today, 16 years later, I see the same things happening to JC.  We get a swarm of hispanics every picking season and while the blacks still remain in their own neighborhood, there has been a steady increase of black crime and the only high school is having it&rsquo;s share of increased black violence. </p>
<p>I feel really sad that so many kids will NEVER experience the same childhood that we did.   </p>

			<p>To the poster from Seattle who said his kids should consider moving to Ireland or Austrailia, maybe he needs to read up on what is going on there and all of Europe. They now want to bring in 50 million Congolese into the EU on TOP of the millions of Africans and muslims they already have! Ireland is sinking fast and they have the same race traitors that America has, same for Austrailia. The White race all over the world is being systematically genocided. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve had conversations with people about crime &amp; chaos where they simply shrug.  It&rsquo;s normal to them.  They don&rsquo;t dream of quiet suburbs &amp; white picket fences.  They kind of embrace the horror; it somehow energizes them.  This seems totally insane to me, but no less insane than whites voting for a black president.   </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve puzzled over it a lot &amp; the only conclusion I can come to is this: Living in a pleasant, safe neightborhood is, historically speaking, kind of an anomaly. Chaos, misery, strife describe the more normal situation for humans, kind of like a default setting; so that when chaos gradually returns, humans tend to accept it as normal.  Maybe, deep in our bones, happiness bores us.  When I reflect on this it disturbs me, but I&rsquo;m convinced it&rsquo;s true.<br>

<p>&#8220;I will never understand why blacks follow whites knowing they are not wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very simple, sir.  Africans follow Whites because:<br>
1) A neighborhood is already formed.<br>
2) The successful Whites in that area are ripe picking for theft, rape, mayhem.<br>
3) Worse yet, Africans generally believe Whites will NEVER fight back no matter what.</p>
<p>Africans really don&rsquo;t care that they&rsquo;re not wanted.  They realize it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before once-lovely communities will be theirs.</p>
<p>Read post after post one here (and I could add mine about the wonderful civilized neighborhood in which I grew up in Joliet, Illinois in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s) and you&rsquo;ll find many common threads.</p>

			<p>   I am extremely saddened to see my country change, especially as fast as it has lately. I live in a southern Ohio town, a small town of 12,000 people. Just 10 miles away, there is a confirmed enclave of MS-13. There are also Crips, Bloods, and Latin Kings. Out here in &#8220;nowhere&#8221;. Crime is starting to skyrocket. Just where do you go? I may not be a brilliant man, but I see nowhere to run. We must make a stand now. There are no other alternatives. I am really struggling to understand why even whites are so willing to give this country away. Their new masters will not be anymore lenient with them as they will be with us. </p>

			<p>Might Section 8 and its effects on neighborhoods be a good subject for an article?</p>
<p>Additionally, as spreading awareness of race realism, and by extention American Renaissance, is crucial to opposing the immoral presence of low quality people and their spread, and as there are places everywhere where people are having their fiction-based belief in human equality pressed against the grinder of reality, might it be beneficial and within the utility of American Renaissance to identify these places and people, perhaps by subscribers in the region, and to them distribute a special preparation on neighborhood diversification and its effects? <i>&#8220;So, your neighborhood is becoming more diverse&hellip;here&rsquo;s what has happened before, and what people have to say about it.&#8221;</i> It seems to me that many of these people are likely to hold enough of the observations and properly informed behaviors towards race that they would be supportive traffickers of American Renaissance, if only they knew about it.</p>

			<p>Minorities won&rsquo;t accept the fact that Whites simply don&rsquo;t want to live around non-Whites. We keep running to get away from them and they keep following us. The time has come to stop running, turn around and face your enemy.  Get involved in your civic communities, take a stand and speak your peace.  Correct and complain when you see unfairness towards Whites. Network and bolster each other.  Call people out when you see injustice.  Take a stand and get involved in political/social organizations. Hiding and living in the past won&rsquo;t solve any problems and soon enough we will run out of places to hide. And for all those out there who insist on being sane in an insane world, let me ask you where has it gotten you?  Stop dreaming and start taking action. It is our lack of willpower that keep us from turning the tide around. Civilizations fall because no one cares enough to do anything about it. </p>

<p>Imagine how the local ADL/ACLU would howl and scream from the front page of the local news paper, about innocent homeowners being traumatized after receiving racist HAAAAAaaaaaate on their doorsteps.  Law enforcement would be asked to put a stop to it and prosecute the racists.</p>

			<p>     I remember Dayton Ohio in the 40s and 50s.The houses all<br>
   had covered front porches with swings hanging from the <br>
   porch ceiling.Everybody would visit and they all got along.<br>
     That all changed when they started  building houses with<br>
   out front porches.Instead they started building patios to <br>
   the rear of the house surrounded by privacy fences and or<br>
   shrubs.At about the same time television arrived on the<br>
   scene,and we all became isolationists.<br>
     In my mind that was the beginning of the end for our people<br>

			<p>Have you noticed how many of these blessings have come to us by way of the Democrat party?  Who promoted the 1965 immigration act?  Who invented section 8 housing?  Which judges forced busing on the schools?  What about Democrat president Lyndon Baines Johnson&rsquo;s Great Society and the war on poverty?  Is the ACLU affiliated with the Democrat or Republican party?  Who appoints ACLU lawyers to judgeships?  Who has promoted quotas?We are shooting ourselves in the foot when we vote for Democrats.  Even the more &#8220;conservative&#8221; Democrats in congress are following the leadership of the far left that controls the party today.  The Democrat voters have stubbornly continued to vote for this sellout party decades after it had shown its true colors.</p>

			<p><b>&ldquo;I will never understand why blacks follow whites knowing they are not wanted.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>Do you think they worry about what you think?  Do you think they care?</p>
<p>And, too,  as other posts have said here on previous threads,  Africans and other primitive mentalities (Third Worlders)  have what is essentially the view of children. They truly believe that wealth and all nice things just EXIST - like a mountain or a feature of the landscape. They don&rsquo;t ask  where they came from or how they got there.  </p>
<p>They think that greedy whites have grabbed all the nice things for themselves and don&rsquo;t want to share nature&rsquo;s bounty.  (So their pandering politicians impose concepts like Section 8 to MAKE you share.)  It doesn&rsquo;t occur to them that a nice neighborhood (or even country) was MADE by somebody. It&rsquo;s not a fact of nature.  It didn&rsquo;t just drop out of the sky that way.  </p>
<p>But Africans and children don&rsquo;t ask such deep questions. They just see what&rsquo;s in front of them, like a tasty piece of cake, and they want it; they don&rsquo;t ask who baked it.</p>
<p>PS. That&rsquo;s excellent advice from Uncle Cremus! </p>
<p>And for those who claim that whites lack willpower and &#8220;no one cares enough to do anything&#8221;, I must disagree. Many do care. Others who may seem indifferent have simply given up when faced with nowhere to turn. The greater fact is they have had their hands tied, legally, by a long series of government-imposed laws and policies, which have rendered them UNABLE to do anything.  Think of the giant in Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels. We are the helpless giant.</p>

<p>Blacks have been following whites since Sherman&rsquo;s March to the Sea. The simple fact is that they are unable to fend for themselves in any but the most primitive manner. It&rsquo;s unfortunate, but the 90% that are bad ruin it for the 10% that are good.</p>

			<p>It used to be a good idea to buy a house, improve it and build equity.  More and more I&rsquo;m thinking that it&rsquo;s not worth it anymore.  Home ownership is more a liability than an advantage because at any time &#8220;diversity&#8221; could move into your neighborhood and destroy any equity you&rsquo;ve gained while making it dangerous to live there anymore.  Easier to just rent and then pick up and leave when things deteriorate.  Some of you are saying &#8220;take a stand and fight back&#8221; but the only way to fight back (since the government is against white communities) is through underground vigilantism. One person, or even one family, can&rsquo;t do it alone.  There must be broad community support and consequences for those who would break our trust.  There is no &#8220;legal&#8221; way to fight encroaching &#8220;diversity&#8221; because the government is against freedom of association and property rights are a thing of the past.  I suppose, if enough people got together, they could make life miserable for any incoming &#8220;people of color&#8221; but it is the nature of whites to be friendly and trusting so this would be difficult to maintain.</p>

			<p>I have encouraged my kids to consider Australia or Ireland.</p>
<p>To the poster from Seattle who said his kids should consider moving to Ireland or Austrailia, maybe he needs to read up on what is going on there and all of Europe. They now want to bring in 50 million Congolese into the EU on TOP of the millions of Africans and muslims they already have! Ireland is sinking fast and they have the same race traitors that America has, same for Austrailia. </p>
<p>That is certainly true, but the extent between Australia and Europe is different. Here in Australia it isn&rsquo;t bad YET. The neighbourhood I&rsquo;ve been living in for nearly forty years now has just started to get an influx of Africans. No much statistically but certainly rather visible. <br>
Other neighbourhoods around mine have had a bigger influx in recent times and I even personally knew a young fellow that was stabbed nearly to death by five of them one dark night. He was on his own of course. They seem to like knives. I guess that&rsquo;s because you can&rsquo;t buy guns easily here.</p>
<p>I can say to the chap that recommended his kids moving down here that it would be surely better that living in some of these cities in the US that I&rsquo;ve been reading about on this site. I tell you people, I honestly can&rsquo;t imagine what that would be like!<br>

			<p>I have found that people who love blacks the most are the ones who live in all white areas.  Funny how no white liberal move TOO a black neighborhood or next to a public housing project.  I say make it a law to put up public housing on the Upper West/East Sides, Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard and Beverly Hills and you&rsquo;ll see how much these white liberals love public housing.</p>

			<p>My family has lived on the same land since 1914. He is right on about the feeling of belonging and continuing to build generation by generation. My children climb the same trees their grandfather did as a boy. Barns and homes we use and maintain were built by my GG grandfather. He is right on about growing things on the land also. We continue to grow the food and fiber that powers the nation. A peach orchard is next on my list and you can bet I will be thinking of my forefather&rsquo;s as a work the land they did. We have planted almost one hundred trees around the HQ area. </p>
<p>My children would just as soon set themselves on fire than part with the land. They are connected to it deeply. The oldest is 10 so you can see he is mature beyond his years. I hope he will continue to see &#8220;the place&#8221; as his refuge in an uncertain world. It has always been mine.  </p>

<p>The above statement is definitely true.  An example is Papua New Guinea, where the Black natives thought that Whites had magic powers and if they could obtain the magic, then they could get the &#8220;cargo&#8221; (material goods).  The Australians flew them to Australia to show them factories and farms and power plants, but the Blacks still would not believe it   &mdash;   they thought that the whites were trying to trick them.  Many spent their lives sitting all day long in front of their hut, bitter and angry that the Whites would not share their magic.  White privilege, you know.</p>

			<p>This is indeed a horribly sad story which resonates with the vast majority of whites, certainly with the vast majority of white males.  If almost any American white male (I do not include white women here because it is the extreme sentimentality of the majority of them which has consistently made possible the likes of Clinton and now Obama) looks back in one&rsquo;s own life one or two generations he will find exactly the same story in his own past.  This is a very strong indication of the near universality of the reality of the destruction of white community and culture through the ongoing process of forced or government sponsored racial integration of white areas.</p>
<p>I too grew up in the 50&rsquo;s and lived in a place similar to that described by Denis.  It has, of course, changed dramatically since I lived there but other areas associated with my family&rsquo;s past here have also changed even more radically.  </p>
<p>My mother was one of two daughters of a well educated Irishman who settled in Gary, Indiana.  Now any mention of Gary today is associated with one of the worst of the black ghettos in America.  Yet, when my mother was growing up, as the daughter of an administrator in the steel mills who was relatively wealthy where do you think was the most desirable part of Gary in which to live?  That is right, the very center of town was were the most affluent whites like my grandfather chose to live because it was everything which it is not today, i.e. safe, well maintained, all white, and full of the most fashionable stores in town.  No one in my family has ever been back to Gary to see what is left of my mother&rsquo;s childhood home.  No one has the stomach for such a soul-destroying trip into the reality of the reality of the liberal vision of &#8220;change&#8221;.<br>

			<p>We are shooting ourselves in the foot when we vote for Democrats.</p>
<p><br>
This is something I&rsquo;ve tried to get my conservative and white nationalist friends to understand for years now.  This last election was given to Obongo because of two reasons.  The first was to &#8220;punish&#8221; the republican party for not adhering to the conservative agenda.  But the only thing it has taught republicans is that the conservative movement is dead&hellip;.perhaps forever.  The other reason was the hope that, if things got bad enough, whites would &#8220;wake up&#8221; to what has been happening and do something about it.</p>
<p>I got news for people&hellip;.that does NOT happen.  One only has to look at the former soviet union which made every white a slave with a standard of living similar to zimbabwe and PUT TO DEATH hundreds of millions of whites, cruelly.  Guess what.  Communism is still loved there.  If under such extreme conditions, whites don&rsquo;t wake up, what makes people think they will here in the US just because there is high unemployment or neighborhoods turn bad?</p>
<p>We have become a slave race, by degrees and that must be resisted and reversed by degrees.  We cannot give an inch because we might never get it back.  That the anti-racists were able to install Obama into power, when it is so clear that he is an agent of islam and communism&hellip;.it&rsquo;s a disaster.  The sort of disaster that, if we are not careful, can not be fixed without drastic measures&hellip;..revolution followed by ethnic cleansing and a purge of race traitors.  I have to tell you, I don&rsquo;t see that happening&hellip;EVER.  Unless we stop this insanity and push back&hellip;.slowly and inexorably, the white race could become extinct.</p>
<p>We must fight for every inch of ground, by degrees&hellip;.because our race simply will NOT fight all at once.  At that most definitely means not allowing communist psychopathic africans to rule over us.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with you.  I own a house in a &#8220;diverse&#8221; area.  The town has declared itself a &#8220;sanctuary city&#8221; so of course that means that we now have single family houses in my neighborhood that have 3 illegal alien families in them.  (It&rsquo;s now &#8220;racist&#8221; to enforce the housing code.)  Almost every weekend somebody decides to have a loud party that you can hear three blocks away.  I have to keep picking up the trash the illegals throw in my yard.  And MS-13 is now present in my town.  The only one who thinks my house is worth more than I paid for it 16 years ago is the tax assessor.  (They need those fictional valuations to raise the property taxes to pay to educate all those children of illegal aliens.)</p>

<p>Australia is well down the road to embracing diversity. The Lebanese Muslims in Sydney being a popular minority. A friend in Sydney tells me that few Brits move to Sydney now, yet tens of thousands emigrate to Australia as a whole every year. Maybe they find that Sydney vibrancy a little to rich, you can have <i>too much</i> of a good thing after all!</p>
<p>Ireland too is hurtling towards its multi-racial destiny. The streets of Dublin play host to many a black and asian face, even 20 years ago non-whites were almost unknown there.</p>

			<p>The kind of mentality that got us into this mess is the same mentality of people telling us to move our families to another country.  What happens when undesirables come to those new lands?  This is the attitude of a coward.</p>
<p>This is my country and I&rsquo;ll be darned if I will flee for any reason but especially due to  intrusion.  There are plenty of people that think alike and I teach my wife and two children racial consciousness.  They really don&rsquo;t need may lessons as most of us can observe the obvious.</p>

<p>Do you know how american indians are looked upon in Mexico? They are considered at the bottom of society and it has been this way since Mexico&rsquo;s beginning. Mexico is very racist and has a hierarchy based on skin color and ethnicity. The lighter skinned and more Spaniard rule. If the USA is &#8220;taken over&#8221; by Mexico, the american indian will lose out in a major way as the Mexicans look down on them and won&rsquo;t care about giving them any special status as first peoples.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard many good things about Australia however as a warning, nobody even three decades ago could have imagined how bad it would get in Europe or the USA . Western countries, like Australia, that haven&rsquo;t experienced as much 3rd world immigration yet and the problems that come with are more in danger of letting the numbers grow because they can&rsquo;t imagine how bad it can get. <br>

			<p>The bastardization of white miscegination is almost worst than white extinction in that it displays BETRAYAL! That blacks behave as blacks is only a relapse to their original state,.. that whites immitate them is disgusting. That blacks straiten their hair and lighten their skin with hopes of infiltrating the white genegnome is understandable, that whites are seduced is NOT! Will the white race be bastardized beyond value? like a horse w/broken leg not worth saving? is yet to be seen, but that blacks follow whites every where they go is a given. A man without an identity is protoplasm, as the white race loses its racial identity it becomes more and more like a tumble weed, cut off from its roots and blown away!</p>

<p>I live in the South. When the blacks moved up north for jobs they had kids. These kids got involved in gangs. They then would deal drugs, kill, rape and pillage.   The parents shipped the thugs back to grandma who turned them loose on the white kids in the southern public schools.</p>
<p> Now we have metal detectors, police in all the schools which are failing. The answer to failing schools? Higher taxes. Because these parents don&rsquo;t feed the kids more taxes as even in the summer time the schools need to be kept open for feeding progams.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget about the need for midnight basketball to keep them off the streets after 12:00 AM.  </p>

Day by day more eyes are being opened.The Obama Presidency will be the biggest eye opener.Corrupt and incompetent; all will see. Whites will stop believing the lie that Black people are just like us. Once that happens there is no turning back. White people will start saying out loud what they have quietly been thinking for years. We can&rsquo;t living with you people and we won&rsquo;t; and no law can make us.  </p>

<p>I can, and a thing to remember is that if you carry an automatic pistol!  BE SURE TO WIPE CLEAN EACH AND EVERY ROUND AS YOU LOAD IT INTO THE CLIP you may not have time to police the brass in the event you are forced to use it and in most big U.S. cities you, you most likely will be. Use it, shoot to kill, shoot any survivors AGAIN and walk away. When blacks get a taste of their own conduct, they are VERY QUICK to run to the police.</p>

Blacks also seem to believe that all whites have a majic money tree hidden soemwhere in the backyard which grows hundred dollar bills.  They just know that somehow whites always seem to have money, and wherever whites are there are nice things, and they want be around whites so as to get some of these nice things too.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t question why white neighborhoods are nice or who made them that way.  Then, when the neighborhood deteriorates, they claim the city has withdcrawn its services and they blame the white politicians for letting the neighborhood deteriorate once the whites starting moving away. It&rsquo;s all the whites fault.<br>

<p>This is so true. I saw on TV about 2 or 3 years ago, a Mexican woman crossing into the USA illegally. She said to the TV crew that Americans have plenty of money and a good education system and jobs and they had enough left over so they should share. She said she had a right to it. It never occurred to her that these things didn&rsquo;t just happen, somebody had to make them happen. That&rsquo;s why these illegal migrants rights groups who march in the streets demand things. They think that Whites are just selfishly keeping the prosperity that is just laying around all to themselves and don&rsquo;t want to share. Of course the USA is going broke, due to White people&rsquo;s bad decisions and many Americans are not at all well off but that never occurs to these nitwits.</p>

			<p>JustANote,</p>
<p>The tired old drumbeat once again. I imagine you got your version of history from Neil Young:</p>
<p>&#8220;Cortez The Killer&#8221;</p>
<p>He came dancing across the water<br>
With his galleons and guns<br>
Looking for the new world<br>
In that palace in the sun.</p>
<p>On the shore lay Montezuma<br>
With his coca leaves and pearls<br>
In his halls he often wondered<br>
With the secrets of the worlds.</p>
<p>And his subjects<br>
gathered &#8216;round him<br>
Like the leaves around a tree<br>
In their clothes of many colors<br>
For the angry gods to see.</p>
<p>And the women all were beautiful<br>
And the men stood<br>
straight and strong<br>
They offered life in sacrifice<br>
So that others could go on.</p>
<p>Hate was just a legend<br>
And war was never known<br>
The people worked together<br>
And they lifted many stones.</p>
<p>They carried them<br>
to the flatlands<br>
And they died along the way<br>
But they built up<br>
with their bare hands<br>
What we still can&rsquo;t do today.</p>
<p>And I know she&rsquo;s living there<br>
And she loves me to this day<br>
I still can&rsquo;t remember when<br>
Or how I lost my way.</p>
<p>He came dancing across the water<br>
Cortez, Cortez<br>
What a killer.</p>
<p>Wow, those brown people really must be that wise, if Neil said it!<br>

Comrade Poster, there are three faulty assumptions in your unreasoned post.</p>
<p>1)They were not the Original inhabitants.</p>
<p>2)THEY were the Stone Age barbarians, NOT the Europeans.</p>
<p>3)The Indian tribes fought and murdered each other.</p>

			<p>Ive read this guys story in a book before.  Cant remember the name of the book but I got it through Amazon.  Its worth having, just search under the authors title.  My family lived for generations in Oakland but we&rsquo;re all gone now.  My uncle was the last White man and boy did he suffer.  At the moment I live in Australia with my wife and our children.  Its great compared to much of the US right now.  The refugee flood from Africa is down to a trickle, the govt woke up to the fact that the majority of black africans cant/wont assimilate.  And they are very violent and prone to crime and gang culture.  Google &#8216;Adelaide Advertiser&rsquo; and read about the sudanese kid stabbed to death last week at four in the afternoon downtown.  Apparently we now need protection from knives!  Thats how the authorities responded.  I&rsquo;d sooner have protection from africans, dont let the door hit you on your way out.</p>

<p>I hope your homeplace will continue to be a refuge, and not suffer the fate of ranches just this side of our southern border, where the ranchers now feel they have to go armed to be safe from the Mexicans passing through their land. (Most illegals pass &#8220;harmlessly&#8221;, except for trash, pilfering, etc., but with such numbers, there can always be some&hellip;.In any case, the ranchers no longer feel they have untrammeled use of their own property, much less still experience their property as a refuge).</p>

			<p>&#8220;I am sure the Original Inhabitants of this country felt the same way when they were pushed off their land by murdering bands of European barbarians. How does it feel? Not so good. But, remember, what goes around comes around.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most of the land was traded for beads and trade artifacts.  The majority of Amerind tribles welcomed the Europeans and melded into them.  That&rsquo;s why so many Whites have one or more ancestors who are Amerind.  But it is a different story altogether that stone age people ought to be left to roam an entire continent exclusively while advanced technological societies abound everywhere else.</p>
<p>Regardless, you ought to ask yourself this;  Do you think that these people squeezing out White Americans, the ones who have history on this continent with Amerinds will do you good?  Do you think that the new immigrants will care one bit about your old treaties and reservation systems and all your reservation privileges?  You ought to cherish your White people before you loose them because you will loose all the things you gained through negotiations with them.<br>

<p>European barbarians indeed!!  It wasn&rsquo;t them who were the cannibals.  Mohawk Indians were cannibals when the French arrived in Quebec.  My French Quebecois abhored them for this reason.  Other tribes also hated them for the same reason.</p>
<p>Amerinds are descended from Mongolians.  Mongols brought an astronomic amount of death and destruction to Europe.  Directly, through their bloody invasions and pathologically through the diseases they brought.  But ironically, Europeans who surivied the pathological purges brought smallpox to Mongol descendants in North America and assisted the European expansion.  What goes around comes around indeed.</p>
<p>Also, Bobby is right - We have well known history of Indians victimizing one another before and after the arrival of the White man.  I even live near a town in Washington called Battleground.  I first thought this might be where Whites attacked Indians.  No, it is where Indians fought one another from time unknown.</p>

<p>I just love the way that archeologists are finding undeniable proof of the cruelty of the Aztecs and Myans.  It turns out that the original history is true; Cortez was assisted by many non-Aztec tribes who hated them for their oppression - same with those &#8220;sacred&#8221; sites in the Andes where natives were ruled by fear and human sacrifices.</p>

<p>True. The notion of  greedy Europeans robbing the poor, gullible natives has become a  leftist legend.  Just a drop of common sense and a moment of thought would tell any intelligent person that it was simply easier just to buy the land than to fight over it.</p>
<p>And those beads and trinkets that we always hear about,  have to be seen through the eyes of a stone-age person of the time, not in 21st Century terms.  To such a person, an iron pot or axe was a marvel of technology, something he had never seen before, something he had no way of making for himself.   All he had was stone and wood.  Same thing for glass, such as beads or mirrors.  In his eyes these were absolute marvels,  miraculous substances,  and only available from the white men who brought them. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Indian was surrounded by vast, virtually unlimited,  expanses of forest or open prarie. He could easily sell some of this unused land in return for these technological wonders that he craved. It all depends on what you value most.  He had lots of land, but no metal or glass or textiles.  They may seem like junk to us  today, but they had great value to him   &mdash;   <i><b> in that time and place.</b></i></p>
<p>Obviously he was willing, even eager, to buy them. Nobody forced him to.</p>

			<p>The Noble Savage, I&rsquo;m sure had his virtue as did his way of life but as we can see after the wanna be Indian wears off, these people were not in all ways, Noble . As has been pointed out these AmerIndians are likely descendents of the feared, brutal Mongolians that killed and raped so many Indiginous white peaple of Europe in the past. Even their close relatives the Chinese found a massive wall helpful in sharing the continent with Mongolians.</p>

			<p>I almost think the country is totally lost now.  I&rsquo;m waiting for the final nail in the coffin which will be the illegal amnesty that they will surely pass during Obama&rsquo;s presidency. Even if we manage to stave it off again, their anchor babies will grow up to be voting US citizens.  I guess I&rsquo;m getting to where I don&rsquo;t care anymore.  Our culture is pretty much gone as is the quality of life Americans used to enjoy.  You fools that voted for Obama have done much damage to Americas standing in the world and the world is laughing at us behind our backs.  I&rsquo;m wondering if the country even deserves to be saved when there are so many self-loathing idiots in the population.  As for my wife and I, we&rsquo;re moving to Argentina in the next few years.  We&rsquo;re taking Spanish lessons and saving enough money to buy to a house in Mendoza.  It won&rsquo;t be safe to grow old here and we tire of the multicultural garbage that permeates this society.   </p>

To the contrary!  The Romans certainly did.  They were utterly ruthless conquerors and were unimpaired by any Christian scruples.  That&rsquo;s why they were such effective colonizers and their culture and language remain imprinted  on those lands 2,000 years later. That would not have happened if they had been soft-hearted.</p>
<p>They shuffled around entire populations to discourage revolts, regularly took the children of local rulers hostage and held them in Rome to ensure &#8220;good behavior&#8221;, and otherwise did whatever was deemed  necessary to get results.   They marched the leaders of defeated peoples through the streets of Rome and then into the lions of the Coliseum.  The Roman invasion of Britain was, for the Britons,  a nightmare of  foreign conquest and enslavement.  The same bitter story for Gaul - read the story of Vercingetorix.  And the conquest of Iberia took 200 years to suppress all resistance.  Whole cities in Spain were put to death or marched into slavery. The roads of Galicia (NW Spain)  where resistance was particularly strong, were lined with crucified Spaniards.  And just read the story of Spartacus and his slave revolt!  They were crucified too - along the roads of Southern Italy.  (No more slave revolts!)</p>
<p>Of course, after conquest, Rome provided peace, prosperity, and rule of law  to her new subjects (also slavery to many)   &mdash;   but only on HER terms.  It was Rome&rsquo;s way or nothing.  The language, culture, law,  were Roman.   No multicultural stuff. No sensitivity sessions for the Roman legions and governors. This, again, is why Rome was so effective and left such a permanent imprint.  In the end, only after Rome grew soft, did the empire crumble.</p>
<p>Perhaps the main difference between the Romans and the Mongols was that the Mongols came, wrought havoc,  and went. The Romans conquered,  settled down and stayed. (Veni, vidi, vici.)  But yes, I&rsquo;ll agree that in terms of cruelty, the Mongols were  worse. Much worse.  They were often purely destructive and bloodthirsty without reason.  (Mesopotamia took centuries to recover from their depredations.)  The Romans, however,  were a highly practical people; they did not engage in cruelty or destruction  simply for their own sake. Whatever they did had a reason. They were builders. They Mongols were destroyers.</p>

			<p>from Richard, 3:28 AM,,,&#8221;but I don&rsquo;t understand why they did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8216;leaders&rsquo;, &#8216;public servants&rsquo; and &#8216;spiritual leaders&rsquo; did it because they were narcissists.  Narcissists often tell themselves that they are fighting for noble causes; but really, they are incapable of caring for anyone but themselves.  They don&rsquo;t even really care about their own descendants.  All that matters to a narcissist is maintenance of a certain self-image.</p>
<p>As long as that sacred self-image is not in danger, the narcie could care less about his real effect on the common good or the well-being of others.</p>
<p>A good example would be Arthur Miller, who wrote DEATH OF A SALESMAN (painted America&rsquo;s gentiles as feckless losers, BTW).  Vanity Fair did a piece about his retarded son, whom the playwright sent off to an institution shortly after birth, and never visited/acknowledged.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could such a social crusader do something so insensitive?&#8221; was the collective cry.  Well, Miller only wanted the glory that came from the &#8216;crusading&rsquo;.  He only did it in order to bask in the praise.  The kid did nothing to polish his self-image, and so Miller ignored him.</p>
<p>All too many narcissists become politicians, bureaucrats and clergy.  The aura of &#8216;serving others&rsquo; serves their egos.  And if they can hurt the competition (all other humans) while &#8216;being noble&rsquo;, so much the better.</p>
