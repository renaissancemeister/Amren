				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>V Gangadharan, Express Buzz (Chennai, India), November 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Will there be any &lsquo;protectionist&rsquo; measure like a cut in the quota of H1B visas in the near future because of the economic meltdown and &lsquo;electoral change&rsquo; in America? &lsquo;Not likely,&rsquo; was the reply of US Consul General in Chennai [formerly Madras], Andrew T Simkin.</p>
<p>Speaking to this website&rsquo;s newspaper, after participating in a meet on the Indo-US relations in the post US Election Scenario, organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) here on Wednesday, the US diplomat said there had always been a clamour for more number of H1B visas from many quarters.</p>
<p>When asked if the recent developments in the US could warrant any &lsquo;radical shift&rsquo; in visa norms, especially for more popular visa-type like the H1B, the Consul General said such a thing was remote and unlikely. &lsquo;It is a serious thing requiring legal amendments and I do not think this could be a priority,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one thing that we accord top priority at the consulate here is that only the right person goes to the US on our visas,&#8221; he said adding that there had been a marked improvement in cutting down the waiting period to get appointment for visa interviews for persons seeking to go to the US.</p>
<p>Addressing the meet on Indo-US relationship, Chairman, FICCI, Tamil Nadu council, M Rafeeque Ahmed said reversing the economic meltdown should naturally be the top priority for the US president- elect Barack Obama as it would have a direct impact on resurrecting the global economy besides helping India.</p>
<p>Advisor to president of FICCI, and former IAS official, P Murari said the country would have to wait and see for the reaction of Obama to several world issues like Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel and Palestinian.</p>
<p>Far from loss of jobs in the US because of outsourcing, the country had actually gained tremendously due to Indian investments there. &lsquo;This was brought out well by the study conducted recently by the Indo-US Joint Business Council recently.</p>
<p>The Indian investments there helped creation of jobs manifold. Not only American Indians, but all others including the Whites benefitted,&#8221; Murari said.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Far from loss of jobs in the US because of outsourcing, the country had actually gained tremendously due to Indian investments there. &lsquo;This was brought out well by the study conducted recently by the Indo-US Joint Business Council recently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course the &#8220;Indo-US&#8221; Business Council will say this. The reality is quite different. I know so many tech workers who can&rsquo;t find work. H1-B Indians do replace many Americans. In this time of economic crisis, all jobs should go to Americans and the H1-B visa program needs to be done away with. Only if there are work shortages should foreigners be brought in temporarily and there are no work shortages in the tech field.</p>

			<p>H1B visas I hope will brack the backs of the corporate crooks, and the ensuing economic plummet will deplete their bank accounts.</p>
<p>The corporate elites have become an even greater enemy than the political demagogues to the citizens.</p>

			<p>In other words, a native born US citizen has no more right to an american job than an Indian who has never set foot in America, who has never paid a cent&rsquo;s tax, whose ancestor never fought for America or never toiled for the nation.<br>
 And they actually have the gall to use that silly buzzword &#8216;protectionist&rsquo; (the general meaning is applied to tariff barriers on traded goods - not mass immigration)to descibe attempts to ration jobs in a time of rising unemployment.<br>

<p>Just how have whites benefited Mr. Murari?</p>
<p>The replacement of American IT workers with cheap Indian nationals will continue no matter how bad the recession becomes.<br>
That is the bottom line from &#8220;our&#8221; government and the big corporations. </p>

			<p>I wish I had the quote still but, some guy on a forum said that, due to globalization US companies no longer have to care whether the populace is healthy, well-educated, or productively employed; they&rsquo;ll just import workers from wherever education is good, and export work to where labor is cheap. Companies no longer care about the health of their host countries. And, corporations just about monopolize Washington&rsquo;s ear. </p>

			<p>There are no jobs here, but apparently we need immigrant workers to do the jobs we won&rsquo;t do&hellip;that happen not to exist right now.</p>
<p>Makes sense right?</p>

<p>Slavery may have been abolished in 1865 but a similar institution has been reserected in its&rsquo; new form in the use of cheap illegal labor in the USA or transporting work to far off countries where they don&rsquo;t have to worry about how workers are treated. It&rsquo;s the new neo-slavery. We only have greedy White American traitors in business and politics as well as the apathy of the American public to blame, sad but true. If the Founding Fathers could see America now&hellip;..</p>

			<p>When was the last time Steve Sailer wrote anyting negative about the predatory hindus and chinese in OUR America?</p>
<p>AS I written many times before here:ASIANS IN AMERICA ARE THE MORTAL ENEMY OF NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>
<p>The asians in OUR America are attempting to construct an economic case for the race replacement for Native Born White Americans. Do not ever debate the economic benefits of immigration. Just say:You are constructing an economic argument to justify reducing Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority withn the borders of America. I reject all arguments justifying the race replacement of Native Born White Americans withn the borders of America.</p>
<p>I want the asians out of America.</p>
