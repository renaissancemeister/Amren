<h1><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,589035,00.html">Austrian Journalist Slammed For Racist Obama Rant</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Der Spiegel, November 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Veteran Austrian television personality Klaus Emmerich has triggered a storm of criticism for his racist comments about Barack Obama, the US president-elect.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t want the Western world to be directed by a black man,&#8221; Emmerich said.</p>
<p>Klaus Emmerich has long been a figure in Austrian television news. His journalism career spans 61 years and includes a stint as a correspondent in Washington D.C. for ORF, Austria&rsquo;s public television station. He is something like the Wolf Blitzer of Austria.</p>
<p>Or, at least, he was. Now, the respected US expert has stained his own report card with a string of blatantly racist remarks regarding the election of Barack Obama in the US. Speaking on a talk show on the Austrian public channel ORF on Wednesday, he said: &#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t want the Western world to be directed by a black man. When you say that is a racist remark: right, without a doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Americans are &#8220;racists, now as before, and it must be going very badly for them that they so convincingly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. send a black man, and a black, very good-looking woman, into the White House,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Austrian broadcaster distanced itself from his views, saying it was against any form of discrimination. &#8220;We have never had any comments from Mr. Emmerich which would indicate he has such opinions,&#8221; Pius Strobl, head of communications at the channel told SPIEGEL ONLINE.</p>
<p>Following his outburst, the moderator prevented the now-retired Emmerich from having another chance to speak, Pius said.</p>
<p>But Emmerich himself voiced no regret. On the contrary, he even took a harder line in subsequent interviews. Obama&rsquo;s victory was an &#8220;extremely disconcerting development&#8221; he told the Austrian Standard on Wednesday, because &#8220;blacks aren&rsquo;t as politically civilized.&#8221; Meanwhile, he told Die Presse in an interview published on Friday that Obama has &#8220;a devil-like talent to present his rhetoric so effectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dieter Brosz, a speaker of the Green Party, was one of many riled by the comments. He urged the channel not to give Emmerich a platform again. &#8220;Racist remarks have no place on ORF and are to be avoided.&#8221;<br>

			<p>My own feelings after watching Whites surrender 400 years of self determination on The North American Continent were like&hellip; well like watching multi-culturalists skirt our Maginot Line. I watched with an even deeper dread than seeing Saigon fall on television as an eighteen year old. </p>

			<p>The word &#8220;racism&#8221; is just synonym which is used for the purpose of camouflaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism&#8221; actually means &#8220;Humans of European racial stock&#8221;.<br>
When you first hear my theory, it sounds grammatically incorrect but it is the truth!</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism&#8221; means that &#8220;blue eyed devils&#8221; &#8220;oppress&#8221; &#8220;people of color&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fighting &#8220;Racism&#8221; = Fighting &#8220;whitey&#8221;/&#8221;rednecks&#8221;/&#8221;gringos&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>If this Austrian journalist is against a non-European-American being the president of majority European-American America, then he is a racist.<br>
On the other hand Mugabe is not a racist, because he is not white. <br>
And Gandhi was also not a racist, because he was not white.<br>
And the Dalai Lama is not racist, because he is not white!</p>
<p>If you defend the European race, then you are an evil racist, of course.</p>
<p>The glorious media teach us, that the European race belongs to Europe only. <br>
And that America was &#8220;colonized&#8221; by greedy Europeans.</p>
<p>But the mass media also teach us, that the East Asian and the Indian races have a right to settle in North America and Australia, as much as the African and the Arab-Mulatto and the West-Asian-Caucasian races have a right to settle in Europe.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;racism&#8221; is a powerful sword of the propaganda of our enemies and we can only blunt it if we expose the meaning of this word.<br>
What your dictionary says about the word &#8220;racism&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t matter much.</p>
<p>WHAT DOES MATTER is the daily use of this word (&#8220;racism&#8221;)!<br>
And IN DAILY USE the meaning of the word racism SIGNIFICALLY DIFFERS from its lexicological meaning, as I have shown above.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours<br>

			<p>The article said Mr. Emmerich lived in Washington DC or Chocolate City as the blacks call it.  Maybe he learned his race realism there.  Maybe he rode a bus occasionaly with black teenage thugs on their way to school and listened to their cursing.</p>
<p>Maybe he was mugged a few times.  Certainly he knew people who had been mugged.  Certainly he had to deal with the totally disfunctional affirmative action DC city employees.</p>
<p>Why do ignorant liberals who have never been exposed to black behavior call race realism racism?  It&rsquo;s simple truth.</p>

<p>HURRAY!!!! Finally someone with a pair stands up and refuses to back down. How many liberals, blacks, hispanics, do we see apologizing? Very few if any. </p>
<p>I hear so many people saying we have to keep ourselves above the fray. I say let&rsquo;s get in and mix it up.</p>

			<p>A RACIST remark? Or simply a common-sense statement? With the sorry examples of Black city mayors in America, the even sorrier track record of those vaunted African &#8220;heads of state&#8221;&hellip; I&rsquo;d say Herr Emmerich knows of what he speaks.</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;re coming out of the woodwork. I&rsquo;ve long said that an Obama Victory would be a defining moment for the White Nationalist Movement. If the coming years of Black Rule in America don&rsquo;t convince Whites of the importance of race, I&rsquo;m not sure what will. I see three likely outcomes for our race. </p>
<p>The first, and the one I&rsquo;m hoping for is where the White Race wakes up in the next decade or so, and gets real about racial survival (i.e. racial separation). As I&rsquo;ve already posted in great detail the likely scenario I see for this happening, I wont use up space repeating myself.</p>
<p>The second possible scenario is where Whites wait until it&rsquo;s too late to realize the mistake we&rsquo;ve made. This would be something along the lines of 30-50 years from now, Whites really lose political, economic, and military power over the country due to declining birth rates and overwhelming immigration and high birth rates among non-whites. In this scenario, we would loose complete control over our country, but would still have sufficient numbers to separate from this racial-gumbo. We would lose most of our territory, if not all, but we would be able to maintain our race by consolidating in a small part of America, or fleeing north, and hopefully mount a successful comeback when the Hispanics and Blacks starve themselves to death as they inevitably do anywhere they go. If Obama doesn&rsquo;t bring about a White Racial Revolution, those of us who can see what&rsquo;s going on should consider moving to extreme Northern Canada or Alaska. I understand that Canada and Alaska are experiencing immigration problems, but the extreme cold and vast size will keep these places from being overrun the way America is currently being. The lower 48, and as a direct result, the rest of the world will collapse long before Canada and Alaska can be completely overrun. Our genetics make us more suitable to this climate, and we would eventually win out.</p>
<p>The third scenario would be just like the second, but instead, Whites would gradually die off as a race, and only a small handful of people like ourselves would be left racially intact. This scenario would leave us with too few numbers to ever really recover. Let&rsquo;s hope that doesn&rsquo;t happen. If it does, then we really aren&rsquo;t that great of a race, and we don&rsquo;t deserve to survive.</p>
<p>I take the optimistic view of our race that when presented with undeniable evidence that we&rsquo;re heading to extinction, the survival instinct in all of us will emerge. I know that a lot of you would say that the evidence is already in, and I do agree, but it still isn&rsquo;t universally clear. Until now, Whites have had visual control of this country. Obama changes that, and I can&rsquo;t help but think that this will start to wake a lot of whites up. I&rsquo;m rambling again, so I&rsquo;ll just stop myself here. My email address is included. Drop me a line.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;Western World&#8221; should not be directed by the American president.  I&rsquo;d rather have the USA run by a black libertarian than a white commie.  Unfortunately we have the worst of all worlds:  a non white marxist running a hegemon USA.  And remember, it was Whites who elected him.  </p>

			<p>Frankly, the way things are going, I don&rsquo;t think I want to see the world directed by a white man either. I do have to wonder if the forum in Austria had a point there, forcing Emmerich to shut up. Those are brave convictions &ldquo;Racist remarks have no place on ORF and are to be avoided.&rdquo; I guess that means they are going to avoid Obama from now on.</p>

			<p>I guess we can have a dual public hanging with this guy and the Prime Minister of Italy for their dissing of The One. Just maybe all the elites of Europe are not as thrilled about The One as we have been lead to believe. So far the PM has refused to apologize, we can only hope he stands fast and tells the world to get lost.</p>

			<p>It`s Starting-8:41pm Post Cheetos Update<br>
I had personally somewhat scoffed that we had it all wrong on the level of post election gloating that was going on till someone just rang my doorbell. It was a &#8220;guy&#8221; who said he was collecting for some kind of &#8220;brotherhoodfund.&#8221; Uh-huh.  When I gave him the standard  curt no-nonsense no nonsense reply, &#8220;We don`t accept solicitations!&#8221; he turned to my wife and asked in a friendly yet pointed way if she had voted for Obama. After I closed the door, I counted the scorecard. First, he was using the election and gullible White strategy to run a fundraising scam door to door. Also, in doing so he breached a very old and established neighborhood and socio-economic invisible barrier. Finally he felt cocky enough to spout off in a backhanded remark that there was a new day here. Hoo-boy! I said, &#8220;That wasn`t a base hit, it was a triple play!&#8221;</p>

			<p> Klaus Emmerich simply said out loud in public what many of us are saying guardedly among ourselves, or on websites like this one. And he was right. If this be &#8220;racism,&#8221; then make the most of it.</p>

			<p>Why the uproar?  If, by some freak accident of events, a white man ended up president of Congo and some Congolese leaders complained that they don&rsquo;t feel comfortable with a white man leading their country - would anybody bat an eye?  Let&rsquo;s face it.  Western Man is handing blacks the entire West on a silver platter.  He&rsquo;s saying, &#8220;Here!  Take my hard-earned civilization.  Please feel free to destroy my cities, degrade our quality of life and make us second-class citizens.  Oh, and while you&rsquo;re at it, please take our women and murder our children. You can keep Africa because whites have no right to be there.&#8221;  The above is exactly the attitude that the West has adopted.  So one public figure doesn&rsquo;t agree and behold, he&rsquo;s a &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>

			<p>People like Mr. Emmerich, whether others agree with him or not, are truly brave. It takes enormous guts to speak your views in a public forum that reaches millions. Compare this with the daily lives of people who believe the same thing but go around the office or work place in whispering tones.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t want this black man to run the western world. I have voted for black men as mayor of my town because I felt they were better qualified than their white opponent. I would vote for a black man as pres if he is qualified. I cannot think of any right now. As for BHO, He has yet to prove he is an american citizen.</p>

			<p>      Old men can say what they want. One of Tragedies of the<br>
West is that so few do. Our wise men are gone or silent. Per-<br>
pas a few decades of deceit has a dampening effect on the psyche.<br>
University Tenure was supposed to make it easier for men to speak<br>
their mind, but the conditioning has gone too deep in most cases.<br>
Also few men are brave eneough to risk social ruin. But, this<br>
Mr Emmerich is a good and brave old man. And not to old either.<br>
He may well have lots of time left to speak his mind. Bravo, sir.<br>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, if Obama proves to be the abysmal failure many predict he will be, blacks will blame it on white presidental advisers. If not, they will proclaim him a conquering hero. However, I am not holding out any hope for miracles with his trickle up economics, when small business owners face huge tax increases, aimed at benefitting welfare cases. Our economy is already in the mess that it is thanks to subprime loans being handed out to low income minorities. He wants to impliment the same types of policies. Joe the plumber has good reason to be concerned.</p>

<p>Hasn&rsquo;t this scenario already been/is playing out in Rhodesia and SA? White leaders in and of Prosperity and now the usual results with black leaders.</p>

			<p>There was a time when the white men not only had the will-power to rule the non-white world but they were also very blunt and freely expressed their strong points vis-a-vis the other races. </p>
<p>Then the desire to rule the other races was called racism and the blunt expression of pride and superiority was slowly eliminated too.</p>
<p>But now the white men&rsquo;s will-power to rule their own historical corner of the world is called into question and there is a campaign to intimidate them from freely expressing their desire for what is rightfully theirs.</p>
<p>The ones here obviously don&rsquo;t fall for it but it is our duty to open the eyes of as many as we can. We should act proud and we shouldn&rsquo;t be intimidated.</p>
<p>And the more of us push against the limits of this thought and speech prison the more the walls and the guards will become visible to the distracted masses.</p>
<p>This man sacrificed his career to do just that. Many more like him are needed. But careerism and materialism-induced cowardness prevent them from pushing against those prison walls though they share Klaus Emmerich&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p>Ironically we have something to learn from the anti-colonialist struggles because the West is facing an obvious agenda of colonisation. </p>
<p>Adopting an anti-colonialist stance as opposed to a &#8220;rule-the-wolrd-because-we&rsquo;re-best&#8221; stance would also placate the leftist opponents and turn their own weapons against them.</p>

			<p>Perhaps this gentlemen, after working nearly 61 years in journalism, has seen the results of black rule in many countries around the world.  One need only look at South Africa and several other African countries to see that putting a black in the driver&rsquo;s seat of a nation, has not produced positive results.  If anyone could show me even one nation, currently being ruled by a black, that is not embroiled in genocide, starvation, theft and every other kind of upheaval, I would welcome the information.</p>
<p>Having not traveled the world, I only can get my information from what I read about the world.  However, having lived in the United States all my life and lived through the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s and some of the worse race riots, I can tell you that I can&rsquo;t name even one American city that has been decimated by black rule.</p>
<p>I have resigned myself to the Obama election.  I don&rsquo;t see anything good coming from it.  I can only pray that he does the right thing for EVERYBODY.  We all know that things couldn&rsquo;t get much worse economically.  Of course, another stimulus (handout) of  money isn&rsquo;t going to solve anything and I understand that Obama is pushing quickly for another stimulus payout.  </p>
<p>Being a realist, I just can&rsquo;t get my mind around the fact that an overwhelming number of whites put him over the top to take the election and that the United States has become the FIRST predominantly white nation to elect a black man as it&rsquo;s leader.  I worry that with the state of race relations being what they have been for the past 40 years, what is going to happen to whites when we are finally in the minority.  I don&rsquo;t think a President Obama is going to make thiings any easier for us nor do I think that any new laws will be written to protect us.</p>

			<p>   Well, I am a blue-eyed devil. I am also 100% for my white race. So, I am a proud racist. I admit I am. I have been subjected to black and hispanic ideas of &#8220;humanity&#8221; for way too long. I have NEVER seen any thing good come from mixing the races, living amongst one another. In order for the white race to succeed and continue to exist, we must separate ourselves from the &#8220;minorities&#8221; in this country, including white liberals. We have no choice if we want to exist, it is that dire of a situation. Especially blacks, hispanics, mexicans, and muslims. Those minorities have no common goal with us. They are against us. They are each for themselves. Look at southern Kalifornia, the blacks and hispanics are butchering one another to gain superiority. At least they will fight for their own. I really don&rsquo;t understand what has happened to my white race, I am truly lost in the dark. Why aren&rsquo;t we fighting for our race? Why have so many of our people jumped ship to aid those whom would destroy us? Is it just for the greed? Do they think they will be rewarded by the minorities for their stupidity? Blacks, mexicans,etc. will look upon a white traitor with great suspicion. They do realize that race traitor whites will do anything, and are a danger to them also. Hopefully, they will get their just reward. If we as a race of white people cannot stand together and re-take our country, we need to look for another place to live. Do not allow your children to suffer your stupidity.  Millions have died for this country over the past 200+ years. Let&rsquo;s not allow these sacrifices to be in vain.</p>

			<p>We could always breed the minorities out, as the king in the movie &#8220;Braveheart&#8221; said. Having worked among these same minorities for years in foreign countries and in the U.S. girls that are pretty enough to aspire to a white husband, DO SO. These pretty women (and there are many of them) would rather mate with a white man than one of their own race in most every case, especially Asian women. Just a thought.</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;ve elected too many white &#8220;leaders&#8221; over the yeas who are not the best among us. It&rsquo;s a sort of Peter Principle in politics that we&rsquo;ve seen. Obama is the result.  We need a genuine spiritual/genetic revival among our people, and we need to become the white tribe against all, again. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, though, that once you do that, what you have left is not White.  No matter how &#8220;pretty&#8221; the woman may be, her descendants by her White husband will not be White.</p>

			<p>Why all the fuss about Obama?  Millions of Americans are willing to sacrifice everything to put this communist out of our misery.  It only requires one of them to succeed&hellip;  </p>

			<p>The problem with all these sudden outbursts of racial sanity (&#8220;racist&#8221; remarks) is that they are almost always hollow. There is no follow up. The people who make these statements never have a theoretical base to back up what they have said. Which is what makes it so easy for the media to denounce them as racist cranks.</p>

<p>Right you are, I don&rsquo;t do it. I still say Weapons are our friends, get them while we still can. I do believe that not far in the future weapons will be difficult or impossible to get legally.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t want the western world to be directed by a black man&#8221;,,,</p>
<p> Nor is there really any reason to. Europe has a much larger population and gross national product then America does. If the European countries were to cooperate a bit more they could easily chart their own course and reassert Europe&rsquo;s traditional role as leader of the west, or what was once called Christendom. There is no reason why Europe has to dance to America&rsquo;s tune. I would even go so far as to argue that an independent, assertive Europe would be a good thing for the world.</p>
