<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Identity politics in the Democratic Party are already presenting challenges to President-elect Barack Obama, who is under pressure to appoint Hispanics and African-Americans to key posts in his administration.</p>
<p>Both groups were crucial to Obama&rsquo;s victory last week over Republican John McCain. Ninety-six percent of African-American voters cast ballots for Obama, while 67 percent of Hispanic voters supported him, according to exit polls.</p>
<p>Both are now counting on Obama to appoint Hispanic and African-American politicians to his Cabinet as a way of rewarding their support.</p>
<p>New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Hispanic who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination but later endorsed Obama, should be secretary of State, a coalition of 35 Hispanic groups said in a Nov. 11 letter to the president-elect obtained by The Hill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The letter did not allude directly to the role Hispanic voters played in helping Obama win states such as Florida, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada, all of which went to President Bush four years ago. But it did congratulate Obama on his &#8220;historic and decisive victory&#8221; in the election.</p>
<p>Hilary Shelton, the director of the NAACP&rsquo;s Washington bureau, has called on Obama to appoint a Cabinet with more diversity than the Cabinets of Presidents Bush and Clinton. Shelton has also called for an African-American to fill Obama&rsquo;s Senate seat, a decision over which the incoming president is expected to have much influence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Blagojevich [Gov.[Rod Blagojevich of Illinois] will make the two-year temporary appointment, Illinois political insiders say that Obama will have significant influence over the decision.</p>
<p>Two members of the Congressional Black Caucus are vying for the seat: Reps. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) and Danny Davis (D-Ill.).</p>
<p>Obama is expected to assemble a racially diverse Cabinet. One Democratic insider told The Hill that Obama, aware of the importance of the country&rsquo;s fastest-growing group, is looking to surpass the bar set by Clinton, who appointed two Hispanics to his Cabinet at the beginning of his administration. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), an early Obama supporter, is widely seen as a possible pick as secretary of State. If Richardson gets the nod instead, it would bump the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee.</p>
<p>As the first black president, Obama will be under pressure to appoint African-Americans. But he may be under even more pressure to appoint Hispanics, whose support could prove critical to Democrats&rsquo; retaining power in Washington.</p>
<p>Democrats see an opportunity to seize and hold onto Hispanics after Republican efforts to do the same under President Bush were devastated by an inflammatory debate over immigration that was viewed by many Hispanics as racist in tone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Talk about Sen. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.) becoming secretary of the Department of the Interior is so loud in Colorado political circles that some in the state are already discussing who might take his Senate seat.</p>
<p>Guillermo Meneses, a Democratic strategist who advised Richardson&rsquo;s presidential run, said Hispanics are &#8220;certainly going to have an important role in the Cabinet,&#8221; given the way they supported Obama.</p>

		<p>The President-Elect&rsquo;s transition team has a seven-page questionnaire for applicants.  If the bar is raised high enough to weed out people whose past could prove embarrassing down the road (e.g., a criminal conviction or incident of domestic violence, unpaid taxes, or bankruptcy) very few blacks or Mestizos may make the grade.</p>
<p>Perhaps a holistic approach would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>Here we go boys and girls, the beginning of the end for General Secretary BO!</p>
<p>He will have a choice: to pick competent people (i.e., whites,)or trade in the worthless stock of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; Which cutting side of the razor, do you think he will choose?</p>
<p>We have the answer already, it is a plagiarist by the name of Senator Joseph Biden!</p>
<p>Keep going Comrade BO!!</p>

<p>Interesting, isn&rsquo;t it?  I mean since both the Idiot Prince and Bubbah the Adulterer crammed his administration with blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>I guess it means more to them to be appointed by a non-white.</p>

<p>From an honest commentator (John McWhorter), to complete liberal lunacy. Obama &#8216;owes&rsquo; his black constituents and must work hard to keep them? </p>
<p>What would be truly amazing about an Obama presidency, and yes, a wondrous &#8216;breakthrough&rsquo; chance to transcend racism, would be if Obama, in acting to break barriers, were to somehow lose the black vote. </p>
<p>How these same commentators would then turn on saint Obama, sounding like a rabid AmRener. </p>

As I said, this administration is going to be about pay-offs and pay-backs.</p>
<p>I also find it interesting that the Obama team is reconstructing the Clinton White House staff. Clintons indiscretions threw them into a tailspin so I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re going to make the mistake of leaving Obama alone for a second. They&rsquo;re going to be on him like stink on a skunk. If Obama needs extra-martial relief, they&rsquo;ll provide the entertainment. No more Linda Tripps or Monica Lewinskys if they&rsquo;re careful and lucky.</p>
<p>Of course, when you plug one leak, another pops up elsewhere. Only time will reveal any weaknesses.</p>

		<p>Do not think the left is satisfied. They will now push for the &#8220;first woman president&#8221;, then &#8220;first hispanic president&#8221;, then &#8220;first openly lgbt president&#8221; (see how that one goes over with middle eastern countries)<br>

<p>Obama has supported:</p>

<p>(B) Criminalizing white parents who refuse to let their children practice miscegenation.</p>
<p>(C) Using &ldquo;hate crime&rdquo; laws to silence any criticism from European Americans.</p>
<p>(D) Using Third World immigration to overwhelm European American majorities.</p>

<p>From evolutionary philosophy email list:  &#8220;Children of mixed, white-black, marriages identify 99% of the time as black and detest European Americans (whites).  Why?  They almost always look black (eye color, hair texture, nose shape, skin color, etc.).  Obama wrote:  &#8220;I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother&rsquo;s white race.&#8221;&#8221;  </p>

<p>Although it is difficult to imagine that we could learn any more new and disqualifying dirt about Obama than we learned in the last couple of years, I predict that the volume of impeachable dirt that flows out about Obama will be ten times more than Clinton. Of course, since nearly half of all Whites cherish Obama, it won&rsquo;t matter. Every charge will be dismissed as &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

<p>They will not for the simple fact that a good portion of whites in America are more terrified of being labelled a racist than they are of losing their country. This is not even taking into consideration the fact that most American&rsquo;s vote along pure party lines or with their emotion rather than with their brains. America is finished as a cohessive nation, the demographics change alone ensures this fact.  Our future is nothing short of a complete and totally corrupt third world hell hole or of balkanization along racial lines. </p>
