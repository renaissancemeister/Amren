<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7705922.stm">Councils Ban Use of Latin Terms</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, Nov. 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A number of local councils in Britain have banned their staff from using Latin words, because they say they might confuse people. </p>
<p>Several local authorities have ruled that phrases like &ldquo;vice versa&rdquo;, &ldquo;pro rata&rdquo;, and even &ldquo;via&rdquo; should not be used, in speech or in writing. </p>
<p>But the ban has prompted anger among some Latin scholars. </p>
<p>Professor Mary Beard of Cambridge University said it was the linguistic equivalent of ethnic cleansing. </p>
<p>Some local councils say using Latin is elitist and discriminatory, because some people might not understand it &mdash; particularly if English is not their first language. </p>
<p>Bournemouth Council is among those which has discouraged Latin. It has drawn up a list of 18 Latin phrases which its staff are advised not to use, either verbally or in official correspondence. </p>
<p>The council denies that it places a ban on Latin words. </p>
<p>A council spokesman said: &ldquo;We advise against using certain words, particularly when staff are writing to those whose first language may not be English. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The advice is intended as a guide only, not a direction.&rdquo; </p>
<p>However, the council&rsquo;s Plain Language Guide lists Latin under the heading &ldquo;Things To Avoid&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Other local councils have banned &ldquo;QED&rdquo; and &ldquo;ad hoc&rdquo;, while other typical Latin terms include &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo;, &ldquo;ad lib&rdquo; and &ldquo;quid pro quo&rdquo;. </p>
<p>But the move has been welcomed by the Plain English Campaign which says some officials only use Latin to make themselves feel important. </p>
<p>A Campaign spokesman said the ban might stop people confusing the Latin abbreviation e.g. with the word &ldquo;egg&rdquo;. <br>

			<p>Somebody needs to tell Bournemouth Council members that you can&rsquo;t fix stupid. If people can&rsquo;t tell what an occasional, simple Latin word means or if they can&rsquo;t tell the difference between e.g. and Egg, maybe thay need to go somewhere they can understand the language. <br>
Education probably won&rsquo;t help this situation much, after all how can you expect people with an average IQ of 85% (which means half of them are lower than 85%) to learn Latin when they have trouble grasping English, or even grasping the DESIRE to speak English&hellip;.</p>

			<p>I think the U.S. should also adopt this policy - and go a step further by banning the use of Vulgar Latin as well, otherwise known as &#8220;Spanish&#8221;.  It is elitist and unfair to simple people like me who don&rsquo;t understand it.  Yes, this would be taking it reductio ad absurdum, but to those who advocate such policies, I say caveat emptor.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true too. But the main culprits there always seem to be pompous Nebroes. </p>

			<p>It seems that if I can find the word Per Diem in my english dictionary then the word Per Diem is an english word.So it just sounds like we are just dumbing down the language on behalf of I.Q. challenged third worlders.</p>

<p>Rather ironic, considering the fact that Latin words are by definition not English.</p>

			<p>Before you vent your anger at the third world degenerates invading that green and pleasant land, note that it is the White marxists who have come up with this risible scheme.  I would doubt that any minority actually voiced a complaint.  A ban on Latin is nothing. Just wait for the ban on English.  It really is presumptuous and elitist, you know,  to expect someone to learn another language, especially one spoken by evil White racists.  </p>

			<p>After a ban on Latin, these same folks will be in favor of bilingualism - signs in two languages, as well making mandatory, customer service employees who are &#8216;multilingual&rsquo;. At least, for people of color who speak another language. </p>

			<p>My gosh, the left is really going all out to eradicate Western Civilization.  Nothing new here really, only now many people do not recognize it as such.  When the left found that that class warfare as a vehicle for the left&rsquo;s advancement in the first world nations was declining they started using the racial/ethnic minorities, recent immigrants, and white guilt as their way to power.  Just look at the Obama campaign!!!</p>
<p>When the left gains full control it may result in a Fahrenheit 451 type scenario.  And the Latin books will be burned first.</p>

			<p>I can understand the concept of not using SOME of those terms, but good God - not knowing COMMON ones like via, vice versa, or e.g. - like another poster stated, you can&rsquo;t fix stupid.</p>

			<p>This story makes me wonder who has infiltrated and hijacked the so-called Plain English Campaign. Probably the usual Common Purpose types, hell bent on making every organisation toe the multicultural/globalist line.</p>
<p>These cultural Marxists will use any ideological battering ram they can, be it official bilingualism in English-speaking Canada (although this is also - ostensibly - a kind of cultural bribe to the Quebecois not to secede) and constructive monolingualism in the UK (although perversely this doesn&rsquo;t prevent them from spending huge amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money translating official documents into every language under the sun apart from Latin).</p>

			<p>My kids have been taking Spanish lessons in the public schools since Kindergarten in the people&rsquo;s republic of NJ.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, there are no German, French, Latin, or ANY other foreign language classes offered all the way through high school.</p>

Another penetrating observation (as usual)!  Yes indeed, why not take it all the way?  In fact, why not add  to the list Hmong, Vietnamese, Haitian Creole, etc (all of which I see in public places)?   After all it is &#8220;offensive&#8221; to those of us  who are ignorant of these languages, and very embarrassing to have our ignorance constantly  rubbed in our face.  And heaven forbid that someone might be offended!!!</p>
<p>Unless, that is, we don&rsquo;t count as offendees.<br>

<p>Actually, the &#8220;problem&#8221; can very easily be fixed   &mdash;   with just the help of a dictionary.<br>
As my mother always said to me: &#8220;Look it up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, but that would require some common sense, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			<p>Reminds me of this age-old joke:<br>
In the good old days, you had to speak six languages if you wanted to work at an international hotel; now, you have to speak six languages to reside there (g).</p>
<p>This is just another case of dumbing down. You cannot go into science, medicine or jurisprudence (oops) without a modicum (oops) of Latin and a minimum (oops) of Greek. In all these cases, I´d rather have an &#8220;elitist&#8221;. The phrases they´re complaining about are standard usage enough to be considered plain English.</p>
<p>As English is not my first language, am I now required to &hellip; ?</p>

			<p>White skin is also considered by some as priviliged or aristocratic so why not discourage its existance, why not subsidize mischegination and tax white propogation. Greek thought and Roman law&hellip;who needs them?</p>

They&rsquo;ll ban SCRABBLE next. I&rsquo;m sure that discriminates against people that don&rsquo;t speak &#8216;the inglese&rsquo; as a first language.<br>

			<p>At this rate white babies will soon, by law, be permanently stained black or brown at birth.  I wonder how many white parents would object?  What will it take to galvanize whites into action against the traitors and invaders in our midst?  This is war&hellip;</p>
