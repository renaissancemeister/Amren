			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robin Stringer, Bloomberg, November 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A professor at the diplomatic academy of Russia&rsquo;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the U.S. will break into six parts because of the nation&rsquo;s financial crisis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Panarin said [Igor Panarin in an interview transcribed by Izvestia today] in the interview that the financial crisis will worsen, unemployment will rise and people will lose their savings &mdash; factors that will cause the country&rsquo;s breakup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dissatisfaction is growing, and it is only being held back at the moment by the elections, and the hope&#8221; that President-elect Barack Obama &#8220;can work miracles,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But when spring comes, it will be clear that there are no miracles.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. will fracture into six parts: the Pacific coast; the South; Texas; the Atlantic coast, central states and the northern states.</p>

		<p>The Drudge version of this article had Prof. Panarin claiming that the west coast would go to China and the American South to Mexico.  The trouble with the west coast is that there are so many Hispanics that a partition of the west coast by China would start a Hispanic-Chinese civil war.  As far as the American South, the whites there are the most racially conscious of all American whites, so an independent South would probably mean that the white run governments, free of Federal civil and voting rights acts, and Lincolnian occupation, would deport blacks and other non-whites.</p>

		<p>I think his remarks are spot on; however, the division will not be political as much as social and economic.  The South will prosper because of demographic shifts and cheap labor; the North East will continue to decline as well as the Mid-West (lack of manufacturing base); the plain states will survive, but not prosper, unless ethanol and alternative fuels become a hot item on Obama&rsquo;s agenda; the Pacific Coast states will be embroiled in immigration problems and out-migration, etc.  The Russians are in no shape, economically speaking, to lead anyone.  The real threat, both military and economic, comes from China.  These changes will be gradual but inevitable.  The Far East will eclipse the West within the next thirty years or so.  Our country will be ripped apart by multicultural forces that will exercerbate ethnic and regional differences.  Unity will prove to be illusory, although it will be ceaselessly repeated by the media and academics as the glue that holds us together.</p>
<p>Now that Obama has named a Hispanic to be his immigration boss, the great masses from Central America and Mexico (let&rsquo;s also add Africa to that mix)will increase in number.  I doubt they (new immigrants) will make sacrifices to shore up or be sensitive to the needs of the white community.  It may be too little, too late.</p>
<p>One little aside: please count the number of black males (or females) who are made the brunt of jokes in television or print advertising&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t found a single one, and I have been screening them.  It&rsquo;s open season on white &#8220;incompetence&#8221; and ineptitude.  Note than this is exclusively male to boot.</p>

I believe the US was a flame of hope that burned too brightly and too quickly. The great experiment appears to be reaching the end of it&rsquo;s life and usefulness.</p>
<p>The paradox of what made us great, that we could allow the US to be all things to all people, is what is leading to our demise. Radical egalitarianism by any means necessary is the steak through our heart.</p>
<p>If in the future, any white nation re-emerges, I hope to God they learn from the mistakes of our Forefathers. Slavery, while in the short run may make people wealthy, in the long run, is handing the axe to your future executioner.  </p>
<p>Our Forefathers made a deal with the devil and we, their great grandchildren, are left to pay off the debt. This is why I feel more anger towards Jefferson than Lincoln. Lincoln had to deal with the legacy of slavery. Jefferson KNEW what a future United States would look like with &#8216;two people, equally free&rsquo; and yet he allowed the practice of slavery to continue.<br>

		<p>     I can understand the frustrations of people. They feel the federal government is deaf, dumb, and blind when it comes to common sense and putting the needs of the whole country ahead of their petty aspirations. However, how long do you think the separate parts will be able to resist foreign aggression ? The Russians and Chinese are probably licking their chops over the prospects of a broken-up United States. Look at the recent voting results. Sure, it&rsquo;s disheartening that a goofus will be runnung this insane asylum for the next four years, but it was not an overwhelming victory that he achieved. Remember, we survived Jimmy Carter, Lyndon Johnson, eight years of Lover Boy and too many years of the Chappquiddick Swimmer. The break-up of this country will be so chaotic that we will not be able to survive it.</p>

		<p>Good! I strongly agree with Minister Panarin and welcome the coming change. There is no America left to feel patriotism for. </p>
<p>The truth is that it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until the nation&rsquo;s enemies and competitors dictate terms to her. </p>
<p>Ask yourself one question: What sane White person would want to die in defense of undesirables? The social experiment failed. It&rsquo;s high time to pay up.</p>

		<p>The sooner the empire is dissolved, the better. I hate to tell anyone, &#8220;I told you so&#8221;. But Secession chatter of old will become a thunderous yell for future survival. You will be given a choice. Serve the State or Serve your People. obammas civilian police force will consist of brainwashed Marxist. Your children, friends, neighbors and clergy will gladly accept these jobs to cause the country to split. It will be a real Civil War this time. For it will determine the make up of the entire country. Not just an illegal invasion of the South. I say, Secession Today, Secession Tomorrow, Secession Forever! DeoVindice</p>

		<p>&#8220;The U.S. will fracture into six parts: the Pacific coast; the South; Texas; the Atlantic coast, central states and the northern states.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this will all happen by the coming spring, when it is clear that Comrade Obama cannot work miracles; and of course Russia and China will become the stabilizing economic forces of the future?</p>
<p>I highly doubt this. This seems more like the rather demented wishful thinking of an America hating Russian buffoon, who does not grasp that his country is going to be hurt much worse than the USA will, if there is a true economic meltdown across the globe. Indeed, the USA might be an economic &#8220;pyramid&#8221; on the verge of collapse; however, Russia and China are still not without, at a minimum, secondary connections to that pyramid. Particularly China, which sells a majority of its &#8220;products&#8221; to the USA. </p>
<p>As for Russia, let&rsquo;s see how well the Ruble is doing compared to the Euro or British Pound, should the US Dollar become as worthless as the Mexican Peso? Or put another way, Russian oil isn&rsquo;t just going to become Fabergé eggs overnight, in such a destabilized economic scenario; if no Western power can afford it, or it starts to drop like lead from the sky in price&hellip;???</p>
<p>With that said, I can see the USA splitting into about 3 regions: Atlantic East Coast, Pacific West Coast, and the rest of the country, in about the next 10 to 15 years. I certainly do not see this happening by the spring of 2009.</p>
<p>Just which states will be attached to which region, who can say?</p>
<p>However, if I guess at it:</p>
<p>1.) the AEC, might end between New Jersey and Philadelphia somewhere, with DC attached to it one way or another;</p>
<p>2.) The PWC, will likely be Southern California and portions of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Nevada, along with most of the states of Washington and Oregon as semi-detached satellites, and of course most of Colorado as their fully detached East Prussia;</p>
<p>3.) The rest of the country, will be where all the sane white folks live and hopefully very few individuals &#8220;of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end however, who can really say?</p>
<p>Just ask the Trojans and Achaeans!</p>

		<p>This &#8220;breaking into six parts&#8221; idea is straight out of a book by a couple of Washington Post writers in the late 70&rsquo;s, or early 80&rsquo;s.  They imagined results of a small-scale nuclear war between US and Russia that decapitated both countries.  (Anybody remember the name?)</p>
<p>So much for this Russian &#8220;expert.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six countries way too many.  More importantly, as long as Washington DC is intact and the military continues to follow the federal government&rsquo;s orders, there will be no break up   &mdash;   no matter how bad the economy is.  </p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d predict that the WORSE things get financially, the MORE people will put their hope in Washington.  Rather than a breakup, I&rsquo;d expect more and more socialism/fascism.</p>
<p>Thomas Chittum&rsquo;s 3 racially-based states is a little more believable. (&#8220;Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America&#8221;)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I am not impressed by this prediction. First of all, is this professor expecting another Great Depression or just a recession? If a recession, then why a breakup if this did not happen in the 1930s? Is this professor racially aware enough to expect a breakup along racial lines, or are we just reading this into his comments? I notice he does not say anything about race. Also, he gives no rationale for his dividing lines. </p>
<p>If the country were to break up, I would not expect it to happen during my lifetime, and I&rsquo;m not old. Americans would have to become a LOT more racially aware than they are now for this to happen. In other words, don&rsquo;t hold your breath. </p>
<p>I would not expect an economic crisis to be a catalyst for a breakup anyway, but rather, racial conflict.</p>

		<p>People would be fools indeed to listen to even the most obvious sounding remarks made by any &#8220;expert&#8221; from russia.  At best, a state control media misinforms them in the most absurd manner.  At worst, they spout overt propaganda.</p>
<p>Ironically, it&rsquo;s russia&rsquo;s one commodity export economy that is burning right to the ground right this minute.  So convenient that is happening that one suspects that the economic difficulties in the US are manufactured.  A cold war.  Iran, venezuela, russia, china&hellip;.are all collapsing.  They simply may cease to exist as countries in a year or so.  Say what you will about the US, there are no anti government riots happening here.</p>
<p>That is not to say everything is all hunky dorey.  The election of Obama and the stranglehold the democrats have gained on our government is nothing short of a disaster.  The worst aspect being that Obama may not be eligible to even hold office.  Unless this issue is settled immediately, it risk our government losing legitimacy.  And that could cause an extreme backlash.  But not of the type Putin&rsquo;s dog is implying.</p>
<p>The US typically responds to instability in the world by becoming, for lack of a better word, fascist.  Americanism is a term from both prior world wars that may find itself being dusted off in the near future.  We got a taste of this immediately after 9/11 but it never went anywhere.  But the issue is quietly simmering on the back burner and could boil over at any time.  If that were to happen, the US would become stronger not weaker&hellip;..mobilized.  It would switch over from a peace time lethargy to a war time alignment of purpose.  It&rsquo;s happened before and it will happen again.</p>
<p>The likely focus of a third world war is the attempt of all western nations to expel hordes of third world invaders&hellip;.a resistance of a demographic war waged against us for decades now.  That could happen in europe any week now.  It could happen in the US if Obama is stupid enough to open our border and give amnesty.</p>

		<p>While it&rsquo;s not possible to know the entire scope of this professor&rsquo;s knowledge of the subject he&rsquo;s writing about, it&rsquo;s clear that basically he understands the gist of what is going on here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s made some erroneous points, though.  The Native Americans he mentions are such a small number as to be no factor in any kind of secession or partitition.  The same is true with the Asians in California.  He never mentions blacks at all.</p>
<p>In determining trends and influences in specific areas of the country he&rsquo;s not considering the most important factor of all, which is race.   Only in the Southwest has he considered the race problem correctly by accurately recognizing the Hispanic numbers there and that the tendency is for that area to go Hispanic.</p>
<p>As I said I don&rsquo;t know his entire hypothesis, but what he has presented so far is only partially accurate; however, the most important aspect of his observations is that this is the first time a foreigner has projected a breakup of this country, which to me means that the direction we&rsquo;ve been going is becoming so obvious it can be readily seen by people who don&rsquo;t know all the intricacies of this multicultural mess regarding contentious tribal fighting, but still see other points that are leading to breakup on their own.  </p>
<p>If he really knew how much this nation of tribes is involved in fighting amongst themselves, and that the situation here is really far worse than what he has observed so far, I&rsquo;m pretty sure he would be even more adamant of breakup, but would adjust his analysis to consider the race factor in determining how the split will occur.  Right now, whites in other countries really don&rsquo;t know the extent of black crime and ineptitude and are apt to think of them as victims rather than the perpetrators they are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing right now how accurate Pat Buchanan has been in his books and columns, as well as Tom Chittum in his book, Civil War II, plus many others saying almost exactly the same things.</p>
<p>And all of the authors who correctly foretold of this situation were declared doomsday theorists who were beset with wishful thinking.  There&rsquo;s no better way for an analyst to rebut his detractors than having them witness firsthand his forecasts coming true.  And all of them made reference to the fact that a multicultural society could NEVER survive the strain of an economic meltdown.</p>
<p>Well, the economic meltdown is here, in process right now,  and it looks like the whole world is beginning to see what has been so obvious to many of us here in this country for years now.</p>
<p>As the economic noose tightens the lower tiers will be getting impatient for assistance and when it never comes that&rsquo;s when the festivities will begin.  It&rsquo;s my belief the fighting between blacks/browns in the Southwest will develop into armed conflict and will have sporadic points of firefights throughout the country. Food riots, tax revolts, and the like, will all add to the chaos. </p>
<p>How it snowballs from there is anybody&rsquo;s guess.  We won&rsquo;t be fighting in the streets tomorrow, but we&rsquo;re working our way toward the grand finale right now.  Maybe 2012 to 2016?</p>

<p>I think I posted this a few months ago here, but it&rsquo;s especially relevant to your comment, so I&rsquo;ll repeat it. Jefferson made a statement about the South and slavery that &#8220;They have a wolf by the ear and can&rsquo;t let go.&#8221; In other words, although many Southerners were against slavery, what were they going to do with them?</p>

		<p>I think things will get interesting. I believe Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and the lower 4/5&rsquo;s of California are already lost causes. They will go to the Hispanics, either in a new official country or demographically. Even if the nation remains intact, this territory is already Atzlan.   </p>
<p>Blacks will get Mississipi, Louisiana, maybe a small region in southern Alabama, and likely South Georgia with North Florida. Black African-Americans will have a very good fight with Hispanics for Eastern Texas. </p>
<p>The wild-cards between us and Blacks will likely be Southern Arkansas, North Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Viginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and maybe even Pennsylvania. In a best case scenario, South Georgia and North Florida may be wild-cards for us. </p>
<p>Almost all of the rest could go to Whites, if they can contain non-White metropolitian areas and the urban street gangs therefrom. </p>
<p>I think everything will start not even locally, but from neighborhoods. Then, after a few weeks, in each area, events will form into the local scene, then the state level, and gradually national armies. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t endorse armed rebellion. This is an objective analysis of how things will likely go. But I will suggest that we make plans to defend ourselves from non-government armies from other races. Somebody has to keep the Nationa of Islam and &#8220;Kill Whitey&#8221; MS-13 in check. </p>

   I would like to see the midwest as an independant nation. We would put up trade tarrifs to rebuild our manufacturing and since we don&rsquo;t have give our money to the lazy other parts of the US, we will be prosperious and have low taxes.<br>
   Actually, I do not see the US breaking up anytime soon. While we have problems, the people have faith in their government. We just need AMERICAN leaders. </p>

		<p>There are, as I recall, 18 million Orientals in the U.S, a majority of them Chinese.  That&rsquo;s not enough people to grab and hold the west coast, particularly when the Mexicans hate them, and  White Americans, having had racial consciousness forced upon them, will finish off whoever&rsquo;s left after the Chinese-Mexican confrontation.  China is making a great effort to become a world power, but has come to the game too late.  Without lots of cheap oil, industrialization will remain at, or regress to, to the level of about  1850.  More sophisticated, but still a world powered by muscle, not electricity.  When the global economy stalls, China will be struggling to keep what it has going.  They won&rsquo;t be able to sustain a colony in North America against a hostile White population.  </p>

		<p>   Who can say when or how ? But the truth is, Balkanization has never worked in the history of the world and the Balkans have been a constant reminder of that. Diversity,supposedly our strength, brought down Rome and many lesser empires . And those that started out diverse, like the Huns, were little more than flashes in the pan . Were it not for their brutal barbarity and the meticulous record keeping of the Romans, the world would not now even know they ever existed . Back in the sixties when there were actually a few real conservatives left, we were warned this would be the result of the 1965 Immigration Bill and it&rsquo;s all coming to fruition now . The professor is at least partly right, the only way this country will be held together in the near future will be under an iron fist . Much like Yugoslavia under the Soviets . The light of the world is about to flicker out for the last time, all thanks to liberalism .   </p>

		<p>Why does any breakup have to be violent or chaotic?  Why can&rsquo;t we simply hold a national referendum on the issue and, if it passes, go about rationally partitioning the country?  Then like-minded people could migrate to those areas (three makes sense) that best suit them; i.e., we would self-sort.  It could be an amicable divorce similar to what I went through three years ago, where we were both richer for our eight years together but recognized that we were incompatible nevertheless.

		<p>This site has always postulated in one form or another that &#8220;race is destiny&#8221;, and I tend to agree with that. That is that in the long run, Race will out, that people eventually group with &#8220;their own kind&#8221;, and that is how it should be. Given that, I have to go with the scenario in Chittum&rsquo;s book CIVIL WAR II, in which the country breaks up into essentially three nations, real nations mind you, nations which are in the classical sense of the term, that is, groups which share the same genetic make-up. Chittum postulates that the West pretty much becomes Latino, the South becomes black, and the rest of North America becomes predominantly White. This occurs over a period of time, and involves some ethnic cleansing, most of it voluntary. that is to say, once people see the unfolding, they migrate to those areas where they feel most comfortable. Gee what a novel idea!!!! I, for one, like that scenario. Let&rsquo;s do it!!</p>

		<p>There are many countries around the world that would love to see the US break up. I guess they will give it all the help they can. In my opinion most of what happened in the 60s having to do with civil rights was because of communist intervention. The blacks never really had power but the US couldn&rsquo;t afford to let the communist see us as a divided country so it was just easier to give in to the blacks. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure that the United States would split up in the way described. In Canada, Quebec&rsquo;s been talking separation for years, but even hard-core separatists talk about &#8216;sovereignty association&rsquo;, which has been described as &#8216;divorce with bed privileges&rsquo;. Quebec is a net beneficiary of the Canadian federal government&rsquo;s equalization payments (designed to spread the wealth out evenly), and if it truly separated, it would find itself in a financial hole. That&rsquo;s why Quebec hasn&rsquo;t separated from Canada yet.</p>
<p>Sovereign nations full of people who can&rsquo;t support themselves or run a modern economy are doomed to fail. Look at Africa. They wanted independence from European colonialism, they got it, and now African countries are such disasters that black Africans are immigrating to Europe, America, Canada, and Australia - right back to the &#8216;white oppressors&rsquo;. If the southwestern United States ever became an offshoot of Mexico in name (Aztlan), it would be a recipe for disaster, and the new country would wither real fast as its citizens hoofed it over to whichever area of the former United States still had a white majority.</p>

		<p>In all the past demographic invasions in history, e.g. the Indo-european &#8220;waves&#8221;, the existing culture and people were simply overwhelmed and assimilated, apparently without a great deal of resistance or bloodshed.</p>
<p>So I predict that white America will fold up like a house of cards and disappear, except perhaps for a small core who will come to emulate the Jews.  That small minority will be wealthy, educated, influential and zealous about jealously preserving their racial/cultural heritage.  The rest of whites will be dispersed and assimilated.</p>

		<p> This is why I feel more anger towards Jefferson than Lincoln. Lincoln had to deal with the legacy of slavery. Jefferson KNEW what a future United States would look like with &lsquo;two people, equally free&rsquo; and yet he allowed the practice of slavery to continue.</p>
<p>  I agree with Varina. Jefferson would have liked to end slavery, but couldn&rsquo;t in the political and economic climate of his time. I personally don&rsquo;t care much for Lincoln because he illegally expanded the power of the executive branch, which is ultimately the cause of many of our current problems. More power for state and local government translates into more liberty for all of us  &mdash;  Jefferson knew that. However, I&rsquo;ll admit that both Jefferson and Lincoln (both race realists) would have been applauded by today&rsquo;s America.</p>

		<p>Along with the racial reasons trotted out, I would like to emphsize a central USA union with Canada would make real economic sense. That part of our country might even turn out to be prosperous; maybe we can hope after all. I think when the national discussion turns to the subject of what part of the USA would benefit from secession ( as in being &#8220;better off&#8221; )the whole era of Reaganesque optimism might return; a rebirth of conservativism, so to speak. Getting the government off of our backs, and getting rid of socialistic ideas once and for all will hold great appeal. First, though, the re-establishment of a viable third conservative party will have to occur. This may happen as the moral bankruptcy of Obama-style politics becomes plain to see. An undeniable transfer of wealth, in a context of diminishing wealth, to the constituents of the Democratic party will make it perfectly clear no two-party duopoly on politics can work and if this duoploy is essentially the same as the State itself that might spell the end of that State.</p>

		<p>This former patriotic flag waver could care less about what happens to America now.  America is a nation in decline and we&rsquo;ve been headed that way for 40 years now.  The source of our decline is diversity.  It&rsquo;s a pretty safe bet after the dust settles from the financial crisis that the US will no longer lead the world&rsquo;s economy.  The big player will be the European Union and investors will scramble to convert dollars into euros.  The source of America&rsquo;s superpower status, the dollar as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency, comes to an end.  Thus follows all the base closings around the world and all the troops in Europe and Asia come home.  America goes out not with a bang but a wimper.  In 20 years there will be so much unrest in this country and Whites on the verge of losing their majority status.  The treasonous government may indeed try to rule with an iron fist but America has so many enemies in the world that it would not be extraordinary for some American revolutionaries to negotiate with foreign entities for leverage against them.  Two Russian nuclear submarines off the coast of Maryland could do wonders for securing a White nation.  The government will back down. </p>

Certainly the U.S. is drifting apart, but next year seems way too soon, I agree. Maybe in a decade or two.</p>
<p>Race is a driving factor of the coming division in two ways. One: the demographic determinism that people talk about on here a lot, such as the streaming of Latinos into the Southwest and of whites out of it. </p>
<p>Two: If it takes decades of a decreasing white share for the population to spur the break-up, then perhaps most whites will no longer be able to ignore reality, and will huddle together on a large swarth of land (which piece, and how big of a piece, depends on how charitable whites feel). More likely, I think, whites will become increasingly divided on the race issue. In fact this is already apparent in the election results. In the Northeast and on the west coast, young whites were far more likely to support Mr. Obama than their elders. In the Southeast, and in some other isolated states like Alaska and New Mexico, young whites voted against Mr. Obama (no one voted FOR Mr. McCain) in greater numbers than their elders or at about the same rate. Though I see a polarization of young whites all over the country, there is an emerging regional divide, and so I think that the race-realist group will not wait for the rest to see the light. At a future time when the state is perhaps weakened, maybe by the demands of other separatists, this group will try to come together somewhere (the upper-confederate states, worming its way to the Great Plains states possibly) and try to force the gov. to recognize it as a sovereign state.  </p>
<p>And of course, there are reasons beyond race that could drive separation (tax distribution, religion, etc.).</p>

<p>Exactly. By all means, read and study up on our current situation all that you can, but never forget that history isn&rsquo;t something that just &#8216;comes about&rsquo;   &mdash;   it is always CREATED by people who have an agenda. Make sure that you at least try to take control of your own destiny. If things look dim on paper, then it&rsquo;s your responsibility to go the extra mile and see to it that the situation is made brighter. In reality, history has no place for whiners, despite the attention that they&rsquo;ve been given in recent decades by the decadent media in the US. </p>
<p>As for partition, not only is it likely, I think it&rsquo;s inevitable. Like clings to like; the only thing that is really keeping the US together today is the &#8216;iron fist&rsquo; of the government. Once the iron fist is gone, far-seeing individuals will FINALLY have a chance to actually carve a real future out for their people. Race will obviously be a factor, since it is one of the most fundamental forces of human life. IMO, healthy, intelligent, far-seeing US citizens who are of Germanic/Northern European descent should start organizing to prepare themselves for political autonomy and national independence. They have no genetic interest in preserving the colossal American state. FYI, the current American state has become a truly dysgenic force, and if it survives much longer it may compromise the very possibility of higher civilization altogether.  </p>
<p>The new state for Germanic/Nordish people in North America should be called &#8216;NEW GERMANIA&rsquo;. It should be built on the same exact principles that shaped our development in the &#8216;old world&rsquo;   &mdash;   that is, eugenic trends of the better elements outbreeding the lesser ones, the recognition of performance and demonstrated ability over &#8216;appearance&rsquo; and &#8216;sleight of hand&rsquo;, reinforcement of individual differences, openness to new experience and creativity, and plenty others. </p>

Sovereign nations full of people who can&rsquo;t support themselves or run a modern economy are doomed to fail. Look at Africa. They wanted independence from European colonialism, they got it, and now African countries are such disasters that black Africans are immigrating to Europe, America, Canada, and Australia - right back to the &lsquo;white oppressors&rsquo;. If the southwestern United States ever became an offshoot of Mexico in name (Aztlan), it would be a recipe for disaster, and the new country would wither real fast as its citizens hoofed it over to whichever area of the former United States still had a white majority.</p>

Absolutely correct. But that won&rsquo;t stop them from trying. </p>
<p>Whether they leech off us in our countries or whether they leech off us in carved-up subsections of our former countries, we need to face the fact that, either way, they ARE gonna be leeching off us. </p>

		<p>What really bothers me is that hispanics will end up getting our beautiful Southwestern states that have great weather while whites are forced to have a new &#8220;homeland&#8221; in northern states that have bitterly cold winters.</p>
<p>   While I understand that there are forces at work that have brought white people to this state of affairs, white people are really spineless if they give up the most beautiful, livable parts of the country to invaders.</p>
<p>   For that matter, what about military bases and nuclear power plants in the Southwestern states? Are they just going to be turned over to the invaders also?</p>

		<p>China is not interested in &#8220;colonizing&#8221; the United States, they have their own problems feeding and clothing their burgeoning  and newly materialistic populace, their not interested in care and feeding of spoiled G7 people.  Mexico can&rsquo;t get organized enough to control their own drug dealers.  </p>
<p>Things will economically get worse to the point where  martial law may be  possible.  Hate crimes will become onerous and ubiquitous, kind of like Titos Yugoslavia.  If the central government becomes weak THEN racial tensions will erupt.</p>
<p>Whites initially after years of passivity will sheepishly get slaughtered as is now the case in S. Africa (and in a certain sense via crimes, here) until some catalytic event (such as slaughtering a whole school of white children or something of that manner) galvanizes the race and makes it acceptable to have a &#8220;Quasi white leader&#8221;.  I say quasi because after SO many years of racial denial, white racial identity in the mainstream will have to take many &#8220;baby steps&#8221; until fully realized.</p>
<p>This is going to be a long, complicated and drawn out process as we return to fundamental principles that our forefathers readily embraced for PRAGMATIC reasons.  The coming economic event will FORCE return to practices abandoned due to a buffering credit bubble which negated many of these so called &#8220;progressive theories&#8221; and their detrimental affects on society.</p>
<p>Economic and social principles can only be manipulated for so long before their affect &#8220;whipsaws&#8221; back in the opposite and corrective direction.  Without the central government, there is no cohesive force that keeps this country together.  Social institutions formed on a grass roots level have long disappeared in favor of a centralized, in-efficient, dis-interested,      bureaurocracy held together buy over-paid government officials which will evaporate in the current climate, necessitating re-establishment of those institutions  which more than likely will be based on race.  This wont even be a conscious effort it will just happen.</p>
<p>Peoples seeking assistance of these institutions will determine the make-up of the affiliated communities which will also most likely be determined by race. Thus by proxy, segregation will happen without actually forcibly doing it.  Racial pockets within these areas that are not in the majority will find it very uncomfortable and unwelcoming making it beneficially acceptable to move elsewhere.</p>
<p>This whole process can happen amicably if allowed. If not, expect heavy imposition of central government control, suspension of rights etc. until eventual collapse and then violent realignment s.</p>

		<p>The United States as we have known it is gone.  Actually it left us sometime around 1970.  The single most destructive force in this county is our public education system.  There are millions and millions of white people who believe that mutliculturalism, leftist liberalism, feminism, socialism, are all good.  They have been raised by feminist mothers without a father or a father that is as much a feminist as the mother and none of them are religious.  Half of the white population has been brainwashed into believing all these &#8220;progressive&#8221; changes are good for them when in fact they are leading them to their death.  The cliff is close and soon many will fall to their death.  And it is not just east coast liberals.  I was recently visiting relatives in Indiana and they seemed shocked when my wife and I started talking about race and the coming end to the US.  Their jaws dropped when my wife told them they should stop watching all those underserving blacks running around with a ball and making millions from doing nothing that helps this country.  And all the while millions of white men sit there and look up to them as sports GODS.  SHAME!!!  Now the other half within the white polulation has some hope.  Education is the key.  Private school is the only hope for white children.  If you can&rsquo;t afford private school then home school must be the choice.  If you have children, start now.  If want your children to have a fighting chance in the future then you must keep them from the brainwashing factories of academia.  It works.  Our daughter is now in a private college that still has convservative values.  The US may be lost but there will be a white civilization in the future and we must be prepaired to go forward as white people.  Remember, whites have been outnumbered for our entire excistence.  The ingrediants that built the westewrn world are still present in white men and women.  So for the near future we must live as white as possible with pride and take every opportunity to spread &#8220;Our Religion&#8221;  People will listen.  Those relatives in Indiana called the other day and said that our conversation got them thinking and they agree with us.  It works, talk about being white and all the good that surrounds the white race and point out the problems this country faces because of Africans, Mexicans and other third world people.</p>

And when you&rsquo;ve done all that you can rescue Canada for the white world and add nine of its ten provinces to your confederacy - the other, Quebec, should be allowed to become a fully independent French Republic to prevent it becoming as much of a thorn in your side as it is in Canada&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The threat we face, my friend, is not directly from minorities. Sure, they are unwittingly used as the instruments of our destruction, but the architects of our nation&rsquo;s destruction were (and still are) White people. </p>
<p>White people have exclusively fueled and driven the rise of Blacks, Hispanics, and Muslims in America.</p>
<p>Whites failed to repatriot Blacks after the civil war. Whites granted voting rights to minorities. Whites drove affirmative action and civil rights. Whites allowed Hispanics to overrun the nation. Whites elected a Black president.</p>
<p>Whites could end the charade of multiculturalism and diversity tomorrow if we chose to. We could restore the nation to prominence if we chose to. We could eliminate all undesirables from the nation and repatriot them to their native lands if we chose to&hellip; but we will not. The reasons are a self-destructive blend of selfishness, greed, and altruism. </p>
<p>America should and could be a White nation with a rich cultural heritage. It never will be because the most prominent Whites succeeded (and still succeed) by using the cheapest labor sources and having the least intelligent patrons who buy products without questions. Blacks, Hispanics, and Muslims satisfy both sets of criteria.</p>

		<p>&#8220;China isn&rsquo;t handicapped by the Sierra Club or the greenies.  China can build as many nuclear power plants as it wants.  China has shown that it can become world class in a period of two decades in areas it deems important.&#8221;  2:47 PM.<br>
     China has advanced so rapidly because they have been adopting technology already developed elsewhere.  Kind of like taking a test when you&rsquo;ve already paid for the answers.  Not that they can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t continue to progress, but at a much slower rate than in the past.  And they will not escape the collapse of the global economy when the oil runs out.  Atomic power will not make up for the lack of oil, because atomic energy is dependent on cheap fossil fuels.  All the mines, for iron, uranium, copper, and exotic materials that are needed to build and run nuclear reactors, run on fossil fuels.  All the transport that move the stuff from mines to mills run on fossil fuel.  The mills that turn ores into metal run on fossil fuel, and the factories that form the metal into pieces of reactors and all the other necessary parts of the system run on fossil fuel.  When you have to use atomic energy to generate electricity to sustain the nuclear industry, as well as all the other power needs of the country, there won&rsquo;t be enough to go around.  <br>
     Nor will China save itself with other energy sources.  Like atomic energy, &#8220;alternative&#8221; energy technologies have been developed using cheap fossil fuel.  Their contribution to the world&rsquo;s power needs is marginal and local.   If windmills, geothermal energy and the like were so efficient, there wouldn&rsquo;t so many coal, oil, and gas fired power plants all over the world.<br>
     The upshot of all this is that while China is racing like mad to secure all the resources possible, they will, like the rest of the world, have to adjust quickly to energy scarcity.  They won&rsquo;t be able to maintain American colonies any more than we&rsquo;ll be able to support Taiwan or Korea in any confrontation with their much larger neighbor.  The period of Chinese imperialism in North America will be shorter than that of the British in Africa, and they know it.  Right now they are just trying to grab as much technology as they can, while they can.  <br>

<p><br>
In response:</p>
<p>I agree.  That is my point.  White liberals pushed by a social engineering agenda are the problem.  As is usually the case we are our own worst enemy.  We are a compassionate people.  Most of us have been raised to give people a chance to succeed.  Combine that sentiment with leftist liberals of all stripes and you get where we are today.  The basic truth that must be exposed is that non white people are not like us.  A small number of them may be but the majority are not. And the small number of blacks and other minorities that are somewhat like us, except for the Asian, are just mimicking us.  There is no real understanding of what white western civilization is.  That is why you get affirmative action black managers that are more concerned with the suite and shoes they wear than the profit and loss of their company or division. </p>
<p>We have been raised to think skin color does not matter and in reality it has nothing to do with the skin.  Has to do with the inteligence, culture, natural insticts that are not like ours that make the difference.  </p>
<p>Now what to do?  We must be honest withourselves.  We must get to a point where white people can have open dissent against the multucultural agenda that is pushing us to the brink.  When that happens and it will, we will begin to take back our country.  The dissent may not come until we have felt real pain and suffering but even white people brainwashed my the marxist social engineers have an instinct for survival.  This is where those of us that are not drinking the cool aid must work to convert our confused family and friends.  We must talk about what western civilization has created: electricity, phones, cars, planes, computers, plumbing, democracy, capitalism, and the list goes on and on.  Only the Asians can compete with us. And speaking of the Asian, they have no guilt.  China is openly working to colonize Africa.  They don&rsquo;t care about the poor blacks, they only look at them as a group they can take advantage of and they are. We must take a simular approach.  We do not have to hate blacks and other minorities but we must put our people first.  They put their people first. Why not us.<br>

<p>Keep in mind the Russian&rsquo;s opinion comes from the same group of people that believed a national centralized economy would work and killed 6 million people (a rough estimate of Stalin&rsquo;s work) trying to pull in off. </p>
<p>Moreover, the silent majority of Americans love US too much to stand for seeing its unity or  constitution cast a side. The greatest skill of the American people is &#8220;teamwork&#8221; and this great strength should never be under estimated.  No challenge will ever be too great for our nation to overcome. </p>
<p>Just as countries such as France and China, that have experimented with socialism and communism, witnessed its folly (i.e. it sounds good but it doesn&rsquo;t work),and turned back towards a free economy; so will America. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The &ldquo;literary gimmick&rdquo; of the book I remember reading was that it was supposedly a report written by two journalists traveling through a divided US after a limited nuclear war. As I remember, DC and NYC were wiped out. (One city getting swamped by tsunami from a near miss in the Atlantic, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken.) Also, all electronics were fried by high-altitude EMP bursts. As a result, without leadership or communication, US had broken apart into its &ldquo;natural&rdquo; parts. </p>
<p>I remember that the Pacific Northwest was guarded by fences &amp; eco-nazi patrols to keep out immigrants and preserve the environment.</p>

<p>China, like America, is not going to let modernity slip through it&rsquo;s fingers and become Africa. The Plutonium breeder reactor exits and France uses them. Did you know that &#8220;During the 1990s China conducted underground hydronuclear experiments &mdash; though not full-scale device tests &mdash; for France at Lop Nur.&#8221; ( https://ptonline.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_61/iss_9/47_1.shtml ) Huge amounts of U-238 exist already, such that the USA can afford to shoot them at our enemies (Depleted uranium); this is the raw material for creating Pu in a breeder reactor. So I don&rsquo;t buy the argument about how a nuclear powered China is limited by fossil fuels.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;IMO, healthy, intelligent, far-seeing US citizens who are of Germanic/Northern European descent should start organizing to prepare themselves for political autonomy and national independence. They have no genetic interest in preserving the colossal American state. FYI, the current American state has become a truly dysgenic force, and if it survives much longer it may compromise the very possibility of higher civilization altogether. <br>
The new state for Germanic/Nordish people in North America should be called &lsquo;NEW GERMANIA&rsquo;. It should be built on the same exact principles that shaped our development in the &lsquo;old world&rsquo;  &mdash;  that is, eugenic trends of the better elements outbreeding the lesser ones, the recognition of performance and demonstrated ability over &lsquo;appearance&rsquo; and &lsquo;sleight of hand&rsquo;, reinforcement of individual differences, openness to new experience and creativity, and plenty others. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And we desperately need to make sure that no Irish, Italians, Hungarians, Greeks, Portuguese, French, or Slavs of any sort make it into New Germania.  We also need to ensure that all New Germanic citizens are at least 15/16 Nordic by blood  &mdash;  else the whole enterprise is an utter and complete waste.  If there is so much as a single guy surnamed &#8220;Tucci&#8221; anywhere on the census, we might as well just open the floodgates and elect Malia Obama president.</p>

<p>I am sorry, to disagree with you, Voter, but I beg to differ. For the most part, the Inland Southwest (not along the California coast) is a big desert. Deserts have temperature extremes, ranging from extreme heat, and the extremely cold. It&rsquo;s hotter and colder than Florida. This also makes it unstable for crops. There is also a strong lack of water in the desert, especially as there is a projected major water shortage in this particular region, within the next generation. </p>
<p>This is hardly rich and productive agricultural land. The ideal soil is more likely to be present in the Southeast, Great Plains, and maybe Pacific Northwest. <br>

<p>Professor Rummel, in Death by Government, estimates that 61,911,000 were murdered in The Soviet Gulag State.</p>

<p>In 1932-1933, &#8220;seven million Ukrainians were starved to death in the breadbasket of Europe. </p>
<p>At the same time the Soviet regime was dumping 1.7 million tons of grain on Western markets. The famine was engineered by the Soviet regime&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>I agree with your post that we should take no advice from Russians.  They would like nothing better than to watch the US economy implode (as theirs did)  &mdash;  and then sit back and laugh at and mock us (as we did to them) and then support our enemies (as we did to them) and then surround us militarily (as we are surrounding them with NATO). </p>
<p>Russians are a proud people with long memories, watching out for themselves (as we should for ourselves, but fail to do).</p>

		<p>And, you&rsquo;re neglecting to mention, some of the world&rsquo;s richest and most productive agricultural land.&rdquo;<br>
Posted by voter </p>
<p>I am sorry, to disagree with you, Voter, but I beg to differ. For the most part, the Inland Southwest (not along the California coast) is a big desert. <br>
EA Steve<br>
======================</p>
<p>I still disagree.  I&rsquo;ve read that California produces 1/3 of all the vegetables grown in the USA; Los Angeles County produces the most milk, etc.   Yes, it is semi-arid, by nature,  but the land is rich and the growing season is long. That, combined with irrigation, has made it immensely productive. The same can be said of Arizona, much of it formerly desert but now very productive when brought under cultivation.</p>
<p>This is very valuable land.  The Central Valley of Calif. is one of the world&rsquo;s most productive agricultural regions -  and in an increasingly populous world, clamoring for food, it is too valuable to abandon.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll break up into seperate countries, but I firmly believe that we are in steady decline and that we are experiencing two-thirds of a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; of insurmountable problems.  <br>
1.  the massive shift in demographics that will spell the end of conservative politics<br>
2.  the economic crisis</p>
<p>I believe the third leg of the perfect storm will be when we are militarily attacked by a country or countries that perceive us as being weak. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Kevka: If you want a real eye opener document the paltry number of white immigrants allowed in the country the same census year. Washington clearly has an agenda to close the door to foreign whites while drowning us with the dregs of the entire third world. Of course all the numbers pale when compared to the millions of Hispanic illegals invading this country every year because Washington refuses to enforce our immigration laws&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I think you should face the reality that first world people don&rsquo;t want to move here anymore.  I don&rsquo;t even want to live here anymore.  Immigration from Europe has steadily dwindled since the 60s because the standard of living has been rising there to the point where there are many places in Europe where people live better than in the US.  Add on the generous social benefits including free health care, fewer working hours and throw in more racial homogenity, why would any European want to come here?  Especially knowing they&rsquo;ll be a minority in 35 years and their kids will go to our awful public schools and be exposed to blacks and Mexicans.  Those people that are moving out of Europe are choosing destinations like New Zealand and Australia</p>

Human nature takes the path of least resistance which means that people of a given race will just migrate to areas that have people like them&hellip;it&rsquo;s happening now,it is a natural method that &#8220;defuses&#8221; the friction.<br>
It is slow and inexorable but happening at this moment,the only way that a race war would occur is if you have violent invasions of different races who attempt to subjugate the others with force and attacks which is unlikely due to the extensive level of gun ownership amongst Caucasians.</p>

<p>Lol, I guess I should have seen that coming, seeing as how this is Amren. Forgot where I posting for a moment.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t have anything against non-Nordish/Germanic peoples, but it&rsquo;s totally foolish to think that some sort of ambiguous, all-encompassing &#8216;White&rsquo; category is legitimate in any sense. No European populations have ever really thought of themselves in this way; the false &#8216;White&rsquo; category only came about in response to the sharp differences between certain Nordish populations and native Indians and African slaves when this continent was initially being colonized. It isn&rsquo;t valid in a racial sense, just this particular social context. </p>
<p>Plus, it isn&rsquo;t even valid in a cultural sense; what &#8216;culture&rsquo; has been created by &#8216;White&rsquo; people. Europeans have created many different cultures with a wide variety of characteristics. The culture of Americans, for instance, up until the 20th century was essentially an English-derived model to which other Northwestern European people tried to fit into. It worked for awhile, but after too many differing types arrived it became impossible to uphold. </p>
<p>Amreners are obsessed with trying to homogenize the European peoples into a neatly packaged &#8216;White&rsquo; group, as if no differences existed between the various populations of Europe. Pretty foolish, IMO. Like I said, I don&rsquo;t have anything against any particular European group, but in order to maintain THEIR unique cultural and spiritual characteristics, Northern Europeans shouldn&rsquo;t lump themselves together carelessly with other groups. </p>
<p>As for &#8216;New Germania&rsquo;, the situation is unusual in North America because of the immigration patterns throughout the last century. The state in North America would automatically be characterized by at least some level of diversity, because of the close historical interaction between disparate peoples that has been the rule for such a long period of time. Thus, &#8216;New Germania&rsquo; would be overwhelmingly Northern European, with roots being traced back to a variety of Northern European countries (most common being England, Germany, Holland, etc.), but with a dominant Germanic culture. Some people from the groups you mention might qualify, but on a case-by-case basis, with the most valuable types being admitted (as any healthy state should do). </p>
<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t understand how Amreners can see it otherwise. Why would anyone want to homogenize the so-called &#8216;White&rsquo; world? What reason is there to want to homogenize peoples as different as Swedes and Southern Italians? Furthermore, what historical precedent is there for success of such a &#8216;pan-European&rsquo; racial state?</p>

<p>I mentioned non-Coastal California and the rest of the geographic Deep Southwest. The Pacific Coast is very rich, in agriculture, but I am afraid most of it is a lost cause. However, there is a silver lining for CA. If we play our cards right, we will likely win the upper 1/5 of CA. Naturally speaking, most of Arizona, New Mexico, and Southern &amp; Western Texas are a big desert. There are few oasises and exceptions here and there, but it has its reputation for a reason. In the Summer, it&rsquo;s hotter than even Florida. In the Winter, it can easily get colder than the Carolina&rsquo;s. It is very differnt from what our ancestors and we are adapted to. The Southwest is also the most dangerous place for us, as we would be cut off from Europe, and trapped by Hispanic Nationalists and potentially Chinese colonizers. Realistically speaking, I advise all Whites to leave TX, NM, AZ, and the lower 4/5&rsquo;s of CA now!</p>
<p>I think these areas are a lost cause, demographically; however, I still respect your sentiment. Although very far from my ideal, and very far from which I see as what we need first and foremost, I will agree it is a precious area (especially Coastal CA); I am just suggesting what I perceive as a very pragmatic move. <br>

<p>I agree, I wouldn&rsquo;t want all of my descendents to be absorbed by a completely foreign ethnicity (even within the White race). </p>
<p>However, how productive is your ideal? It was this sort of intra-racial ethnic divisiveness that helped get us into our current demographic crisis to begin with. It was the persecutions against the Irish, Slavs, Italians, and Jews, that made ethnic voting blocs vote against their racial genetic interests. The Kennedy&rsquo;s make a great example for the racially &#8220;liberal&#8221; Irish! Over what amounts to what I believe is at least a 100 years, of American ancestry, and yet many of the Irish still got pushed into the &#8220;liberal&#8221; side. I believe a majority of Italians are also die-hard &#8220;liberal&#8221; Democrats. The Jews have faced so much persecution, and been reminded of the Holocaust almost since birth. As a result, many naturally feel morally obligated to be racial &#8220;liberals.&#8221; And yet, their expressed empathy and innocent intentions get misinterpreted as deliberate and intentional racial treason! (Go figure.) </p>
<p>My whole point is that we cannot afford to divide our race on this continent. If we persecute, or even hurt the feelings of one of our ethnic groups, they could feel pushed into siding against us, knonwingly and maybe even unknowingly. </p>
<p>I support a &#8216;de facto&rsquo; &#8220;limestone effect&#8221; (of some intra-racial ethnic groups) in some small regions and counties; however, we must remain socially and morally united, if we are to prevail!</p>

<p>But do you think the hispanics will be able to maintain the irrigation system?  Look at the infrastructure of Latin American countries.  It&rsquo;s a mess, compounded by corruption.</p>
<p>Look at what has happened to California since about 1975 when the hispanic hordes began their take over.  I was talking to some Australian tourists in S. California last week.  They don&rsquo;t even go to Los Angeles anymore, they claim it is more and more like poverty stricken Calcutta every year.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have much hope for the irrigation system that turned California&rsquo;s desert into productive agricultural land once the hispanics take over.</p>

		<p>We are going to have everything we greedily gathered taken from us.  </p>
<p>Obama is doing exactly what he said he would do and that is redistribute the wealth.  He is going to have this country function in the fashion he understands and that is do for everyone because the government knows better, make everyone equal because we are all equal, give more and more control to the government and on and on.  There is no need for innovation or charities only for the government.  It is welfare and more welfare and on a global scale.  We created the black welfare group, all of us in America, because everyone seems to be unable to discuss race and work through it.  So, we pushed it under the rug and now it is emerging.  </p>
<p>When all of the money is gone (shortly) the scenario predicted here will take place.  America might well become a place only suitable to be inhabited by demons.  </p>
<p>What no one told all of YOU that voted in his sort of lunacy is that he failed World History, or at least the part about the USSR and that they failed, as has every other socialist government from the beginning of time.</p>
