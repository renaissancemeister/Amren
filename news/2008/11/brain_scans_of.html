<h1><a href="https://www.futurepundit.com/archives/005665.html">Brain Scans of People Full of Hate Show Unique Hate Signature</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Randall Parker, Future Pundit, October 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Coming from Professor Semir Zeki and John Romaya of the Wellcome Laboratory of Neurobiology at the University College London, a new research paper in Plos One on how hatred activates and deactivates areas of the brain shows hate creates a unique pattern of brain activates which includes some overlap with brain areas activated by love.<blockquote>In this work, we address an important but unexplored topic, namely the neural correlates of hate. {snip} The study thus shows that there is a unique pattern of activity in the brain in the context of hate. {snip}</blockquote>Hatred does not activate the amygdala which is activated by fear. <blockquote>It is important to note that the pattern revealed is distinct from that of other, closely related, emotions such as fear, anger, aggression and danger, even though it shares common areas with these other sentiments. {snip} It would thus seem that, though these sentiments may constitute part of the behaviour that results from hatred, the neural pathways for hate are distinct.</blockquote>Parts of the brain involved in motor function get activated &mdash; perhaps so one can move in and attack the object of one&rsquo;s hate?<blockquote>{snip}</blockquote>{snip} While love shuts down areas of the brain associated with judgment and reasoning by contrast those consumed with hate have very active reasoning facilities. It takes logic to figure out how to attack your enemy. So that makes sense. Only those in love thing they can afford to let their guard down, become zombies, and feel bliss around the object of their affection.<blockquote>&#8220;A marked difference in the cortical pattern produced by these two sentiments of love {snip} But whereas in romantic love, the lover is often less critical and judgmental regarding the loved person, it is more likely that in the context of hate the hater may want to exercise judgment in calculating moves to harm, injure or otherwise extract revenge.</blockquote>In countries where suspected criminals have no right to privacy or right to keep silent brain scans could be used to determine whether a suspected killer hated his victim and by how much.<blockquote>&#8220;Interestingly, the activity in some of these structures in response to viewing a hated face is proportional in strength to the declared intensity of hate, thus allowing the subjective state of hate to be objectively quantified. This finding may have legal implications in criminal cases, for example.&#8221;</blockquote>One could imagine a police state in which opponents of the regime get tested with brain scans and pictures of dictators to identify enemies of the state. With more time it will become possible for governments to turn hatred into love. Then all enemies of the state will get turned into supporters of it. Of course, individuals will try to do this on a smaller scale as well.</p>

<p>One doesn&rsquo;t need to imagine such a society.  It&rsquo;s already here, any given country which dedicates itself to diversity and equality as its prime defining virtue.  Most white countries today fit the mold.  I wonder what Randal Parker thinks about civil rights.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Those consumed with hate have very active reasoning facilities&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have so many hate laws, we can&rsquo;t have those reasoning facilities activated. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what they are calling hate, I don&rsquo;t really hate anyone but I do keep my guard up in many situations and I sure as heck don&rsquo;t trust or love the government. </p>
<p>What they call hate may be what I call good judgement. A picture of any of our last three presidents and some of the want-a-be&rsquo;s would get my blood pressure up. </p>

			<p>This use of brain scans was investigated in the film &#8220;Minority Report&#8221; that opened with a cuckolded white man prevented from murdering his adulterous wife and her lover. Of course, his suspended animation for life was acceptable. But when applied to others, it had obvious dangers.</p>
<p>The release of the BNP party list provides the first guinea pigs for this type of treatment. Luckily even left wing organisations like the British Teachers&rsquo; Council cannot overlook the dangers of persecution for membership of political parties. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean to say they won&rsquo;t keep tabs of those guilty of BNP membership, something apparently worse than being a paedophile, whose names are not yet publicised. </p>
<p>They have been able to recognise the functions of the amygdala for many years, but to decide when and who it is appropriate to hate or feel rage has never before been a preserve of science. Governments have exploited these emotions, usually to urge peoples to defend themselves. Now the knowledge is about to be used to manufacture psychoses to certify those who resist policies designed or at least resulting in values and social fabric we have been expected to die for in the past.  </p>

<p>And if the white detainee shows no sign of hate when shown photos of Obama and Joe Biden, he will then be shown images of non-whites, gay couples, Muslims in burqas, etc. to see if he should do jail time for &#8220;prejudice&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Perfect.  This means that the 98% of Blacks who voted for Obama because they hate White people can now go to jail for &#8216;hate&rsquo; crimes.  We can&rsquo;t keep them in jail for robbing, murdering, and raping White people for any reasonable amount of time  &mdash;  so maybe the forthcoming federal hate crimes legislation will finally put them in jail and keep them there.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;areas of the brain shows hate creates a unique pattern of brain activates which includes some overlap with brain areas activated by love.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It seems this measures the intensity of passion, both hate and love.</p>
<p>One question is how do you establish a baseline? Test everyone? You would have to know a great deal of every individual for the results to have real evidentiary value.</p>
<p>Another is, when black commit a crime in which whites are the victim, would they be required to be tested for hate? If so, blacks would be the first ones condemning this as racist.</p>

			<p>You know which group this will be directed at, don&rsquo;t you? Whites only. People that frequent this site, patriots, so-called &#8220;white supremacists&#8221;, racists, etc. But they will all be Whites only. Say your kid gets attacked by blacks, hispanics and you complain or file a report. Do you not believe this will be an excuse for them to test you and your kid for the &#8220;hate&#8221; gene? </p>

			<p>Firstly taking away positive and negative connotations for love and hate. Odviousily love is more pleasurable than hate.<br>
But as we know doing what is pleasurable is not always best in the long term.</p>
<p>But one apparently can not live without the other (love/hate).<br>
From this article I read into it that hate is good and necessary for survival.<br>
And loving &#8216;everyone or anyone&rsquo;(my words) makes you less critical, judgmental and shuts down your ability to reason. <br>
So hate is a basic protective instinct, and loving makes you vunerable. <br>
So to protect the ones you love, you must hate!<br>
It is like a analogy for Left Vs Right politics.<br>

			<p>Now at least we know why all those liberals who love the illegal immigrant, the lawbreaker, gay marriage and all the other ills that beset society act the way they do. The reasoning part of their brain is shut down. This is fantastic research.</p>

Things have really progressed in the science of witch hunting.   In the old days a suspect would be tied up and tossed into the river.  If she drowned she was innocent, if she floated she was a witch and burned at the stake.</p>
<p>Now the suspects, American Renaissance readers, can have electrodes attached to them; shown pictures of MLK, Obama, Abe Foxman, and a couple of sodomites.  If they registers as haters they will be given a pill and cremated.  We&rsquo;ve come a long way.<br>

			<p>A little off topic but the word &#8220;hate&#8221; has about as much punch as the word &#8220;racist&#8221; these days.  These words have been so watered down by the MSM and white liberals that they have lost all significant meaning.  Any white person who is proud of his heritage and wishes to preserve his culture is deemed to be a &#8220;racist&#8221; and publications such as AmRen are described as &#8220;hateful&#8221;.  <br>
Meanwhile the NAACP and La Raza are consistently labeled as &#8220;civil rights&#8221; organizations&hellip;         </p>

			<p>Thinking about &#8216;hate&rsquo; a little further&hellip;.<br>
If you said to the average person <br>
&#8220;I really, really hate Hitler in fact I am overflowing with hate towards him, because he was such a bad man&#8221;. <br>
(Exaggeration aside) they would assume you a &#8216;good person&rsquo;, because you are &#8216;full of hate&rsquo; towards a &#8216;bad person&rsquo;, but neithertheless you are still a hateful person.<br>
Hate has such negative connotations about it, sure stress is a killer but maybe &#8216;hate saves&rsquo;.<br>
Look at all the Obama &#8216;love fest&rsquo;(less critical, judgmental and shuts down your ability to reason) and how hateful (frothing at the mouth) they were towards the GOP supporters, and how that fired them up to fight the &#8216;common foe&rsquo;. And you could imagine what the far-left supporters would like to do to us for thinking the way we do, I get feeling that extreme violence could be justified against us &#8216;because WE are so hateful&rsquo;(perceived at least, because we also talk about how love for our families etc motivates us).<br>
We &#8216;hate their love&rsquo;, and &#8216;love our hate&rsquo;.<br>
And they &#8216;hate our love&rsquo; and &#8216;love their hate&rsquo;, ah the duality of man.<br>
Instead of trying to eliminate hate, maybe we should just accept it is part of us, be it a inherent &#8216;base instinct&rsquo; like the need for food, shelter and warmth. And if fact it is good because it has allowed us to survive, to allow us the luxury of being here now talking as we are.<br>
Leaving guilt aside, are whites more hateful because of our capabilites perhaps? Or from survivng the harsh Northern European winters, and the same could be said for Africans surviving their terrain.<br>
I think both sides of politics have unrealistic utopian vision(s), that if we could &#8216;change&rsquo; the world into our vision of the way it should be (i.e brainwash all the white kids to &#8216;self hate&rsquo; to promote a multicultural world), then we will have a world free of hate( a world less critical, judgmental and shuts down your ability to reason). <br>
Which of course I am asserting is impossible because hate is a basic part of us, maybe that is why &#8216;self hate&rsquo; directed at whites is so effective.<br>
And in a world of &#8216;haves and have nots&rsquo; I personally think a world free of hate could never exist. Because, hey at the end of the day we are not all equal. And saying so is dangerous.</p>

			<p>Perhaps this technology can be used to limit voting to those deserving of that right.  Instead of property qualifications or literacy tests, the prospective voter would be shown photos of O.J.and Nichole Simpson or demonstrators waving Mexican flags and the like, and the brain scan would note if the reasoning areas of the brain lit up.  Who could object to restricing the vote to those who can reason?  </p>

			<p>This is pure rubbish, unscientific, popularized pseudoscience, or whatever one wishes to call it.  One thing it is not, at least on the basis of the selection presented here is science.  The neural pathways of the human brain are very complex and those associated with various emotions frequently overlap.  No one has produced a scan of neuronal activity corresponding to &#8220;hate&#8221; although it is easy enough to see increased activity under the surrogate marker of increased cerebral blood flow associated with emotions.  Such is nothing new and the notion that one can simply scan a subject and determine whether or not he hates &#8220;x&#8221; by showing him a picture of x and watching some imagined cerebral monitoring gadget is pure science fiction.  Even if it were true and one could do exactly what is suggested (which one can&rsquo;t currently), it would not be of significance in a court of law.  Imagine the prosecutor presenting the brain scan showing that the accused &#8220;hated&#8221; the victim.  While it might provide a motive, motive is only one of the elements needed to prove guilt.  Until the very recent advent of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;, it was the action that was necessary for a crime to be committed, irrespective of any mental attitude except &#8220;intent&#8221;.  Perhaps in our future courts under Obama we will be able to be charged, tried and punished for our thoughts alone.  This has not yet occurred, but then it is still very, very early in the yet to be Obama administration.<br>
One unrelated note; just how great a lack of intelligence is required for a white person to drive around a mostly white town with an Obama sticker on his/her car bumper?  Don&rsquo;t these paragons of virtue and enlightnment realize that such in your face demonstrations of loyalty to Obama instantly make enemies of over half of the white population (both a majority of white men and women voted against Obama in the election).  Whenever I see such a bumper sticker I am immediately overcome by &#8220;hate&#8221;, something that should become clear on the new &#8220;hate-ometer&#8221; discussed here.</p>
