				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), November 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The wife of Paul Boateng is being investigated for the alleged bullying of her domestic staff in South Africa.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office in London is monitoring the scandal that threatens to engulf Janet Boateng, married to Britain&rsquo;s first black High Commissioner.</p>
<p>Mrs Boateng, a former social-services administrator, oversees the running of the couple&rsquo;s two official residences: the High Commissioner&rsquo;s nine-bedroom thatched mansion in Cape Town and the luxury eight-bedroom residence in Pretoria.</p>
<p>Now she is facing accusations against her by black domestic staff of verbal bullying.</p>
<p>&#8220;While a grievance has been raised by some members of the residence staff, it has not been made against Mr Boateng,&#8221; a Foreign Office spokesman was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The spokesman would not give details of the alleged bullying.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an internal personnel matter being investigated in South Africa at the appropriate level with assistance from our legal adviser on local labour law issues and the Foreign Office in London.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ministers are aware of the situation, no disciplinary action has been taken and the term of Mr Boateng&rsquo;s posting has not been altered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Boateng was a incendiary left-wing lawyer who made history in 2002 by becoming Britain&rsquo;s first black Cabinet minister.</p>
<p>The 57-year-old was given the posting in South Africa by Tony Blair when he stepped down at the 2005 general election.</p>

			<p>After 40 years of working with black women, in several jobs, I can say that nearly all of them are bullies.  Black women have an enormous drive towards domination.  They are much, much worse bullies than black men.</p>
<p>I have seen the lowest level black female project dwelling clerks bullying Judges and even a Nobel prize nominated physician who was a pioneer in cardiac medicine.</p>
<p>Not all black men are bullies, but almost all black women are.</p>
<p>No wonder their men want only one thing from them and flee the black women as soon as they get it.</p>

<p>Well of course, she is Ms.Big, as such she can do what she pleases. I&rsquo;m not saying that Whites never let a little power and position go to their heads because sometimes they do, but Blacks are notorious abusers of power.</p>

The &#8220;Black&#8221; can be servile, submissive, obliging, (and according to the romantic literature), as faithful and as loyal as one&rsquo;s dog.  </p>
<p>Once he gets the upper-hand, though, he is the most arrogant, insolent, demanding and demeaning of all the creatures made by God that walk about on two legs. Those traits are especially noticeable among the female of the kind, but it is not limited thereto. </p>

			<p>The more I hear about Italy, the more I like them.  They have one of the few Western governments that is talking any sense.  Maybe the original home of the Renaissance will be the home of the new Renaissance.</p>

<p>I too find this to be true. I&rsquo;m not saying all Black women are like this but about 70% are, at least in my experience. Black men aren&rsquo;t nearly as bad. As someone else said, no wonder many Black men pick partners outside their race, though Black men are nothing to brag about.</p>

			<p>The writer of 7:05 PM is correct.<br>
For those who have never witnessed it, the mutual hatred/contempt so often displayed by black men and women for each other is mirrored (very lightly) in the lyrics of many jazz, rhythm and blues and reggae songs, not to mention that horrible form of expession called &#8216;rap&rsquo;.The lyrics of some of the &#8216;nastier&rsquo; songs (which often contain very insulting and purposely degrading sexual and gynaecological jibes,)give the unacquainted genteel observer a general taste of the caliber of the black mind and &#8216;what goes on behind closed doors&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>A survey of domestic nannies here in the USA was done within the last couple of years, and found that the majority of black nannies preferred not to work for black couples because of this very reason  &mdash;  the black nannies felt that once black women got some money or &#8216;position&rsquo;, they were generally abusive and cruel toward other blacks beneath them  &mdash;  and because white lived in much safer neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Yes, the survey found even black people preferred to work for white people, who treated them with more respect and dignity than their own kind.  Life in Africa for blacks proves this everyday.</p>

			<p>Just imagine how the staff in the now, &#8220;off-white&#8221; house are going to be treated by their new ruler. It will be an obamanation.</p>

			<p>Before long this tribal leader will be kickin&rsquo; it old skool. Selling some of her &#8220;domestics&#8221; off like the black slavers have always done when they receive a modicum of power. </p>

<p>Women in general are bigger bullies than men, black and white&hellip;they are vicious and vindictive thank that to the feminist and women&rsquo;s rights movement&hellip;and I am sorry to say that men have allowed this non-sense to spread like wildfire.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with this at all. I don&rsquo;t think women are more vindictive then men and this has not been my personal experience. How vindictive one is depends on the individual&rsquo;s personality. Men commit far more acts of violence due to revenge then women and the women&rsquo;s rights movement has nothing to do with how vindictive a woman is, her personality determines that. I do agree that many Black women are very aggressive though, this through a lot of personal experience.</p>

<p>We agree to disagree but as a woman I can tell based on my personal experience with them&hellip;..the treatment of Sarah Palin by women speaks volume!</p>
<p>The difference is that violent crimes committed by men is over reported while the violence committed by women is no crime at all&hellip;.their crimes aka mental torture is invisible to the eye while men mostly commit violence that is psychical visible for everyone to and seen as crimes under the law.</p>
