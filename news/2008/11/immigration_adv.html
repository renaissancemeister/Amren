<h1>Immigration Advocates Cautiously Look for Reform</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deborah Barfield Berry, Gannet News Service, November 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With more Democrats in Congress next year and a Democrat in the White House, immigration rights groups are gearing up to again urge lawmakers to overhaul the nation&rsquo;s immigration laws.</p>
<p>But they concede their agenda could be pushed back while the new administration and Congress wrestle with other pressing problems: the struggling economy, the health care crisis and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration advocates say their case is bolstered by the huge Latino support of Democrats, particularly President-elect Barack Obama. Advocates say many immigrant voters supported Obama because he promised reform.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Efforts to change federal immigration policies have sparked bitter partisan battles in Congress. For years, comprehensive immigration reform measures have failed and scaled-back plans have stalled. Most action on immigration policies has happened on the local level.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Congressional leaders should &#8220;use the power of the new majority to really deliver on this issue,&#8221; said Hong [Chung-Wha Hong, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition]. &#8220;What we&rsquo;re opposed to is avoiding the issue and letting the issue fester when there are clear solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even with increased Democratic majorities in the Congress and a Democrat in the White House, immigration reform advocates are cautious about being overconfident.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not a slam dunk,&#8221; said Jeanne Butterfield, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, adding that bills will need bipartisan support. &#8220;In the Senate, you still don&rsquo;t have every Democrat on board.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada plans to take up immigration reform but is still working with the new administration on timing, said Jon Summers, a Reid spokesman. House leaders also have promised to consider measures.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Donald Kerwin of the Migration Policy Institute said that with such differing views, Congress is not likely to act on immigration early in the session.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said if lawmakers don&rsquo;t consider the issue early, it could &#8220;slide into midterms&#8221; &mdash; the 2010 election &mdash; and again become a contentious campaign issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Democrats &#8220;now have a clear shot at governing,&#8221; said Cecilia Munoz of the National Council of La Raza. &#8220;If the immigration question is still festering two or four years from now, people are going to (doubt) what they can deliver.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Democrats will have to do more than not sound like Republicans.&#8221;<br>

<p>When they supported Obama, were they bright enough to understand that there&rsquo;s very little the Obamanation can do for them if there are few jobs here, which are dwindling every day, in addition to the fact the more jobs Hispanics have the fewer are available for blacks?</p>
<p>If these leftist fools passed the amnesty package right now, thinking they would get a substantial boost in revenue, they&rsquo;re going to find out the extra burden on social services is going to cause the economy to plummet even faster toward dangerous levels, but what that kindly old grandmother Harry Reid and the feminist-oriented Nancy Pelosi decide to do is anybody&rsquo;s guess.  </p>
<p>If they have anything in common it&rsquo;s their ability to screw things up beyond repair, then blame some dense Republican who doesn&rsquo;t have the verbal ability to defend himself, so he idiotically takes the blame by offering no passionate denouncement.</p>
<p>The consensus among the REAL experts is that no matter what Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;experts&#8221; do, the economy is going to bottom out this coming Spring, and another domino effect will be playing out and it will continue on throughout the world.</p>
<p>Is anybody stockpiling canned goods?  </p>

<p>What is most striking here, is how simplistic and near illiterate that paragraph is. It is something one might expect from an uninspired second grader; way to go, Comrade Berry. It seems to hold that &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are any creature that simply finds itself on US soil, be it a &#8220;Latino&#8221; or a mosquito. No real thought process is evident, other than the most basic of nonconceptual and disorganized word clustering, that is both insulting to the reader and should be so humiliating to the &#8220;journalist,&#8221; that she should resign her position and seek work as a domestic servant in charge of toilet &#8220;management.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Of course, what else is new?</p>
<p>as always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to do:</p>
<p>Option A: fight this, hard, by getting in the face of friends, relatives, and law makers. </p>
<p>Option B: hunker down, get out of sight, stock up on food and other supplies and disappear. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sending regular letters to my lawmakers on the need to cool it on immigration. I&rsquo;m beginning to think maybe it&rsquo;s too late and I should get my head down.<br>

			<p>Have you ever noticed that it is always called &#8220;Comprehensive Immigration Reform&#8221;, &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; or just &#8220;reform&#8221;, and never what it is, amnesty! This is another way they lie to us. Illegal criminal invaders automagically become &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, the same as a Swede with a PhD who waited in line for 10 years and spent $1000&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Passing mass amnesty for 11 million invader criminals now, with chain immigration of 30-40 million more guaranteed afterward, in the middle of a nightmarishly bad economy would write the book on stupid. But never say anything is so dumb that a Democrat would not do it.</p>

			<p>This is not the time to retreat&hellip; after the success we had at derailing immigration &#8220;reform&#8221; (amnesty), we still have the momentum on this issue, and Washington (even Obama) knows it.</p>
<p>Now is the time to press ahead, loudly and in large numbers, and build on our momentum and advantage while the opposition is stunned, derailing amnesty for the final, and likely last, time.</p>
<p>Advance when you have the momentum.</p>
<p>Reatreat or dig in when the momentum is against you.</p>
<p>Right now we have the momentum, so we advance.</p>
<p>The enemy has dug in, because they know we have it.</p>
<p>Another victory (which will be easier now that the momentum is on our side) will cause the enemy to retreat.</p>
<p>After that, there will be only nominal efforts at amnesty, which will be easily defeated.</p>

			<p>Instead of &#8220;Immigration Rights&#8221; how about &#8220;Immigration Responsibility&#8221;?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; code words for open borders?</p>

			<p>I voted for Rep. Senator Saxby Chambliss again in the re-vote(We&rsquo;ll know the results Dec. 2). If Dem. Senator Jim Martin wins the 60th seat in the Senate, the Republicans will not be able to filibuster.(I believe this is right.) The Republicans will be out completely. I&rsquo;m no die-hard Republican, but I&rsquo;m doing what I can to try to hold off the liberal onslaught. </p>
<p>Georgia did her part. </p>

			<p>Why is it that the Latinos are the one and only group that openly wants us to ignore the law and let all these people in the country illegally. This makes my blood boil like nothing else. Millions of people break the law by coming here uninvited, then break many more laws such as driving without a license,not paying income tax, etc. and they want amnesty? How about if they start with some respect for this country. How about if they think about all the people that wait patiently, and work hard to have themselves and their loved ones come into this country the right way. I have no sympathy for these people, and if they had any courage and honor they would stay in their homeland and strive to make that a better place.</p>

<p>It hardly matters.  No matter what happened in the election, these &#8220;immigration advocates&#8221; would have spun it so as to support their cause.  If anything, McCain was the more vocal supporter of amnesty, and had a formidable legislative background to boot (McCain-Kennedy, anyone?), so the given explanation makes no sense.</p>

 Jeez, there were 12 million illegals 7 years ago. There has to be at least 30 million now, probably more than that.</p>

<p>Yes.  Not only canned goods but water, water filters, dog food, ammunition, and other amenities so we can hunker down if need be for a few months.</p>
<p>DH thought I was an alarmist nut at first  &mdash;  no longer, after the election of obama and the deflation of his 401. NOW he&rsquo;s interested in purchasing gold (before it becomes illegal, that is).</p>
<p>I foresee riots in the future what with rising unemployment AND inflation. As I live outside of LA  &mdash;  capital of the third world  &mdash;  it could get ugly as the illegal immigrant gangs here, welcomed by sanctuary city policies, are fully armed, mobile, and filled with hate and rage.</p>
<p>Will the government come to my rescue?  HA!</p>
<p>Better to prepare myself and my loved ones.</p>

			<p>Agree with John and Sandstorm.   It is always amazing to me how the immigrant communities, with very limited English, dictate to US what they think needs to be done for their immigration needs. There is no discussion about the law, national security, or economic entitlement sustainability.  They do not care for USA; just their own selfish invasive interests.   No conscious,no shame.  Limited language abilities limit thoughts and conscious and concern for US.  <br>
US does not need reforms (amnesty) it only needs to enforce immigration laws neglected(suppressed) for over 50 years from inside the beltway.  Now, it appears Latinos are running DC and BamBam is appointing Latino in charge of Immigration Agency! Wrong direction for a President-elect about to take oath to protect and defend US.   Words are just words; action is all.  V</p>

			<p>We are witnessing the bully syndrome.  When a schoolyard bully picks on someone who won&rsquo;t fight back the lesser bullies will take their turn picking on the coward who won&rsquo;t fight back until it trickles down to bullies half the size and age of the spineless victim.  </p>
<p>Because America&rsquo;s emasculated men of the majority aren&rsquo;t fighting for what is ours this emboldens the domestic bottom feeders and the aliens of the third world to push us around.  <br>
