<h1><a href="https://www.news8.net/news/stories/1108/568957.html">McCain Supporter Claims She Suffered Racial Taunts in Class</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WJLA-TV (Washington, D.C.), November 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gloria Alfonzo [of Prince George&rsquo;s Community College] says she endured racial taunts and slurs because she supported John McCain&rsquo;s presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Her problems, she said, began with an assignment to write about the merits of Barack Obama. When she announced she differed with Obama, Alfonzo says her African-American classmates subjected her to an onslaught of racial hatred.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alfonzo said all of her classmates &mdash; except for herself and one other &mdash; were black, as was the instructor, Ayanna Watson. She says the teacher demanded to know whether she is a Republican.</p>
<p>Alfonzo maintains her answer drove her fellow students into a racially-charged rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;They got up from their chairs they started pointing at me and, um, saying, &lsquo;You are a daughter of a,&rsquo; you know, &lsquo;[expletive deleted]&rsquo; and &lsquo;[expletive deleted] white girl,&rsquo;&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Chris Monroe was in the same class.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never seen so much hate for one person,&#8221; he recalled.</p>
<p>Monroe agrees with Alfonzo that the teacher never came to her defense. He found the vicious taunts deeply troubling.</p>
<p>He recalled some of the things he remembers them saying:  &#8220;[Expletive deleted} white whore,&rsquo; all that. &lsquo;Traitor [expletive deleted], all kinds of stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ABC 7/NewsChannel 8 reporter Stephen Tschida stopped by the teacher&rsquo;s home. There was no answer at the door, but her politics were proudly displayed: a large Obama sign on her front door.</p>
<p>After the incident, Alfonzo went to her college adviser, who agreed she should withdraw.</p>

											<p>
							<i>John Kass, Chicago Tribune, November 13, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Catherine Vogt, 14, is an Illinois 8th grader, the daughter of a liberal mom and a conservative dad. She wanted to conduct an experiment in political tolerance and diversity of opinion at her school in the liberal suburb of Oak Park.</p>
<p>She noticed that fellow students at Gwendolyn Brooks Middle School overwhelmingly supported Barack Obama for president. His campaign kept preaching &#8220;inclusion,&#8221; and she decided to see how included she could be.</p>
<p>So just before the election, Catherine consulted with her history teacher, then bravely wore a unique T-shirt to school and recorded the comments of teachers and students in her journal. The T-shirt bore the simple yet quite subversive words drawn with a red marker:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just really curious how they&rsquo;d react to something that different, because a lot of people at my school wore Obama shirts and they are big Obama supporters,&#8221; Catherine told us. &#8220;I just really wanted to see what their reaction would be.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People were upset. But they started saying things, calling me very stupid, telling me my shirt was stupid and I shouldn&rsquo;t be wearing it,&#8221; Catherine said.</p>
<p>Then it got worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;One person told me to go die. It was a lot of dying. A lot of comments about how I should be killed,&#8221; Catherine said, of the tolerance in Oak Park.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In one class, I had one teacher say she will not judge me for my choice, but that she was surprised that I supported McCain,&#8221; Catherine said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One student suggested that she be put up on a cross for her political beliefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said, &lsquo;You should be crucifixed.&rsquo; It was kind of funny because, I was like, don&rsquo;t you mean &lsquo;crucified?&rsquo; &#8221; Catherine said.</p>
<p>Other entries in her notebook involved suggestions by classmates that she be &#8220;burned with her shirt on&#8221; for &#8220;being a filthy-rich Republican.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some said that because she supported McCain, by extension she supported a plan by deranged skinheads to kill Obama before the election. And I thought such politicized logic was confined to American newsrooms. Yet Catherine refused to argue with her peers. She didn&rsquo;t want to jeopardize her experiment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only a few times did anyone say anything remotely positive about her McCain shirt. One girl pulled her aside in a corner, out of earshot of other students, and whispered, &#8220;I really like your shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you know America is truly supportive of diversity of opinion, when children must whisper for fear of being ostracized, heckled and crucifixed.</p>
<p>The next day, in part 2 of The Brave Catherine Vogt Experiment, she wore another T-shirt, this one with &#8220;Obama Girl&#8221; written in blue. And an amazing thing happened.</p>
<p>Catherine wasn&rsquo;t very stupid anymore. She grew brains.</p>
<p>&#8220;People liked my shirt. They said things like my brain had come back, and I had put the right shirt on today,&#8221; Catherine said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But she sure did, and she turned her journal into a report for her history teacher, earning Catherine extra credit. We asked the teacher, Norma Cassin-Pountney, whether it was ironic that Catherine would be subject to such intolerance from pro-Obama supporters in a community that prides itself on its liberal outlook.</p>

 Please refer to my post of yesterday and repeat after me&hellip;<br>
&#8220;My mother fled a communist country*. She taught me that protecting the secret of the ballot box is more important than who you vote for and even who wins in the end.&#8221;<br>
* Of course with this group the admission of fleeing a communist country would enrage them also.</p>

			<p>Black folks better get used to it.  They are just now starting to get a taste of their own medicine and I don&rsquo;t think they like it very much.  Obama is going to get criticized a lot during his Presidency as would any President.  The fact that he is idolized by blacks does not mean that everybody will love him.  When he screws up he will get no mercy especially from the people he has been critical of his whole adult life.  I think criticism will get worse what whites find their voices and start to feel that the era of white guilt is already over.  Jubilation!    </p>

			<p>     Older people can be just as ignorant and hostile. I voted in my first presidential election in the &#8216;50&rsquo;s. I put an &rsquo; I like Ike &rsquo; sign on my front lawn. My next door neighbors informed me that it was a mortal sin to vote for a Republican and I was going to Hell. I lived there for another ten years and not once did they ever speak to me again. People back then were just as stupid as people are today.</p>

			<p> It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine what would have happened if an almost-all-White class with a White teacher had behaved that way toward a black student who announced his/her support for Obama! Protests, denunciations in the school newspaper, a coast-to-coast news story with much head shaking and breast beating about &#8220;racial hatred is alive and well,&#8221; ad nauseum. But because it was a White victim, and black hatred, little will be heard beyond the confines of the American Renaissance website. And that, fellow AmReners, is what&rsquo;s REALLY sad.</p>

			<p>Speaking about political T-Shirts, I&rsquo;ve read where in some high schools black kids are wearing shirts that say &#8220;My President is Black&#8221; on them. One could retaliate by wearing one that says &#8220;My President is Half-White&#8221;! No way anyone could deny it, even a liberal. Let&rsquo;s see what the liberal &#8220;tolerant&#8221; reaction would be to that.</p>

			<p>All enlightened people know that &#8220;tolerance&#8221; is nothing more than a euphamism for the forced acceptance of alien, unpalatable or even perverted ideas and behaviors. The self-appointed Ayatollas of &#8220;tolerance&#8221; are not interested in tolerance at all. They are interested only in others accepting their opinions&hellip;and only their opinions on controversial matters. Just look at the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; movement. A more profoundly and violently intolerant group cannot be imagined!</p>

			<p>&#8220;I (the teacher, after she found out about the experiment) said, here you are, promoting this person [Obama] that believes we are all equal and included, and look what you&rsquo;ve done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure, Obama fever is all about equality and inclusion. And pigs fly every day.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I could see this Chicago girl earning an invitation to the White House from Obama. This is probably the most accurate bit of social science to appear in the Chicago Tribune in decades.  </p>

			<p>I had a diversity teacher once say, &#8220;diversity means tolerance, period&#8221;. Clearly though it only means tolerance for blacks. It means something else entirely toward whites. Perhaps the &#8216;liberal view&rsquo; is understandable however. There&rsquo;s a whole fantasy world constructed where intimidate and hate crimes are something whites, perpetrate against blacks, and where our public facilities are &#8216;institutionally racist&rsquo;. Against blacks too. Thinking that way, it could be said the liberal views isn&rsquo;t all that surprising. It could certainly be advocated that these folks are simply are unaware of what&rsquo;s really going on.  </p>

			<p>I cannot believe a teacher would allow an incident like that to happen in college, now if this were to occur in an inner city public school I would not be nearly as surprised.<br>
I think the key to handling these types of situations is being able to defend your positions in a calm, intelligent and articulate manner. However, I understand that in some &lsquo;cultures&rsquo; arguments are won not through rational debate, but through wielding a machete. (Or mindless yelling.)</p>
<p>I have already had to defend my positions several times against the Obama hoards. I have found that simply asking them why they support Obama, followed by (if necessary) methodically dismantling their response is usually sufficient and quite easy. You will find that a majority of the time simply asking them why they support Obama is more than enough to destroy their credibility. <br>
Typical responses include: change, he&rsquo;s black and that&rsquo;s different, he&rsquo;ll fix the economy, and no more war. All of which are either completely mindless, empty rhetoric, lies (i.e. war) or are easy discredited by merely asking &#8216;how&rsquo;?</p>
<p>I will disclose that I am a fervent Ron Paul supporter.<br>

			<p>Smart girl! Brave girl too. And if she could handle it with grace and humor, all the more credit to her.</p>
<p>As for those budding teenage hypocrites, they don&rsquo;t deserve comment. Some of the teachers were still worse.  But I would be curious to know the racial identification of each of them. Too bad it wasn&rsquo;t specified. Oh, that&rsquo;s media taboo, I know. But it would have added  further dimension to this story. </p>
<p>When I went to school, being called a communist was about the worst thing that you could be. Now, it seems to be the reverse.</p>

			<p>This was all over America in all 50 states. College professors harrassed students who called themselves publically conservatives and even wanted them out of their classes. There are many undocumented cases by the millions like this but then again its ok because we know its all a part of the great payback reparation black hole bottomless pit. </p>
<p>On a side note we want to know what Obamas stance was on white double murderer OJ Simpson when the verdict came down in 1995? Did he cheer with the blacks? Noone ever asked him. </p>

			<p>I fled &#8220;affluent&#8221; Prince George&rsquo;s County years ago.  Much of Maryland is made up of people that are part of the great diaspora from PG County.  Every year the Washington Post writes about black anguish over the lack of good shopping and restaurants in &#8220;affluent&#8221; PG County without reflecting on the types of people who make the majority there.  PG County, home of bad schools, the highest suburban violent crime rates in the country and 89 % Obama support.  Why this poor girl attends a community college that has a reputation not above beautician school is beyond me.</p>

<p>Ah, yes. An assignment to sing the praises of our great leader. </p>
<p>One need look no further for evidence that the educational system in this country has been totally infiltrated by communists.</p>

			<p>This is a good illustration of why &#8220;democrazy&#8221; simply doesn&rsquo;t work in black settings - whether countries or classrooms.  Anyone who has worked with them or lived around them will know that.  For blacks, there is only one way   &mdash;   THEIR way.</p>
<p>Not every system works for every group. Different races are simply different. Democracy was invented by whites and for whites.</p>
