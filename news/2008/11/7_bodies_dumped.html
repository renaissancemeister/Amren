<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27911854/">7 Bodies Dumped at Mexican School Field</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, November 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico &mdash; The seven bodies were dumped before dawn Tuesday at a school soccer field in a leafy, upscale neighborhood in this Mexican border city.</p>
<p>Neighbors found the bodies &mdash; beaten, choked, in some cases mutilated and then shot &mdash; lined up along the field&rsquo;s fence. Alongside were three banners allegedly signed by a Mexican drug gang with messages directed at a rival gang, police spokesman Jaime Torres said.</p>
<p>Hours after the bodies were removed, blood stained the curb, yellow police tape hung from the fence and classes continued at Colegio Sierra Madre, a private kindergarten-through-high school in a neighborhood of stucco homes, manicured lawns and palm trees.</p>
<p>Only police in ski masks periodically drove past the campus, which posted an armed guard at the metal gate.</p>
<p><b>No suspects yet</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The homicides were the latest of hundreds of gruesome killings in Ciudad Juarez, where drug violence has taken a particularly heavy toll during Mexico&rsquo;s nationwide crackdown on the drug cartels that supply U.S. consumers.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
These murders were among more than 4,000 drug-related killings this year in Mexico. Challenged by arrests, deaths, extraditions and new rivals, the cartels are brazenly attacking each other as well as police and the 20,000 soldiers President Felipe Calderon deployed against the drug gangs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities acknowledge that the vast majority of kidnappings and other crimes go unreported in Mexico because people mistrust police. The government is also reluctant to release homicide figures regularly, making it difficult to grasp the true breadth of kidnappings, homicides and robberies in Mexico.<br>

			<p>All I can say is &#8216;get in line&rsquo; on the list of important issues plaguing the U.S. and the world. I hate to hear of killings. I hate that the U.S. is looked to for everything. But, we&rsquo;ve done that to ourselves.   </p>
<p>The U.S. needs tougher security and people in authority that give a damn.(But, I guess that&rsquo;s not part of the world&rsquo;s master plan.)So what can be said or done by someone or most people in my position?</p>

<p>Forgive me for being trite, but yeah, this is Mexico we are talking about. In fact, this is practically the same Mexico as it always was since it became Mexico, with some modern technology added. Intelligent people will draw the appropriated conclusions, others will vacation there. Just my opinion.</p>

			<p>How long will it be before the mexican government stops pretending, suspends all due process rights and wages a full scale war of extermination against the drug cartels&hellip;.soldier, not police&hellip;.no attempt to separate the guilty from the innocent.</p>
<p>Eventually, they&rsquo;ll do this.  They have to.  The gangs have become too powerful to deal with as a police issue.  Eventually, they will overthrow the government.  Will the elites in mexico allow that to happen?  I doubt it.</p>

			<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the world speak up about this violent nation? I would like to see all aid, financing, trade deals or anything to do with Mexico eliminated. The world court should speak out like they do about any other terrorist nation. Instead, our politicians welcome these people to our country. Do they really think that people who breech our borders, steal identies and jobs, drive drunk killing innocent people, murder, rape, molest, etc. sre suddenly going to become honest, upright citizens when the magic wand of citizenship is waved over them? How utterly insane.</p>

			<p>As I have said before.  Boycott all things Mexican, especialy tourism.  Read the State Dept. warning on travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>With remittances, exports and tourism taking a hit, maybe the Mexican government will get the message that we are fed-up with their antics.</p>

			<p>Only 7!! where did they put the others? I still say that the solution to this kind of conduct is to take the gloves and straitjackets off of our special ops military units. We know who the initiators of this kind of conduct down there (and up here) is, just allow covert ops and be done with this nonsense.</p>

			<p>As with most 3rd World countries, the Drug Cartels are in hock with the Military, Police, and Government.</p>
<p>This alone should be enough for the USA to build a massive fence on its Southern border.</p>
<p>You can kind of appreciate why half of Mexico has gone to America.</p>
<p>If things ever stabalize there, I imagine many may go back.</p>
<p>You would think being next door to America would allow Mexico to make huge amounts of money from cross-border trade.  The legal stuff, that is.</p>

			<p>MEXICANS hide full extent of Mexican crime! Sounds a lot like the United States, especially when it comes to the CRIMINALS RACE. Time after time the &#8220;same link&#8221; is there, RACE is a factor that they never mention. Look at the News Anchor brutally murdered in Arkansas (And who really knows what else he did to the poor girl) The MURDERER as USUAL ((( BLACK ))). Am I the only one who see&rsquo;s this? (Of Course I&rsquo;m Not)</p>

			<p>The Mexican federales blame Mexican crime on the &#8220;availability&#8221; of American guns. They contend that Mexican criminals obtain guns from American gun shops and shows.</p>
<p>If that were indeed the case, then shouldn&rsquo;t it cry out for that wall to be erected between the USA and Mexico? If the wall were built, then the Mexican criminal cartels couldn&rsquo;t cross over into the USA, and buy those weapons. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Nah. That would be too easy. The Mexican federales prefer to blame their crime problem on American firearms. In the meantime, their efforts to catch the Mexican druglords remind me of the futile, neverending efforts of Wiley Coyote to catch the Roadrunner.</p>
