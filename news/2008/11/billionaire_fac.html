<h1>Billionaire Facebook Investor&rsquo;s Anti-Immigrant Heresy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Owen Thomas, Valley Wag, November 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Insiders at Clarium Capital, the $5.3 billion hedge fund run by Facebook investor Peter Thiel, are buzzing about their boss&rsquo;s $1 million donation to NumbersUSA, an anti-immigrant group. The donation is an open secret within Clarium, and it has enraged several staff members who joined Clarium because they believed Thiel shared their libertarian ideals. When I asked Thiel if he&rsquo;d made the donation, an underling passed on a nondenial saying the company didn&rsquo;t comment on &#8220;gossip and heresy.&#8221; A typo &mdash; he meant to say &#8220;hearsay&#8221; &mdash; but a suggestive one. Thiel has fallen under the sway of Robertson &#8220;Rob&#8221; Morrow III, a Christian right-wing thinker who has personally donated to NumbersUSA, and persuaded Thiel to make his own, much larger donation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A NumbersUSA spokesman called me to deny that Thiel had made a donation. But the money trail out of Clarium is clear, insiders say, and it would be a simple matter for Thiel to have arranged to make his donation through a third party like DonorsTrust, a conservative foundation through which charitable grants can be directed. The reason why Thiel would want his donation to be anonymous is simple: Even while he&rsquo;s betting against immigration with his hedge fund, he&rsquo;s making money off of immigrant-run startups in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>However Thiel is getting the money to NumbersUSA, it has specific goals: upgrading NumbersUSA&rsquo;s computer system; hiring a full-time fundraiser to solicit large donations from the wealthy; and hiring Luntz Maslansky Strategic Research to run focus groups on public attitudes toward immigration.</p>
<p>So Thiel, like many wealthy sorts, is getting into politics. {snip}</p>
<p>That he&rsquo;s now fallen under the sway of a right-wing Christian conservative is a bit crushing to the true believers Thiel attracted to his cause. Thiel once aimed to overturn the system. Now he just wants to work within it. As much as his anti-immigration views render him noxious to the Northern California mainstream, his turning away from an embrace of freedom make him an enemy to the rebellious thinkers he&rsquo;s hired.<br>

		<p>Looks like freedom is still slavery in the MSM&rsquo;s lexicon. Maybe Mr. Thomas should canvass the MySpace community before deciding rebellion only goes in one direction. He might be shocked at how realistic the upcoming generation is about race, ethnicity, and immigration. I have certainly found this the case vis-a-vis my late boomer contemporaries.</p>

		<p>Should Thiel review the contributions and viewpoints of the people he hires and decide whether he approves or disapproves of their exercise of free speech rights? Why not? Isn&rsquo;t that what they are doing to their employer?</p>
<p>Freedom is not limited to those we approve of, or agree with. This aspect of freedom will be sorely tested in the next few years. I will always come down on the side of freedom against those who insist on doing the thinking for everyone else.<br>

<p>Yes, but don&rsquo;t forget to donate as well. </p>
<p>My liberal family members unfailingly donate to the ACLU, ADL, JDL and the Democratic Party  &mdash;  they believe &#8216;money talks&rsquo; and rightly so.</p>
<p>Many of &#8216;our&rsquo; organizations operate on shoe-string budgets, unlike our opposition which receive millions of dollars  &mdash;  millions that they willingly use to file lawsuits against us, with the explicit goals of silencing us and putting us out of business permanently. </p>
<p>Many of these organizations have the big guns of the government behind them as well.</p>
<p>Roy Beck states that we are outspent by a factor of 10 to one.</p>
<p>Please consider donating to NumbersUSA, AmRen, VDARE and other organizations that battle mightily against fierce, growing, Marxist opposition. </p>

<p>What Thiel must realize, as any smart libertarian should, is that there is no low tax, low regulation regime in our future if whites become a minority. Every indicator shows the US moving to a big government authoritarian welfare state.</p>

<p>Is this the same system that regularly nominates immigration enthusiasts as presidential candidates for both of the political parties? If not, what system are they referring to?</p>
<p><i>As much as his anti-immigration views render him noxious to the Northern California mainstream, his turning away from an embrace of freedom make him an enemy to the rebellious thinkers he&rsquo;s hired.</i></p>
<p>Let me get this straight:<br>
1.)Opposing immigration is a minority political position in Northern California<br>
2.)Supporting immigration is a rebellious political position in Northern California</p>
<p>So the writer of the article would like us to believe that immigration enthusiasts are rebels who support the majority and fight the system?</p>

		<p>Immigration reform organizations would be much better off being subsidized by small donations from ordinary White Americans than by wealthy Libertarians. Taking millions from a few wealthy Libertarians could very easily result in self-censorship at these organizations. I don&rsquo;t trust wealthy libertarians such as Theil.</p>
<p>At a time when non-white MSM types such as the mulatto Soledade O&rsquo;Brian-daughter of two LEGAL immigrants- announced on national TV a declaration of war against White  Males on Nov 3 2008,Roy Beck continues to push the lie that post-1965 non-white LEGAL immigrants are not responsible for the perpetuation of post-1965 immigration policy. </p>
<p>LEGAL asian immigrants are actively participating in the  racial and economic dispossession of Native Born White Americans.The hindu &#8220;americans&#8221; own 150 members of US congress. The term &#8220;White Americans&#8221; can not be mentioned on the  numbersusa.com website Roy Beck has gone out of his way to staff numbersusa with young post-1965 non-whites. Roy Beck completely basis the case against immigration based upon how it supposedly harms post-1965 non-whites. I could care less about saving for the gene-line of the predatory hindu,korea,sikh and chinese &#8220;american&#8221; comminuty.</p>
<p>I refuse to financially support numbersusa.com because at numbersusa, Native Born White Americans have been whitted out with Roy Becks disgusting pc. </p>
<p>Beck has so much sympathy for blacks. Why? Blacks have just forced a anti-white mulatto bigot on White America who is hell-bent on making Native Born White Americans an ever dwindling racial minority in America as soon as possible. </p>
<p>To Roy Beck:Post-1965 non-whites-hispanics,asians,muslims and blacks from africa-are waging an agressive demographic war-outbreeding White Americans- against Native Born White Americans. THIS IS NATIVE BORN WHITE BASHING!!!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been a big part of the anti-illegal immigration movement for many years.  I barely pay attention to NumbersUSA.  I feel Save Our State and the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps are doing the most good.  Also a small group called No More Invasion.  Right now, ending Birthright Citizenship is a top priority.  It&rsquo;s ridiculous that pregnant women can come here from the Middle East, give birth (making their offspring an American citizen), and then raise the child in the Middle East.  Modern transportation makes the birthright citizenship concept obselete. </p>

<p>Posted by Minuteman:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s equally infuriating that here in California, a pregnant mexican woman can cross the border, give birth to a &#8216;new&rsquo; American, at taxpayer expense, and not be deported.</p>
<p>In fact, the new citizen is immediately eligible for WIC, a free anti-White, government-sponsored education and other hand-out programs  &mdash;  AND he will cut in front of YOUR children for AA job preferences and college placements when the time comes.  At 21, he can &#8216;fix&rsquo; the papers of his family members and sponsor even more  to come here and repeat this process.  Entire villages in mexico have emptied out using these tactics.  </p>
<p>Savage calls this a daisy chain  &mdash;  chain of insanity is more like it, as California and other border states go broke and hospitals close their doors, and as mexicans and central americans continue to send the cash they earn in the US back to mexico while depending on US taxpayers to fund their living expenses, medical care and the education of their children.</p>
<p>And from Jupiter:</p>

		<p>NumbersUSA is a very mainstream organization.  It is in no way concerned with the racial issues that American Renaissance is.  It opposes mass immigration for sound environmental reasons (remember when environmentalists favored zero population growth?) and to preserve American jobs for Americans (including American blacks).  In fact, NumbersUSA is so moderate that it isn&rsquo;t even on the SPLC&rsquo;s hate group list.</p>
<p>It is a sad day when a man feels that he has to hide his contributions to such an organization, as if it was something to be ashamed of.  I&rsquo;d say the numerous corporations that proudly contribute to La Raza have a lot more to answer for.<br>

<p>Every time I have seen Roy Beck on TV-Lou Dobbs in particular-he blathers on and on how immigration must be cut back because it harms blacks and immigrants who have arrived here recently. On the numbersusa.com website, you will find the same thing. You would never know that there was a very large Native Born White American population that is being severely harmed by post-1965 non-white immigration policy. </p>
<p>Now consider this:on election night Nov 3 2008, MSM media pesonalities such as Soledade O&rsquo;Brian-a multimillioniare married to an investment banker and many others-announced gleefully that America will no longer look like Joe the Plumber a Native Born White Male. The blacks and the post-1965 non-whites whom Roy Beck wants to protect from non-white post-1965 non-white immigrants,on Nov 3 2008, imposed a anti-white black president on Native Born White Americans who is openly enthusisatic and hell-bent on reducing Native Born White Americans-as fast as possible- to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. Or to put it another way,blacks,hispanics,asians and muslims are openly waging a raced based war agianst the majority Native Born White American population. On Nov 3 2008 at eleven o&rsquo;clock, blacks and post-1965 non-whites began to publicly taunt Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Numersusa.com and Roy Beck has never acknowledged that Native Born White Americans exist and that they are being greatly harmed by post-1965 non-white immigrants. By accepting one million dollars from a homosexual Silicon Valley venture capitalist, you can be very certain that Roy Beck will never mention the fact that  White Americans exist. The one million dollars will be used to do market rsearch to identify other well-to- do White liberal and libertarian types who  will never tolerate a focused analysis on how post-1965 non-white immigration harms Native Born White Americans.</p>

 <br>
&#8220;I see your point but I can understand why Roy Beck has to do what he has to do. Underneath, I strongly suspect race has a lot to do with it but Mr.Beck knows that if he made it a racial issue, the media would crucify him and there would be many Whites who not join because they wouldn&rsquo;t want to be &#8220;racist&#8221;. By ignoring race and sticking to other issues such as the true fact that we cannot continue to support massive immigration at the levels we currently have, he will get more Whites as well as Blacks and other citizens to join the cause.</p>
