				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Walberg, Chicago Breaking News Center, Nov. 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least five people were arrested across the city after Barack Obama&rsquo;s rally in Grant Park, including a woman who slapped a Chicago police officer, saying police couldn&rsquo;t arrest her anymore, prosecutors said today. </p>
<p>Most of the others celebrated the historic occasion with gunfire. </p>
<p>Celita Hart, 19, stood silently in court today when she appeared for a bond hearing.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Hart, who is black, yelled &ldquo; &lsquo;White [expletive], [expletive] McCain &mdash; you white police can&rsquo;t do nothing anymore.&rsquo;&ldquo;  With that, she reached through the window of a squad car and slapped a white male officer in the face, according to Assistant State&rsquo;s Atty. Lorraine Scaduto. </p>
<p>The incident occurred after police responded to a crowd of people celebrating Obama&rsquo;s win on the corner of 69th Street and Western Avenue.  Hart, of the 7100 block of South Rockwell Street, was charged with aggravated battery of a police officer and was ordered her held in lieu of $10,000 bail.</p>
<p>Others who appeared before Circuit Judge Israel Desierto included Andre Murph, 37, of Aurora, who was arrested after police saw him shooting a handgun into the ground on the Southwest Side.</p>
<p>Scaduto said he told the officers he was &ldquo;shooting to celebrate Obama as president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Narada Thomas, 23, of the 1200 North Central Avenue, allegedly gave a similar explanation after he was arrested with a handgun near his home. &ldquo;He said he had the gun because he wanted to celebrate Obama becoming the first black president,&rdquo; Scaduto said.</p>
<p>Kenneth Smith, 24, of the 6700 block of South Ada Street, was arrested after he allegedly fired a handgun outside his home. Smith, who is on parole for a previous weapons conviction, told authorities that &ldquo;the police only arrested him because a black man won for president,&rdquo; Scaduto said.</p>
<p>Robert Morgan, 54, of the 5700 South Lowe Avenue, appeared to have simply been caught up in the excitement.</p>
<p>When officers arrested him for allegedly firing a handgun into the air from his back porch, &ldquo;He told the officers, &lsquo;Everyone else is shooting off their guns &mdash; I figured, why not?&rsquo;&ldquo; Scaduto said.<br/>

<p>Everyone else? I guess the liberals haven&rsquo;t much to say about guns in these situations. We are in for some hard times in this nation. </p>

			<p>If only blacks were as creative in other areas as they are in cooking up bizarre excuses for their anti-social and criminal behavior.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least five people were arrested across the city after Barack Obama&rsquo;s rally in Grant Park, including a woman who slapped a Chicago police officer, saying police couldn&rsquo;t arrest her anymore&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This sort of thing is exactly what many of us predicted on these very boards. Now that Big Chief is in power, all that foreign &#8220;law and order&#8221; stuff can be safely ignored.</p>

			<p>Thanks for posting this article.  It just gave me the first big laugh I&rsquo;ve had since the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;saying police couldn&rsquo;t arrest her anymore&#8221;.  I love it.  Guess she&rsquo;s been arrested before?  These Obama supporters will just have to be disappointed one by one&hellip;one at a time until the dream is gone.</p>

			<p>Celita Hart is a perfect candidate for a hate crime charge. Its time to put some pressure on the Chicago prosecutors office to have this appropriately charged so as to discourage other stupidity. Given the brazen actions, and direct comment of the offender, its hard to believe this crime was motivated by anything other than pure racial hatred &amp; as an act to intimidate government from carrying out essential functions (this also falls under our current definition of &#8220;terrorism&#8221;).   Pick your poison. </p>

			<p>Yes, &#8216;questiondiversity&rsquo;, but if this ridiculous election starts America on the road to breaking up on a political/racial basis, it might turn out to be for the best.</p>
<p>America has turned the corner and is becoming a third-world nation at breakneck speed. With the only way of stopping and reversing this, being by an eventual dissolution of the union, followed by forcibly driving out minorities and reconquering the land, step by step. Impossible? I don&rsquo;t think so. No one would stupidly toss nukes around in our country. (The fall-out could ultimately hurt the tossers as much as the intended victims.) Whites DO hold the aces   &mdash;   brains, initiative, driving will, as well as the numerical advantage. So ultimately, the U.S. of A. could very well be reconquered and restored. If White Americans have the will.</p>

<p>   These types of incidents will only increase with the realization that the white power structure in this country is slowly being dismantled.  I also suspect that these types of incidents might be underreported as no doubt the police were instructed to &#8216;show restraint&rsquo; on a night like this.</p>
<p>   The most striking thing to me in my hometown of Atlanta, GA were the black youth, supposedly from Georgia State, who flooded the downtown streets dancing, jumping, bumping, all in NY Yankees baseball caps and long white t-shirts, etc&hellip;it looked like Freaknik all over again.</p>

			<p>These submoronic IQ types&hellip; will DO MORE to hurt Obama than any amount of White racism ever will. Let them riot and rant. 2012 is coming. With even moderate luck, Obama will be unceremoniously dumped like Jimmy Carter. His oponent winning by a higher percentage than Obama beat McCain by.</p>
<p>To the super-intelligent (also minority) voters&hellip; let me point out that it was NOT as much an Obama win as it was a McCain LOSS! I realize thinking is a bit difficult for some. More so, if big words (over one syllable) are used. But I&rsquo;ll try&hellip; </p>
<p>What knocked McCain down was that he was McCAIN! Seen far and wide as a loyal Bush stooge. A man who couldn&rsquo;t open his mouth without shooting himself in the foot. A man who couldn&rsquo;t select a running mate by careful scrutiny. Who instead picked Palin on an apparent whim and lived to regret his stupidity. (Palin and McCain were hardly in an amicable relationship at the end, per a story I read in the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Palin also had more than enough baggage the media was quick to dig up&hellip; more than enough to just about sink the pair.) McCain might have had enough military smarts to understand you just can&rsquo;t shut the Iraq and Afghanistan wars off like hitting a light switch. But beyond that&hellip; you can write off McCain&rsquo;s military expertise also.</p>
<p>So before you Black readers start crowing over Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;win&#8221;, you might reflect on reality. Had the Republicans been smart enough to take McCain aside, tell him it&rsquo;s time to bow out (on health reasons, or something) and put a worthwhile candidate in&hellip; Obama would NEVER EVER have won! Sure, the economy is a stinking mess. But certainly blamable equally on BOTH parties. Never mind the buck passing, the blame game. BOTH parties!</p>
<p>But with 2012 really not so far away after all&hellip; All we have to do is sit back. Wait, and watch. Barky will screw up big-time sooner or later. His wife might blunder and say the wrong thing (again). Obama&rsquo;s unsavory friends might visit at the White House. It wouldn&rsquo;t take much to turn American opinion sharply against Obama. If that happens&hellip; Well betting on this is like betting the sun will shine somewhere tomorrow&hellip; That Democratic Congress will distance themselves from Barky as fast, if not faster, as Obama pulled himself away from his &#8220;good friend, family pastor&#8221;, Jeremiah Wright. Call it politics&hellip; if you want.</p>

			<p>Since armed self-defense is legal in most of the US, the increasing belligerance of the &#8220;winners&#8221; of this election may be a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Shooting firearms into the air?  That&rsquo;s really good.  I guess these numbskulls don&rsquo;t understand that those bullets have to come back DOWN somewhere (going quite fast, at that!)</p>

<p>Right on the money. Does anyone really think that white-hating blacks are going to be mollified in their attitudes towards whitey because Obama is president? Some head-in-the-sand, limousine liberal fools, perhaps; but the manifest behavior of our enricher friends is the real barometer. As you stated, QD, things for white people are quite likely only going to get worse as these &#8216;folks&rsquo; are only going to be emboldened to act out their racial hatred.<br/>

			<p>I can honestly say that I expected a lot more violence, rioting and looting after Obama&rsquo;s win.  I knew that if he lost, it was a sure thing.</p>
<p>I guess every dark cloud does have a silver lining.  At least, we won&rsquo;t have to paying gazillions of dollars to rebuild riot torn cities.  </p>
<p>Grab a hold of your pocketbooks and your weapons, because it&rsquo;s going to get a whole lot worse than a bunch of blacks shooting guns off.  The theft of our money will start in earnest very soon.  </p>

			<p>So since President Elect Obama won there is a sense of &#8220;black pride&#8221; in that African Americans are now in control and [they] do not have to &#8220;take it anymore from the man&#8221; do they?</p>
<p>AND, if Senator Obama had lost then once again the white man would have unduly stolen something from the noble African American, who has given so much to this country while being forced to live under the shackles of slavery.</p>
<p>I dare say that you will begin to notice a subtle change in attitude on the part of every African American with respect to how they deal with YOU from this point forward. I&rsquo;ve already noticed it in my area as well. </p>
<p>AND, if you happen to be white, it is not going to be pleasant, irrespective of whether or not you voted for, or still have the Obama sticker on your car.</p>

<p>I remember riding on a city bus in Los Angeles, just about exactly 50 years ago   &mdash;   late 50s, 1958. There was a loud, angry black woman carrying on in the back of the bus, haranguing the white passengers, yelling that &#8220;You just wait and see. We&rsquo;re going to take over this whole damn city.  We&rsquo;re going to be in charge, and you&rsquo;ll be taking orders from US.  Someday this is all going to be OURS!&#8221;&hellip; and so on, blah, blah.  (I don&rsquo;t think she said &#8220;honkies&#8221; because that term wasn&rsquo;t in use yet.) Everyone assumed she was deranged and didn&rsquo;t take her seriously.  Most people just hunched down and tried to ignore her. </p>
<p>But no, she wasn&rsquo;t crazy. Not at all! She was exactly on the money! She was a prophet. In fact, she only predicted taking over Los Angeles (which they did, long ago, with Mayor Bradley in 1973    &mdash;   something whites in 1958 could not imagine), but she UNDERESTIMATED their success.  Even she would never have imagined in her wildest dreams that the USA would have a black president in 50 years. And, craziest thing of all, that black president was elected by a bunch of loopy, white, brainwashed  lemmings!  No, she could never have imagined that! I&rsquo;m sure she would be ecstatic if she&rsquo;s alive today to see it.<br/>

<p>Dream on. The Cook County State&rsquo;s Attorney elect, hispanic Anita Alvarez, campaigned on a promise to &#8220;fight for legislation to slow &#8216;the flow of illegal guns&rsquo; &#8221; (as she called it) and to &ldquo;ensure there are enough resources to battle domestic violence and increase minority hiring.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be too optomistic that charging minorities with hate crimes will be high on her agenda.<br/>
