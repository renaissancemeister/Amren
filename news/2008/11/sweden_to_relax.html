				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>IANS, Nov. 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sweden is all set to relax its existing immigration laws to make the country more accessible for thousands of low-skilled workers, seeking employment in the Scandinavian nation.Swedish Minister for Migration and Asylum Policy Tobias Billstrom, while speaking at a programme organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the country would amend the existing laws, opening up its shores to blue-collar workers outside Europe.</p>
<p>The country will also give out a generous two-year work permit which will be eligible for Extension several times, he said. </p>
<p>The current rules permit immigration of only highly skilled workers on a work permit of one-year, extendable up to six more months.</p>
<p>Billstrom stated that migration was positive force in the increasingly globalised world and this was the reason behind the Swedish government&rsquo;s decision to reform the immigration regime in several decades.</p>
<p>He added that the migration board of Sweden would avoid social dumping and exploitation by the employer by ensuring that the alien workers get benefits at par with Swedish workforce.</p>
<p>The migration policy also has the clause of right to family reunification, enabling migrants&rsquo; family members to seek jobs in the labour market.<br/>

<p>That would be too sensible and of course this has nothing to do with good sense and everything to do with politicians selling out their own people and working towards creating a class of powerless slaves subservient to the Marxist state. It is always the same story with these people. There is no possible peace of coexistence with them. </p>

<p>As has been pointed out, assimilation IS NOT the goal of these 3rd worlders. Faster of slower is unimportant, just that the 3rd worlders (muslims mostly I suspect) take over entirely.</p>

<p>So they&rsquo;ve dropped even the &#8220;labor shortage&#8221; argument then?  Is this really the best rationale the Swedish government can come up with?  Even King George III didn&rsquo;t act quite this arbitrarily.</p>

			<p>Sweden doesn&rsquo;t realize that when you get low-skilled 3rd worlders, there are many costs. They have high birthrates and little education, so they end up using all kinds of welfare benefits.  Their low salaries don&rsquo;t cover their living expenses. They and their many kids don&rsquo;t speak the language so it costs money to teach them and educate them. Along with the poverty, they bring are all kinds of social problems such as crime, cultural clashes and racial tensions. When their numbers get large enough, they start trying to change your society and make all kinds of demands. Cheap labor is never cheap. The other poster is right, look to eastern europe.</p>

			<p>Here these Multiculturalist go again. First Rhodisha, than South Africa, than the US. And now their off to Europe the next stop to continue their tren to make whites die out, and to replace their leader with non-whites. Keep allowing immigrants and you will have a Obama soon enough. These people are out to remove our race, the multi-culturalist.</p>

I&rsquo;m serious, I&rsquo;m certain that there are a bunch of them who are asking themselves, &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t we have a cool President/Premier/Prime Minister like America?&#8221;  A race to the bottom.  </p>

			<p>There was a report early this year or last year that up to 20-25% of Swedes are buried in hidden forms of unemployment like extended schooling and retraining. They don&rsquo;t need more immigrants at all. Once again the neo-marxist and capitalist rulers of Sweden are changing this once-fine (if highly taxed but peaceful) nation and people into a U.S.-style melting pot where the dominant ethnic group has no specific rights of its own.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s not much to defend in Sweden&rsquo;s idiotic immigration policy.  </p>
<p>The one silver lining, is that the Swedes in the past have in general limited their low-skill immigration to eastern European countries and, even with this change, most of the visas are relegated to the &#8220;new EU&#8221; members like Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.  (Their high-skill immigration, of course, comes from all over the world, mostly from Russia but also Korea and India.)  And this still-preliminary proposal allows for small numbers.  </p>
<p>Still, I don&rsquo;t have much confidence in Sweden&rsquo;s idiotic, PC-overtaken government.  Only Britain, Canada, Australia and (increasingly) the USA are worse in their kowtowing to politically correct orthodoxy and practice.</p>

			<p>Immigration is not simply adding to the population but actually a displacement of the native population.<br/>
Immigrants compete for resources, more noticeably wages in modern times, making it difficult or impossible for native population to reproduce adequately to sustain itself.<br/>
It is a one-to-one displacement (replacement) or <i>more</i> depending on extent of genetic dissimilarity of invading population.<br/>
This is from paper by Dr.Frank Salter.</p>

			<p>I hate to say this, but a serious and protracted depression is about the only thing that will wake the well schooled white idiots from their sleepwalking condition. Perhaps when they literally have to fight the invaders for that next meal, will they finally get the fact that any moral system that does not put their own survival paramount is not a moral code at all but a racket and a weapon in the hands of their enemies. Good means whatever is necessary for OUR PEOPLE to survive and flourish in this world. Now repeat that to yourself and everyone you know. My Home Schooled  children already know it.</p>

<p>Now though they seem to have decided, nationaly and racially, to commit mass suicide.</p>
<p>Very sad. </p>

There are already lots of them here in Sweden, as there are quite a lot of Swedes in those countries as well, the latter obviously not as cheap labour. This is EU and free migration within the EU borders. Although there are some limitations, there is nothing much to add here.<br/>
Cheap labour from Asia is a completely different kettle of fish.</p>

			<p>It really is just any excuse with the multiculturalist/globalist zealots.</p>
<p>If there really are labour shortages in a country, just tough out the lean times for a generation and encourage the indigenous population to breed by outlawing abortion, giving tax-breaks and other financial incentives to (heterosexual) indigenous married couples and reversing the lunatic influence of feminism and so-called gay rights in academe and the media.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t so difficult, was it?</p>

			<p>Of course, the basic law of economics is the law of supply and demand.If supply rises, then demand (as expressed in wages) for the unskilled (always the most vulnerable and worst paid section of society) falls - in the case of the unskilled there is no natural &#8216;floor&rsquo; for the level of wages and the Victorian doctrine of the &#8216;iron law of wages&rsquo; (ie subsistence plus reproduction), still holds absolutely true in 2008 as in 1808 - this is an inmutable and logical economic law that has been found to be true by empirical evidence in every society of the world where labor is super-abundant - it is not just paper theorizing, which, alas, most modern &#8216;economics&rsquo; is.<br/>
   One would have thought the good socialists of Sweden would have realised this.</p>

I don&rsquo;t agree with you on that, JR, although I share your annoyance and disgust.<br/>
I see the Swedes as <i>victims,  </i>not culprits.  I feel sorry for them. They are fine people who have been victimized and are messed up. Would you blame someone for his condition who&rsquo;s been kidnapped, tied up, drugged, and held hostage?</p>
<p>Marxism in Sweden took a different route than in communist Russia.  Socialist Sweden escaped the wars and bloodbaths. It took a more peaceful, gradual path. But both roads led to the same destination.  The Swedes have been held hostage and brainwashed  by socialistic governments for nearly a century. They have been brainwashed and mind-drugged with anti-racism propaganda by their schools and media for all their lives.   This is the  inevitable result that we are seeing.   </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame them too harshly. All they know is what they&rsquo;re told.  (In fact, aren&rsquo;t Americans much the same?)</p>

			<p>So every unemployed Sedish worker will not only be competeing with the few million other Swedes for any job opportunities but with the entire working age population of India (numbering around 800 million persons)- and what&rsquo;s more a population to whom a daily wage of $1 is a luxury.<br/>
 How can the Swedish government hate its people so much?</p>
