<h1>US Immigrant Groups to March a Day After Obama Takes Over</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jordi Zamora Jordi Zamora, Agence France Presse. November 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrant rights organizations have called for a major march on Washington on January 21, the day after Barack Obama is sworn in as the 44th US president.</p>
<p>Defenders and advocates of tens of millions of immigrants will take to the streets to press their case for immigration reform and remind Obama of one of the policy planks he plugged on the campaign stump as he wooed the Hispanic vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;On January 21 we will be here in Washington to ask for reforms and for an end to the raids&#8221; at workplaces that have seen illegal immigrants arrested and deported, said Angelica Salas, director of the Los Angeles-based Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ask the president-elect to consider immigration reform one of his 10 domestic priorities,&#8221; she told reporters Tuesday, adding that she hoped reform legislation would begin &#8220;in the first 100 days&#8221; of an Obama administration.</p>
<p>The US Congress failed to pass the most recent version of sweeping immigration legislation, in 2007, which would have given legal status and a path to citizenship for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants residing in the United States.</p>
<p>Obama and his rival in the 2008 presidential race, Republican Senator John McCain, had been involved in negotiations over the text, and immigration reform earned broad support from both Obama and McCain on the 2008 campaign trail.</p>
<p>But in the final months before the election, immigration swiftly took a back seat to the deepening and more pressing economic crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know it is important for our country,&#8221; Salas said, referring to the financial meltdown, but &#8220;we understand that we must also work for the other things that are very important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chung-Wha Hong, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said organizers were &#8220;trying to mobilize tens of thousands of immigrants&#8221; for the march, which would highlight the vital role immigrants could play in an American economic recovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kind of effort we are going to make as a country to get us out of this economic mess is going to be required of any one of us, including immigrants,&#8221; said Chung-Wha.</p>
<p>The immigrant vote proved crucial for an Obama victory, march organizers have said.</p>
<p>Hispanics cast about 10 million votes &mdash; 30 percent more than in 2004, according to experts &mdash; and fully 67 percent of them voted for Obama and for congressional Democrats who reinforced their party&rsquo;s majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<p>With just ten weeks left in the administration of President George W. Bush, Chung-Wha pleaded for a moratorium on the highly controversial raids to round up and deport illegals.</p>
<p>Critics stress that the raids, undertaken by police and the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) division, end up tearing families apart and devastating businesses which serve immigrant communities.</p>
<p>Such raids prompted angry marches in dozens of American cities in 2006.</p>
<p>Organizers of the January 21 march, totaling some 30 nongovernmental organizations, announced they will quickly begin lobbying lawmakers in Congress to drive the immigration agenda.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to push it and keep it as a priority,&#8221; said Jessica Alvarez, president of the National Capital Immigration Coalition.<br>

			<p>Well here we go! I was just waiting for this to come to light again. I guess we can quit our jobs now. We can all go on welfare like the rest of them. Don&rsquo;t worry we&rsquo;ll have healthcare too! Why should we have to work to support all these people? Sooner or later the camels back will break. With Hussein Obama in charge it will all be broken anyway. What&rsquo;s right is wrong; and what&rsquo;s wrong is right!</p>

			<p>How about marching for &#8220;Humane Rights for Americans?&#8221; After all, we have to ante up that $90 billion or so they cost us yearly. We have to endure the crimes they can&rsquo;t stop committing. We even have to endure their mentality and lifestyle that also comes with the illegal immigrants. Multiple families in one home, for example.</p>

			<p>Interesting that the economic meltdown is mentioned&hellip;.since immigrants, in large part, caused the meltdown.</p>
<p>Obama is going to have to make a decision soon.  Will he permanently make the US a one party state firmly in the grip of the democrats forever afterward&hellip;.but, at the same time, remove the US from first world status and make us a defacto bannana republic?  Or will he cement his win another way by actually solving the problems this country faces&hellip;.and a big part of the problem are immigrants, both legal and illegal.</p>
<p>Obama is already elected.  He would have good reason to simply ignore the unreasonable desires of illegals and even institute real immigration reform (ie stop illegals and kick out the ones already here).  It would make him immensely popular.  Of course, we have good reason to believe that Obama is not a legitimate candidate but is simply here to crash the system.</p>
<p>I have a feeling though that, if Obama floods the country with mexicans and attempts to redistribute wealth via an immense tax and welfare state, he will be looking at a tax revolt and seccession of several of the states.  I&rsquo;m thinking nearly a third (the most productive third) of the US would simply tell him to go shove it.</p>

			<p>Whatever Obama does in response to the march by illegal aliens (I refuse to refer to them as &#8220;immigrants&#8221;), it is unlikely to exceed anything McCain would have done.</p>
<p>Do we need more proof than in-your-face demands by unchallenged invaders that this is no longer our country?   </p>

			<p>The great liberal coalition against whites didn&rsquo;t last long did it?  </p>
<p>Sounds like the hispanics activists are going to be much more demanding of Obama than they have been of any  white President.<br>

<p><br>
Get real! Most immigrants cost America money, rather than fill the national coffers. Medical care, public education, incarceration, legal fees, welfare, food stamps&hellip; the list is seemingly endless. If America is to recover from the current economic crisis, then it needs to halt immigration entirely. An amnesty in 2008 will only do what the 1986 amnesty did - endorse illegal behavior and encourage more unwashed third world hordes to unlawfully enter and make yet more demands.</p>

I saw this group on c-span the other day. Here&rsquo;s their website:</p>

<p>Whichever party won was going to &#8216;reach out&rsquo; to these immigrant groups. The Democrats take the credit and votes. America takes a fatal hit.</p>

<p>And what I believe, is that we are already seeing the nonwhite entitlement groups overextending themselves before their &#8220;savior&#8221; has even taken the oath of office. In 2006, a time of relative prosperity and peace (well at least free of any major terrorist attacks on US soil) these marches were met with reactive contempt, because of their celebrations of lawlessness and ignorant alien arrogance. How much more wild and bizarre will they be, once the &#8220;savior&#8221; has ascended?</p>
<p>My guess is, like the drunken Russian rapists and pillagers in Berlin 1945!</p>
<p>And what will this all mean for Comrade BO and his fellow Democrat tools and fools in Congress?</p>
<p>A big problem, since they and he probably understand that they have at best 6 to 8 months to make good on all their windy &#8220;promises&#8221; or face first effusive apathy and then enraged antipathy from the majority of their protagonists and antagonists alike. Remember, they run the show now and it is supposed to be: sunshine, rainbows, lollipops, and everything for everybody now. There are to be no races or competitions in other words, only prises for all!</p>
<p>Good luck with that!</p>
<p>In 2010, I expect that the Wizard of Oddbama and his pals in Congress will be at each others&rsquo; throats and sinking on the &#8220;ship of state.&#8221;</p>
<p>What more to say, other then, God let it be so!</p>

			<p>The fix is in on this one. I&rsquo;m guessing that the Obama people and leftist Democrats are working feverishly behind the scenes  to stoke up the illegal immigrant protest pressure to force amnesty legislation. I&rsquo;m sure the lefties are licking their chops at all the new Democratic minority voters amnesty will bring, as well as the resultant chain immigration. The scary part is, when you match the new minority redistributionists with the America hating, self loathing white crowd, you have the makings of a Marxist banana republic that&rsquo;ll stand for a thousand years! Maybe we&rsquo;ll get our own white American homeland after all&hellip;like in their gulag (better not give them any ideas).      </p>

			<p>And we all know what happens when thousands of angry mestizos take to the streets yelling God knows what in Spanish and waving the Mexican flag. I think they ought to have ICE trucks waiting, round up all protesters, and deport them immediately. Most of them are admittedly illegal invaders, and the rest are sympathizers of illegal invaders, so deport all of them. They will have to prove they are legal residents of the United States before they are allowed back in. (Most of them will illegally invade again anyway, but we should make it as hard as possible for them.)</p>

			<p>Do you think it possible for White Nationalists to utilize their superior organizational skills and within the next 76 days mount an equally impressive counter protest? One would think that if citizens, nationwide, bombarded a few select government sites with email and phone calls for one single day, we might, at a minimum, give the impression to our representatives in D.C that they do not have 100% support for their amnesty plans. We should call offering praise as well as support for ICE and the work that they do and push for more enforcement, not less.</p>
<p>If we, as a group, with a single common goal are incapable of organizing and intelligently networking this one simple action, then we deserve whatever we get. </p>

<p>Yeah, just like they&rsquo;re contributing to the &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; economic recovery in California.  </p>
<p>It makes perfect sense that the 10 billion dollars these illegals are sucking out of California taxpayers each year is indeed contributing to the state&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in California, home of economic lunacy:</p>
<p>During his 2006 re-election campaign, Schwarzenegger said of new taxes, &#8216;I totally rule it out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This statement was made despite a 40% increase in state spending in the past four years under Governor Arnold.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-matsusaka17-2008jul17%2C0%2C7957570.story" rel="nofollow">https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-matsusaka17-2008jul17%2C0%2C7957570.story</a></p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The state&rsquo;s revenue collapse is so bad that if lawmakers did nothing, California would face $22 billion shortfalls each year from 2010 to 2014&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Taylor&rsquo;s report Tuesday said cuts alone will not solve California&rsquo;s budget deficit because the state&rsquo;s weakening economy is cutting the flow of tax revenue&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I know&hellip;let&rsquo;s raise taxes to solve Mexifornia&rsquo;s fiscal problems!</p>
<p>According to Assembly Republican Leader Mike Villines:<br>
.<br>
&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;higher taxes will doom the economy.&rsquo; and &#8216;If you raise taxes in a down economy, what it does is, it perpetuates the downfall, instead of coming out quick,&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In the California politburo, insanity reigns and Villines and the few Republicans that are left are being vilified for not going along with the Central Plan:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Last week, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&hellip;unveiled $4.7 billion in tax hikes. That money would come from increasing the state&rsquo;s sales tax and car tax &hellip; and by increasing the services that get taxed, such as golf fees and veterinary bills, tickets to sporting events, amusement parks, oil production, alcohol and automobile repairs&hellip;. Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s proposed increase would make California&rsquo;s sales tax&hellip; the highest in the nation, at an average of about 9.5%&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>https://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/v-print/story/1387235.html</p>
<p>And to make large purchases Californians wouldn&rsquo;t turn to the Internet, go out of state, offer cash or do without to escape the high state taxes, would they? </p>
<p>It is not possible to have a large entitlement population, illegal or not, and expect an economic recovery  &mdash;  or to expect to bring about an economic recovery by taxing the productive class and regulating businesses out of existence.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s economic madness. Which is it, Mexifornia or Taxifornia?</p>

			<p>I do hope they protest.  Economic conditions can hardly be expected to have improved any by then.  Their protest will be almost sure to mobilize resistance to amnesty.</p>

			<p>In response to the 956pm post:</p>
<p>I was with the Minutemen in protesting amnesty for illegal immigrants in May of 2006&hellip;..Unfortunately, we only had about 200 protesters in our group, and there was a group of counter-protesters about as big as our group.  Fortunately there were policemen between the two groups.  Afterwards we visited the offices of many of the Senators.  For some reason we Native Born White Americans can&rsquo;t seem to get a large turnout for our protests.  It is probably because we have to work so hard to keep this socialist-welfare state going&hellip;&hellip;</p>

			<p>Brothers and Sisters, the problem is not intelligence or organization, God knows our &#8220;representatives&#8221; unfortunately have that, because this nation has not Balkanized yet. The problem is greed. A large contingent of European-Americans are too interested in whether their credit will allow them to buy cars, plasma-screen television&rsquo;s, boats or other made-for-adult toys, not to mention the worthless gadgets their children have been brainwashed into thinking as a necessity. Until we as a people learn to live within our means and trade with each other underground, there is no chance at any type of a rebellion or even a compromise with our most radical adversaries. I could name more than a dozen people among my family and childhood friends who would most likely sell out Western Civilization and all that it stands for in exchange for material comforts/nanny states. This is where the true struggle must begin, from the ground up.</p>
<p>Love of freedom and territory must replace the love of goods.      </p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&ldquo;The kind of effort we are going to make as a country to get us out of this economic mess is going to be required of any one of us, including immigrants,&rdquo;</p>
<p>But were the illegal aliens DEPORTED, think of how saving American TAXPAYERS over $90 Billion a year would speed up the economic recovery!!! Aside from the sharp drop in CRIME, since Hispanics and Blacks deserve credit (BLAME) for some 85% to 90% of domestic crimes.</p>
<p>Finally, if we deport ALL illegal aliens, the businesses and corporations reaping fat profits from illegal immmigrant labor would be forced to choose&hellip; between PAYING AMERICAN WORKERS A FAIR WAGE, or closing or sharply curtailing their business. Since businesses would then pay a better wage to attract AMERICAN workers, our people would benefit. Getting off welfare roles; by working and paying taxes, the workers themselves living better, regaining a measure of self-esteem in no longer being supported by our taxpayers.</p>
<p>If anyone has the e-mail addresses or fax numbers of these pro-immigration groups, maybe we should flood them with mail to point out how much BETTER OFF Americans would be with the deporation of illegal aliens! Please POST such e-mai addresses and fax numbers for us if you have them.</p>
<p>P.S. It might not hurt to send OBAMA similar but politely worked mail. Kind of making The Great Man THINK for a change.</p>

			<p>American corporate greed is the main cause of our immigration problems. Immigration, illegal or not, would end tommorrow if greedy White americans didn&rsquo;t hire them. Greedy White americans are the cause of the problem. If we want to blame someone, look no further than our fellow americans who eschew their own countrymen so they can fill their pockets.</p>

<p>Yes, it is possible to organize against it.  We should all plan to BOMBARD both the House and the Senate with letters, faxes, and phone calls declaring that we don&rsquo;t want amnesty in any form.  Scheduling them for a the 2-3 days prior to inauguration would probably be most effective.  </p>

			<p>They will be march and American citizens, as usuall will have the Duhhhh, expression on their faces and for that matter, the significance of it all, will go right over the heads of most Americans, as they busy themselves with their everyday sublimations towards their problems.(football, baseball, basketball, golf, tennis, soccer moms, the mall, etc.) It&rsquo;s just incredible to think that with the criminality that has been ongoing in this nation for some 40 years, it really does&rsquo;nt shake up most citizens. In fact it hardly leaves a dent.</p>

			<p>Here is what we have to look forward to when Mexico and America become one nation.  </p>
<p>Fox News currently has an article [Veteran Crime Reporter Shot Dead in Mexico Border City, November 13, 2008] that includes, almost as an afterthought, these final two paragraphs:</p>
<p>On Wednesday, an anonymous banner appeared at the door of a public Juarez kindergarten, threatening to attack the school&rsquo;s children if the teachers don&rsquo;t hand over their Christmas bonuses.</p>
<p>Classes were immediately suspended as police decided what security measures to take.</p>

<p>This is so true. Sadly, most  White male americans today are too busy in front of their big screen TV drinking beer and watching the BIG GAME. They get more upset if their wives don&rsquo;t hand them another beer fast enough than they do over the fact that their country is being invaded by the millions. On the other hand, the White female american is too busy focusing on the latest sale at THE MALL and gets more upset if she misses out on those really cute pair of boots at Macy&rsquo;s then she does that her country is being invaded by the millions. Only something really bad will ever wake whitey up.</p>

<p>Well said.  More and more Americans are getting fed up with the never-ending mobs of illegal invaders and their open-border supporters taking to our streets and demanding for our complete surrender!  </p>
<p>America is drowning under the financial and cultural weight of this ever-growing illegal alien invasion, and states are now begging for government handouts while trying to control the rampant increase in crime&hellip;  Gover Arnold comes to mind.  </p>
<p>Americans have a clear choice&hellip;  America or Mexico-El Norte.  Which shall it be?</p>
<p>If you live in California, please check out CAPS (Californians for Population Stabilization) to send faxes as well as Numbers USA..  Other sites worth checking out are American Thinker, Western Voices World News, and World Net Daily&hellip;</p>

			<p>Let them march, it will only throw more fuel on the smoldering embers of ethnic cleansing that is destined to become a flash fire that will consume them all.  Of course you always have the option of doing nothing more than complaining, believing that your angst will set them to flight.  In that case I suggest you begin rehearsing the speech you&rsquo;ll need to give your progeny when they ask you why you did nothing while unarmed Hispanic bottom feeders stole their country&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;On January 21 we will be here in Washington to ask for reforms and for an end to the raids&rdquo; at workplaces that have seen illegal immigrants arrested and deported, said Angelica Salas,&#8221;</p>
<p>Give the guy a break. At least wait till he unpacks.  </p>
<p>The Democratic party is like a pack of wolves.  They cooperate when campaigning or hunting their prey, but once they win, they are now fighting to see who gets the choicests part of the carcass.</p>
<p>And Angelica Salas.  If her parents had stayed in Mexico, she&rsquo;d be either a low paid or factory slave.  </p>
<p>In Mexico, when someone who looks like her tries to enter a good restaurant or register at a nice hotel, she is told &#8220;sorry, all these tables or rooms are reserved.&#8221;</p>
<p>But come to America and this metizo who would have been forced out of 5th grade in Mexico to go to work is the affirmative action head of a non profit making 3 figures a year.</p>
