<h1>La Raza: Losing Jobs to Illegals Is &lsquo;Not a Concern&rsquo; of Americans</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tiffany Gabbay, CNS (Cybercast News Service) News, November 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Americans are &#8220;not concerned&#8221; that they may lose jobs to illegal aliens in a tight job market, according to speakers at a panel discussion conducted Thursday in Washington, D.C., by the National Council of La Raza.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Research conducted for La Raza, which describes itself as the &#8220;largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States,&#8221; indicates that Americans are &#8220;more concerned&#8221; with undocumented immigrants &#8220;being able to pay their fair share of taxes,&#8221; Rosenberg [Simon Rosenberg, president and CEO of NDN &mdash; formerly the New Democrat Network] said, than they are of losing jobs to illegals.</p>
<p>When asked if he still felt that American jobs would not be threatened by undocumented immigrants despite the fact the current unemployment rate is now at a 14-year high of 6.5 percent, Rosenberg told CNSNews.com that he believes undocumented immigrants have taken jobs that Americans &#8220;do not want,&#8221; but that there &#8220;might be&#8221; a shift in concern if unemployment rates continue to rise.</p>
<p>David Mermin, a partner at Lake Research Partners, a national public opinion and political strategy research firm hired by La Raza to study American voters, said 62 percent of American voters are now &#8220;more interested in converting illegal immigrants into legal taxpayers than deporting them because they might be taking jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of steps to becoming &#8220;legal,&#8221; Mermin explained that &#8220;paying taxes, passing a criminal background check and learning English&#8221; are the most important factors to voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pollster Mermin said his data revealed a large majority of American voters &#8220;broadly support&#8221; comprehensive immigration reform &mdash; and that supporters of enforcement-only policies, such as raids on employers, &#8220;may be loud, but there aren&rsquo;t very many of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mermin said 67 percent of both Obama and McCain voters support a &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221; for illegal immigrants, compared to just 10 percent of Obama voters and 20 percent of McCain voters who say that illegal immigrants &#8220;must leave the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rosenberg added that American&rsquo; attitudes toward race have changed and that Republicans will have to &#8220;make peace&#8221; with the Hispanic community and work towards immigration reform or they will see their electoral map shift from red to blue &#8220;for a generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His &#8220;advice&#8221; to Democrats: &#8220;If you want to get re-elected, pass comprehensive immigration reform.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Message to La Raza:IT IS ABOUT RACE REPLACEMENT. Native Born White Americans want to remain a large racial majority within the borders of America. When enough Native Born White Americans wake up racially, the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans will be reversed. </p>
<p>La Raza is attempting to make an economic case for the mass race-replacment of White Americans. Do not engage in an economic argument for it allows for the possibility of an economic argument being made for the race replacement  of Native Born White Americans within the borders of America. La Raza is completely motivated by race. Avoid the liberal even-handedness of Roy Beck, FAIR and The Center for Immigration Sudies.</p>

			<p>Republicans need Hispanics to get in office and Democrats need Hispanics to stay in office? I find it hard to believe the same votes can help both parties. </p>
<p>If Obama is dumb enough to fall for this then he will lose his black supporters just as the Republicans have lost a good deal of their base. </p>
<p>All blacks in America are not moving on up to the East side or getting their piece of the pie. Blacks voted for Obama to be their man in Washington the same as we vote for the white traitors that keep selling us out. I think it will taking a lot more than looking black to pull this off, many of his supporters may start thinking about his white half. </p>

			<p>In 1986, someone spray painted on a wall in San Francisco  &#8220;no amnesty for illegal aliens&#8221;,just before it was given. I should have taken a picture of it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Republicans will have to &ldquo;make peace&rdquo; with the Hispanic community&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>McCain and Bush could not have surrendered America more the third world invasion, including Latin America, if their lives depended on it.</p>
<p>The facts paint a decidedly bleak picture of America&rsquo;s future under the influence of third-world undesirables and their descendants. For example, consider the latest report on projected state budget deficits. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/9-8-08sfp.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.cbpp.org/9-8-08sfp.htm</a></p>
<p>Based on the data, I prepared a graph to correlate the inverse relationship between &#8220;White only&#8221; population and state budget deficits. I found the same thing that I found in 2005. See the graph below&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/f4663a09a5.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/f4663a09a5.jpg</a></p>
<p>Note the relationship between the presence of minorities and budget deficits. Look closely at the predicted budget deficits for FL, NV, CA, and AZ. Those places are overflowing with Hispanics and the deficits are soaring as responsible Whites pull up stakes and move out. Those states are now third-world states. </p>
<p>(Footnote: On my graph, if a state did not have a predicted budget deficit, I carried the state&rsquo;s deficit as &#8220;0&#8221;. Some of the states listed as &#8220;0&#8221; could actually have budget surpluses, but that was not reported, so I assumed &#8220;0&#8221;).</p>
<p>I looked at the data by state. It would be more interesting to examine large metropolitian areas of Blacks in mostly White states. If budget deficit per county becomes available, I predict the results would be even more striking.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that minorities are having a predicatable, negative effect on the nation. </p>
<p>Intelligence affects behavior, and behavior affects outcomes. One need look no further than Africa, Mexico City, Detroit, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, or any nation, state, or city where undesirables have reached critical mass to see the stark reality.</p>

			<p>Actually I think LaRaza want to convert them into voters.  This is one more reason we need to use E-verify to fire these unwelcomes and sent them back to whence they came from.  </p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;he believes undocumented immigrants have taken jobs that Americans &ldquo;do not want,&rdquo; </i></p>
<p><br>
When I was in high school, lots of guys were talking about making good money in construction after graduation. Since illegals have driven down wages, only illegals can live on low wages of the construction business today.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration is a race to the bottom.<br>

			<p>Where and when did they take a poll or make this study and how did they conduct it?</p>
<p>La Raza is full of liars.  These people really think that they can tell blantant untruths and get away with it because they are armed with words like &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

</i><p>So, if I understand Mr. Rosenberg, Americans don&rsquo;t mind losing jobs to illegals just as long as they are supported by the taxes illegals pay from all those jobs American citizens lose to the illegals?  That&rsquo;s certainly a new twist to the canard that: &#8220;Illegals do the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do.&#8221;  </p></p>

			<p>Of course we don&rsquo;t mind.  We want all the Mexicans to come in, work for us and pay into the welfare system so we white Americans can relax and live the easy life with our black American neighbors.  Get serious already, these La Raza goons are clearly trying to appeal to the least informed majority.</p>

			<p>I watched something on TV a few years back. It was supposed to be a documentary about minimum wage workers. I think it was based a book someone had written. </p>
<p>What struck me was the illegal Mexican woman. They interviewed her in her apartment which was quite nice and had decent furniture. She was supposedly making like $6.50/hour. They also showed how she had a problem with some fine over her car or something and had to come up with three or four hundred dollars. Her car, by the way,looked pretty new. I think she lived in Georgia. </p>
<p>When I saw that documentary, my husband and I had just gone through a bankruptcy and were in terrible financial shape. We went 2years with no central heat and at one point barely had food to eat. I remember coming home one morning after my night shift at an $8/hour job and eating a can of string beans for dinner because the only thing left in the pantry was canned vegetables. A salary of $6.50/hour comes out to $260/week. That is nothing in today&rsquo;s economy!</p>
<p>My question is this. How does a woman making practically nothing live in a nice apartment, nicely furnished, and drive an almost brand new car? If I remember correctly, she also talked about spending thousands of dollars trying to get her son here into the U.S. What is going on here? Where is the money coming from? </p>
<p>Does any Amrener out there have an answer?  </p>

			<p>We could blame the politicians who support and encourage La Raza&rsquo;s denigration of Americans, but we should&rsquo;nt. Who we should blame is a very large segment of the American public which is, I have to say this, BUTT DUMB. BUTT DUMB. WE are allowing our politicians to sell off our factories, we are allowing Wall Street Criminals to operate brazenly, we are allowing Mexican and other foreign nationals to be put in front of Americans. Americans apathy, ignorance and indolence is the foundation that holds up all of the corruption that is occuring in this nation. Sorry, but I had to get this out. If the U.S. goes down, we have only ourselves to blame. Remember,94percent of all incumbents were re-elected. What does that say??</p>

			<p>Taxes? I don&rsquo;t give a flip about taxes. </p>
<p>We need to get control of our borders. That is the first, last, and only issue. </p>
<p>This is being made into a &#8216;race&rsquo; issue by those who intend to con us and take advantage of our idiotic guilt. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because they can&rsquo;t win a debate by any other means. </p>
<p>The government of the United States, just like the government of any other nation, has an obligation to its citizens to secure our border. </p>

<p>I notice this now, at least as far as the new cars go.  My guess is that many Mexicans get here and sign up for new cars, pay later funiture contracts, etc.  They are given free health care and free food.  They are not well educated people as a rule and corruption is part of their culture.  Most I would guess have little intention of paying on the cars and furniture contracts but complain when they cannot.  That deflects the core issue.</p>
<p>I  remember very well how I stood in line with my groceries, less than $10.00 - all I  had after my office had been burglarized and vandalized by a Mexican gang - and waited behind two shopping carts overflowing with groceries by an obvious immigrant farm worker who paid with food stamps.</p>
<p>That last paragraph pretty much sums up the problem with ALL Hispanic immigration.</p>

<p>She doesn&rsquo;t pay taxes since she is illegal and she likely lives with others that are illegal and don&rsquo;t pay taxes. She is likely on food stamps and medicaid so she gets her food and medical free. She likely gets public assistance with her electric bill too. She likely charged her furniture on a credit card and doesn&rsquo;t pay the bill either. She very well could get all this with a fraudulent ID, which is common among illegals. So when you take the fact that she pays no taxes, gets food and medical free as well as other assistance, she does pretty well.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;What is going on here? Where is the money coming from?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In California, many of these parasites work for cash  &mdash;  at the same time receiving the social services mentioned in the above posts  &mdash;  free medical care, free education (with free breakfast and lunch served at school) free or low-cost Section 8 housing (placed in YOUR neighborhood), food stamps WIC, TANF.</p>
<p>They even have billions left to send home to Mexico  &mdash;  billions that could be used to cover the hospital bills that YOU now pay for  &mdash;  including expensive dialysis and organ transplants.</p>
<p>Leo Berman is fighting a valiant, albeit up-hill battle in Texas:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The second bill would put an 8 percent surcharge on money wired from Texas to Mexico, Central and South America, he said. There is about $6 billion each year sent from Texas to Mexico alone, Berman said&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in California, as the economy implodes, 10 billion per year is spent on illegals.</p>
<p>The solution?  Cut services to illegals?  Tax their remittances to Mexico and Central American? Hell NO!</p>
<p>No, in the land of the insane, with its socialist Mexican legislature, the answer is to raise state income taxes, raise the car tax, raise the state sales tax and add a surcharge onto everything from amusement parks to veterinary services.</p>
<p>Wonder who the anti-White Marxists think will pay the favored class&rsquo;s bills when they&rsquo;ve taxed the final business and citizen out of existence?</p>
<p>As for me, I&rsquo;m joining the cash-based economy as much as possible  &mdash;  avoiding state taxes via the Internet, visiting garage sales, offering cash for services as much as possible (that is until CASH becomes worthless).</p>
