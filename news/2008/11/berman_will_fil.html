<h1>Berman Will File 9 Bills About Illegal Immigration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Russel, Tyler (Texas) Morning Telegraph, November 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>State Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, will file nine bills in Austin aiming to reduce the burden of illegal immigration on taxpayers by reducing benefits and protections for illegal immigrants in the state.</p>
<p>Berman said legislators first addressed illegal immigration during the last legislative session, but around 24 bills were killed in committee before they could be voted on by the House. He hopes legislators will consider immigration legislation during the coming session.</p>
<p>The first bill Berman plans to file will challenge automatic citizenship under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The bill says the state of Texas will not issue a birth certificate to children of illegal immigrants born in the state.</p>
<p>Berman said if the bill passes it will invite an immediate lawsuit into a federal court and possibly will require a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 14th Amendment of the Constitution has no application to the children of illegal aliens or any other children of foreigners born in the United States,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are giving away 350,000 citizenships each year (nationally) erroneously and that&rsquo;s why we have to challenge it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second bill would put an 8 percent surcharge on money wired from Texas to Mexico, Central and South America, he said. There is about $6 billion each year sent from Texas to Mexico alone, Berman said.</p>
<p>The bill would require all recaptured funds, almost half-a-billion dollars, be earmarked for border security and hospitals that provide free health care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A bill requiring every level of government in the state to enforce all federal and state laws and constitutions under penalty of losing all state funding will also by filed by Berman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another bill to be filed is identical to a five-part bill passed in Oklahoma that resulted in thousands of illegal immigrants moving from Oklahoma to Texas, Berman said. He said there would be no public state benefits for illegal immigrants and authorizes law enforcement officers to take Section 287 G training with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security allowing them to deal directly with illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill would also prohibit the transportation, concealment or housing of illegal aliens, Berman said. This would make it possible for stiffer penalties to be levied against landlords, employers or traffickers who house, employ and transport illegal immigrants within the state of Texas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Berman said the immigration bills he is filing may be blocked in the Senate or vetoed by the governor, but the need to address illegal immigration remains.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We are giving away 350,000 &#8220;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually about 600,000.  Definitely 500,000 hispanic and about 100,000 people on student visas, and visa overstayers.</p>
<p>There are houses full of asian women in California.  They come over here in the 6 month and have their babies here.  The chinese government sends about one hundred thousand students here every year.  Many of the women get married and have their first child before they leave.</p>

			<p>Having followed Mr. Berman for quite awhile, I&rsquo;ve concluded he is another rare American patriot in office. There are not many these days. These are the representatives that should be supported by Americans with everything we have.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Bobby&#8221; Jindal, hero of the asio-philes on this site - was born to parents who were not US Citizens at the time.  In fact, (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong) his parents overstayed their non-immigrant visas.</p>
<p>There are many more like him.  </p>

			<p>At this moment I am listening to a program, in which a British gentleman known as the Mark Twain of England, is explaining to a clueless liberal, that Englands problems are far worse than Americas and he is talking about social problems.(immigration) He is saying that the problems are dire and are the fault of the British Intellectuals,(liberals)basic dishonesty in dealing with Englands problems. Of course, it&rsquo;s completely going over the head of the liberal show host.</p>

			<p>I do believe that Texas will be the first state to secceed from the union, in frustration and anger, closely followed by several others during the attempted federal government put down of Texas&rsquo; seccession.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, if TX is anything like the other sellout states in this &#8216;Union&rsquo;, the feminazi left wing nuts who live to enforce political correctness, will happily shoot these all down.</p>

			<p>If this misinterpreted law is ever overturned, it will be a great day. The insanity that allows women to step across the border to deliver another little &#8220;citizen,&#8221; is like leaving a trail of honey for ants. Illegal aliens have no regard for the laws of our country and never intend to fully be what is known as an &#8220;American.&#8221; To read the newspapers daily is to see the many crimes committed by those who break into our nation. They are born into a criminal mindset and it governs their lives. Murder, kidnapping, rape, child moslestation, etc. is a daily occurance in the places they come from and thanks to our elected officials and greedy businesses, they have invited these criminals into our midst.</p>

			<p>Lots of you were probably wondering about Leo Berman&rsquo;s ethnicity.  His name is Jewish as could be but his biography says he&rsquo;s Episcopalian:<br>
https://www.house.state.tx.us/members/dist6/bio/berman.htm</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t if he converted from Judaism or what.  I&rsquo;d vote for him, regardless.</p>

			<p>Good for Berman.  Yet the 14th amendment itself should be challenged as it was never properly ratified.  </p>
<p>Texas came in under treaty and that treaty promised to protect the border.  Since the US has failed in that Texas should declare the treaty void and go back to republic status. </p>
<p>While they are at it they should reclaim their original territory which amounts to half of NM, CO and a narrow strip of WY. In addition,they should reclaim the several counties they were forced to give up to OK.  And, further take back the part of EL Paso that the old sick in the head LBJ gave to Mexico. </p>
<p>Then there is the matter of the off shore oil lands stolen by the Feds back in the 1950s. </p>
<p>Yes for sure the federal dollars flowing in to the new republic would stop, but what price freedom?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m currently living in Texas, where I am now a minority, just as whites are in California.  Texas, with it&rsquo;s ever increasing Mexican population would not secede.  I wish that were possible.  It is only a matter of time before Texas starts voting with communist democrats.  It is occupied territory.  My home state of Oklahoma, on the other hand is the new battle line.  Although John McCain is thouroughly worthless for most things and especially for protecting us from illegal invasion, my home state has the distinctions of having voted for him (which means against the Obamination) by the highest percentage in the union, and was the only state without a single county voting for Obama.  Makes me proud as hell to be an Oklahoman!</p>

			<p>Twenty years ago the situation the above article implies would have been considered wild satire, as would the idea that the federal government would deliberately fail to enforce its own laws and leave our borders wide open.</p>
<p>Now we take the absurdity of that reality and the absurdity of our federal &#8220;government&#8221; as routine.</p>

			<p>Burmen should be awarded the medal of honor.  No issue threatens national security more than millions of immigrants who come here to change USA into their open borders breeding grounds.  USA appears to have been overcome with foreign born voters who tipped the scales in favor of Obama.  If the immigration laws had been enforced (as Reagan already established) this would not be the case.  USA now officially endorses illegal immigrations and state sponsored citizenship for all who come.  Is it any wonder states with the highest deficits and subprime defaults are all major points of entry and endorse entitlements for illegals.  <br>
This one issue is destroying USA. Federal policy is against Federal immigration laws that have been on the books over 200 hundred years! These laws were established to PROTECT US from foreign interests. Berman is uniting citizens and the one unifier natural born citizenship; parents of illegals have no claims upon our soil.  V</p>

			<p>His bills which are all phrased very well should become the standard for such legislation in every state in the US.  If he is successful in Texas alone, it will be good for Texas, but the masses of illegals will simply move on as they have done in the past to other &#8220;more welcoming&#8221; states.  While I praise him for his taking a stance in the state capitol, we desperately need his equivalent in the congress.  Only by changing the rules of the game on a national level will this problem which is so destructive be solved (something that is clearly possible, but requires only the will of &#8220;our&#8221; legislators to be successful).</p>
