<h1>CDA Says Islam Can Promote Democracy</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Netherlands Info Services (GM's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands), November 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Christian democrats (CDA) conclude in a study that Islam can be a source for fostering democracy. The sharia, or Koran-inspired law, can play a role in this process, the study compiled by Arie Oostlander finds.</p>
<p>Oostlander strongly opposes what is known as the secularisation premise, which claims that democratic development benefits from reduced religious involvement. &#8220;I take a strong stand against the idea that Islam is incompatible with democracy. This premise plays into the hands of extremist groups. Islam can provide a basis for promoting the democratic constitutional state,&#8221; Christian newspaper Nederlands Dagblad quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Oostlander was director of the scientific bureau of the CDA between 1975 and 1989. Jan Peter Balkenende, the present CDA leader and Prime Minister, once called him his &lsquo;spiritual father&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The West, Oostlander maintained, must try to link up with religious groups in Muslim countries that are open to democratic developments. He said he did not wish to be &#8220;naïve&#8221; about this, because there are also extremist groups that do not eschew violence. But space can be created for the sharia. &#8220;Not everything stated in the sharia is bad. We should be prepared to take part in discussion about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen (CDA) took receipt of the study. &#8220;Religious leaders can play a positive role in reforms in a country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But religion is not the only factor that decides someone&rsquo;s identity. It should never be impossible for someone to participate in a discussion because of their convictions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where the sharia is concerned, Verhagen maintained that &#8220;there must never be any excuse for stoning women to death&#8221; or killing homosexuals. But this does not alter the fact that people may allow themselves to be inspired by their religious convictions in shaping society, the minister declared. And this can be manifested in legislation in one way or another, he added.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Except for stoning women and killing homosexuals, sharia is pretty good for democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cutting off hands and feet for minor thefts helps a lot too, as does torturing and sacrificing innocent little animals. <br>

			<p>   Let me count the number of Muslim democracies in the world  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  - on one hand . Islam and Liberty are the antithesis of each other . They cannot co-exist for long in the same space .</p>

			<p>&ldquo;But religion is not the only factor that decides someone&rsquo;s identity. &#8220;</p>
<p>Anyone who would make such a statement is not really familiar with the beliefs or lifestyle of a true Muslim.  For a true, practicing Muslim, this statement is totally false.  From the moment they wake until they sleep, the one purpose of a true Muslim is to serve Allah.  This is reinforced by praying 5 times a day.  Their entire identity is defined by their religion, most are rather fanatic about it, there are 1.3 Billion of them, and your government is importing them into your country as fast as possible.  </p>

			<p>Mad, crazy and mad. A year ago a 19 year old Nederlander/Dutch kid enters the computer lab at the university looking for help on a project. I ask him what he is doing here in South Africa and he tells me that he is doing voluntary help in the black squatter camps; he touches his chest saying &#8220;internationalist duty&#8221;. I immediately phantom a story of my own, I tell him that I to do internationalist duty, I belong to an organization that help Muslims, Algerians, Moroccans and Turks settle in the Netherlands so that your people can also enjoy the multiracial, multicultural utopia that we now enjoy. He stormed out of the lab in anger, I wonder why??? The Netherlands where at the forefront in the fight against apartheid. I am desperately trying to feel sympathy for them.</p>

			<p>If Sharia is so wonderful&hellip; let those who claim to LOVE it&hellip; move to the Muslim country of their choice. Although their cure for thievery, promptly applied with a sharp instrument soon after conviction, makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that the Muslim faith is out for world conquest. Regardless of whether or not its adherents concede that point. You&rsquo;re a either a devout Muslim or a heretic deserving death.</p>

Turkey. You must differentiate those countries in the Middle East. Turkey have never been an Islamist country and won&rsquo;t be in the future.<br>
In fact, she isn&rsquo;t a middle east country either despite some American classifications.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be rude to Christians (sort of), but idiots such as this vacant-headed &#8216;do-gooder&rsquo; who is obviously riddled with guilt or just plain stupid, are a massive problem in any &#8216;western&rsquo; country. Of course you all know that.<br>
Not only are they mad about multiculturalism and &#8216;tolerance&rsquo;, they will never fail to defend the rights of the nastiest criminal, especially if they&rsquo;re from a &#8216;marginalised&rsquo; group. The big problem is that these people are always in some sort of position of power and as a result of that, we can&rsquo;t even have a good laugh at them.</p>

			<p>Honor killing is a classic example of Islamic democracy.  The judgmental family members always outnumber the victim(s) and majority rule leads to the death of a daughter or sister over some idiotic trifle only a medieval psychotic believes warrants imposing the death sentence upon an innocent family member&hellip;</p>

			<p>There was a really good article written by FREEDOM HOUSE back in 2002 called the THE DEMOCRACY GAP. It showed how non-democracy was essentially a muslim phenomenon. 76% of non-Muslim countries in the world were democracies while an even larger 77% of Muslim countries were not. Is your country predominately muslim? Odds are better then three in four it is not free. Is a country not majority-muslim? Odds are better then three in four it is a democracy. Even most of the remaining 23% of muslim countries were only partially-free at best. In the ARAB-MUSLIM core no countries were democracies. Saudi Arabia - the geographical heart of islam- is the least free country on earth. They didn&rsquo;t even ban slavery until 1962.</p>
