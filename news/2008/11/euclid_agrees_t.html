			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Krouse, Plain Dealer, November 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Euclid city schools will not fight the U.S. Department of Justice over claims about the discriminatory way in which the board is elected.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is expected to file suit against the school board, perhaps as early as today. The lawsuit will include an agreement that the election procedure violates election law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s involvement in Euclid politics goes back to 2003 when it began investigating why no blacks had won election to Euclid&rsquo;s City Council or school board since 1995, despite a growing African-American population in the city.</p>
<p>After a two-day trial in 2007, U.S. District Judge Kathleen O&rsquo;Malley forced changes to the system for electing Euclid&rsquo;s council. Federal prosecutors argued the process prevented blacks from forming a bloc behind a candidate of their choice.</p>
<p>As a result, O&rsquo;Malley abolished Euclid&rsquo;s system of four ward seats and four at-large seats. The city now has eight wards. Earlier this year, Kandace Jones, an African-American, was elected to council.</p>
<p>The Euclid school board has five members, all elected to at-large seats. In odd numbered years, either three or two seats are up for election for four-year terms. The top vote-getters win the seats.</p>
<p>Smith, the school attorney, said one remedy could be switching from an at-large system to a ward system.<br/>

		<p>If there aren&rsquo;t enough blacks to get a black board member in one ward out of four, then there won&rsquo;t be enough blacks in the whole district to get one black at-large board member, save the help of white liberal voters.</p>

		<p>More gerrymandering to accommodate a black minority.  The Justice Department appears to be an agent for the NAACP and our Constitution drafted exclusively for their benefit.</p>

		<p>C&rsquo;mon!  Who needs elections anyway?  After all, it&rsquo;s just our centuries old democratic process so it can be dumped at will these days.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t everyone know the part of the constitution that guarantees equality of outcomes?  </p>
<p>Me neither.  </p>

		<p>Well, this is typical. If a black person can&rsquo;t win election then the system has to be tinkered with to accomodate black supremacy. And if you notice in this country, it has gotten to be where whites cannot &#8220;represent&#8221; blacks, only blacks can represent blacks, and of course, blacks can represent whites. But, whites can only represent whites, another nod to black supremacy. </p>

		<p>I wonder if Whites lose faith in Blacks after having seen them lead -up close and personal.  I have seen Black leadership in the form of teachers I have had over the years and it only bolsters my opinion that any sane White would see them as the incompetents most actually are.  </p>

		<p>Now, it is only a matter of time before the whole city and the whole board are both black.</p>
<p>White Americans better understand that the U.S. Justice Department is not their friend.  I guarantee that Obama will choose a black to run the joint during his time in office.<br/>

		<p>The way Euclid is going this won&rsquo;t matter in 20 years. Euclid is one of those Cleveland suburbs built after WWII, and the black invasion gained strength in the 90&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s now about 50% black, with the schools more than that. Heartbreaking.</p>

The excuses and proposed solutions never end.</p>
<p>&#8216;We should be on the board because our students are the minority and they need a voice.&rsquo; &#8216;We should be on the board because our students are the majority and we know what works for them&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Pick the reason. Any reason. With blacks, there&rsquo;s always an excuse.</p>
<p>If blacks believe their kids are being shorted by a white majority board, they have no idea how a black majority board is going to mess things up beyond their wildest dreams.</p>
<p>The excuses, reasons, demands, etc are just beginning and endless. And the kicker is, nothing they do will improve black student performance. It&rsquo;s all a dog and pony show.</p>
<p>On a related matter, I was listening to local black talk radio and the &#8216;angry black man&rsquo; host was interviewing a school administrator. The host made the point that blacks needed black teachers because blacks supposedly know how to teach blacks. The guest said that few blacks want to become teachers because of their own school experience with blacks. Apparently, even blacks don&rsquo;t want to be teachers because they know how black behave in the classroom and they see blacks are unteachable. It makes sense that there is always a small pool of black teachers who are in high demand and why black administrators and principles receive outrageous salaries and perks.</p>
<p>Nice job if you can get it and if you&rsquo;re black, you can.<br/>

		<p>If your city is 50% blak you should be thinking more about getting out than who gets elected to the school board. Any city with that large a blak population is doomed to crime, violence, corruption, and eventually an incompetent government, and no white person should have to endure that. we are better than that. Do not let the blaks pull you down.</p>

		<p>Get over it white people!!! Our time has passed. We are destined to be ruled by Mongolians and as has already happened by mongrels.The majority of us have no place to hide and nobody to blame but ourselves.<br/>
     When we tried to rectify the inequalities that prevented blacks from the equal protection of the law. We allowed unscrupulous men to hijack a noble venture and twist it to a hustle for power and tax payer money. Blacks have suffered most of all.75% of them are born out of wed lock and we lock them up at 5 times the rate of even trash whites.<br/>
     Euclid will join Compton, East St Louis, Camden, and about 100 other former decent suburbs into a hip hop world of screaming sirens, drive by shootings, gang violence and a smaller and smaller percentage of whites becomming more isolated and terrorized.<br/>
     If you live in places like Euclid form defense forces among your own. The police are not on your side.Follow the Biblical mandate of Lex Talionis, &#8221; Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,blood for blood.&#8221; If all you hold dear is doomed to ruin and degradation, then  go down fighting like men and not cowering sheep.<br/>

		<p>This is a continuation of what the justice department did when the PC number of blacks were not being elected to city councils in many parts of the nation. Under threats of federal force, these cities went to gerrymandered districts that would guarantee black victories. Oddly enough, these tend to be the same cities where the whites have left and are now drowning in incompetence. I once interviewed for a job in the Cleveland area and Euclid was mentioned as a place to avoid like the plague. </p>

		<p>Euclid has been in decline for the past two decades, like a lot of the inner-ring suburbs of Cleveland.  The once grand houses and shops are decaying and the lakefront has been reduced to high rise apartments and a park system where no one ventures alone or near dusk.  To see the aimless black youth shuffling along the roadways with their 3 sizes too big droopy-drawers and their &#8220;gangsta&rsquo;&#8221; hoodies, you&rsquo;d think you were travelling through the projects.  My white friends who still work in the area keep themselves armed at all times.  </p>

		<p>When will Whites have Enough?<br/>
These people are the Nation&rsquo;s Minority, and we are allowing them to take a dump on us.<br/>
The Whites that voted for this &#8216;joke&rsquo; will need to Awaken.<br/>
They will sooner or later.  Like say, when their check does not show up on the 1st of the month.<br/>
But, their AA neighbors check came on time, and got an increase.<br/>
Blacks love to get positions in City, County, State, Government.<br/>
They like to have the big offices and long desks.  They like to be in control.<br/>
But, that&rsquo;s because we have allowed them to get away with being mouthy and pushy.<br/>
We have allowed Government to hand them our money on a silver platter.<br/>
Now, the new Government is a Black persons Utopia, All Demogrants in Control, out to please and appease them!<br/>
Not until it becomes &#8216;personal&rsquo; will Whites realize what they have done to themselves.<br/>
Until then, those of us that are Awake and Aware, stay prepared, and keep readying ourselves for what is coming.<br/>
