<h1><a href="https://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=992946">Ottawa University Boots Cystic Fibrosis From Charity Drive</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>National Post, November 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Carleton University Students&rsquo; Association has voted to drop a cystic fibrosis charity as the beneficiary of its annual Shinearama fundraiser, supporting a motion that argued the disease is not &#8220;inclusive&#8221; enough.</p>
<p>Cystic fibrosis &#8220;has been recently revealed to only affect white people, and primarily men&#8221; said the motion read Monday night to student councillors, who voted almost unanimously in favour of it.</p>
<p>Every year near the beginning of fall classes, during university orientation for new arrivals, students fan out across the city and seek donations from passersby. According to the motion, &#8220;all orientees and volunteers should feel like their fundraising efforts will serve their (sic) diverse communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nick Bergamini, a third-year journalism student on the student council, said he was the only elected councillor present to vote against the motion. The decision is an example of campus political correctness gone too far, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re not doctors. They&rsquo;re playing politics with this,&#8221; said Mr. Bergamini. &#8220;I think they see this, in their own twisted way, as a win for diversity. I see it as a loss for people with cystic fibrosis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Shinearama fundraiser is carried out by students at about 65 colleges and universities across Canada. It has raised money for the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for almost 50 years and Carleton has been participating for at least 25.</p>
<p>During orientation week this year, Carleton students, who have raised about $1-million over the years, raised about $20,000, said foundation chief executive Cathleen Morrison, who was surprised and dismayed by the student association decision.</p>
<p>The rationale for dropping cystic fibrosis as the beneficiary is not correct, she said. CF is diagnosed just as often among girls as boys, although the health of girls deteriorates more rapidly, she said. It is commonly considered an illness that affects Caucasians, but that includes people from the Middle East, South America, North Africa and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>&#8221; &lsquo;Caucasian&rsquo; as we understand it isn&rsquo;t just white people,&#8221; said Ms. Morrison. &#8220;It includes people with a whole rainbow of skins.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the councillors who voted in favour of switching the charity said Monday night that the information provided to the panel prior to the vote was factually incorrect, and he will be seeking support from other members to hold an emergency meeting to reconsider their decision. &#8220;After seeing all the reaction today, I definitely think it should be revisited and reconsidered,&#8221; said Michael Monks, who represents Carleton&rsquo;s business students for the student council.</p>
<p>Student association president Brittany Smyth said the motion came about because the association has been contemplating rotating the beneficiary of Shinearama to different charities each year instead of giving the money to a single charity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s about people wanting to do something different,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The motion was forwarded by Donnie Northrup, who represents science students. Mr. Northrup did not respond to a request for an interview.</p>
<p>The preamble to the motion is Mr. Northrup&rsquo;s explanation for why he supports the motion, based on what he learned as an orientation-week volunteer, said Ms. Smyth.</p>
<p>In making a decision, it was not the preamble but the declaration itself that matters, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The preliminary is the councillor&rsquo;s own motivations and ideas,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Most discussion revolved around rotating the charity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bergamini said he doesn&rsquo;t believe the decision represents the opinion of most students.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re playing racial politics with something that is supposed to bring people together &mdash; a charity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ms. Morrison, who hopes to get a chance to set the record straight with the student association, said students raise a healthy chunk of the approximately $16-million raised each year to support cystic fibrosis research.</p>
<p>The median life expectancy for a person with CF in Canada is just over 37 years, about twice what it was two decades ago. The money for research has helped produce a lot of international &#8220;firsts&#8221; including isolating the CF gene and carrying out the first double-lung transplant for a CF patient.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, public reaction to the student association decision has been swift, from those who denounced the decision as political correctness to those who facetiously mused about what would qualify as an &#8220;inclusive&#8221; disease. Others wondered if the student association decision would affect alumni donations to the university.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reasoning behind this is totally ridiculous. Eventually cystic fibrosis is a fatal disease. I wouldn&rsquo;t wish it on anyone,&#8221; said Marie Lunney, a Carleton graduate who has worked as a foundation volunteer. &#8220;If I had a choice between donating to CF or Carleton, I&rsquo;d donate to CF.&#8221;</p>

											<p>
							<i>Katie Daubs, Ottawa Citizen, November 26, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Donnie Northrup, the Carleton University student who wrote the controversial preamble to cancel Shinerama because it&rsquo;s &#8220;not inclusive enough&#8221; said he&rsquo;s sorry he misused the term caucasian but stands by the motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s good to have people willing to take a stand in student politics, and I&rsquo;ve admitted I&rsquo;ve made a mistake. But I do believe in spreading the wealth, so to speak, as charities go,&#8221; he said, adding that local charities stand to benefit from the decision.</p>
<p>The preamble he wrote last weekend, that cystic fibrosis &#8220;has been revealed recently to only affect white people, and primarily men&#8221; accompanied a motion to drop cystic fibrosis as the sole beneficiary charity of Carleton University Student Association&rsquo;s frosh week.</p>
<p>It passed almost unanimously.</p>
<p>In a letter to students, Carleton University president Roseann O&rsquo;Reilly Runte noted the motion contained concerning and inappropriate language.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that Carleton students are fine young scholars who wish to be responsible and considerate.  I am sure that they did not intend to offend by the preamble to their motion, but I am also sure that they now understand the effects of that language,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>Mr. Northrup said &#8220;not a lot of thought&#8221; went into the wording, and didn&rsquo;t realize caucasian applied to other groups that weren&rsquo;t necessarily white.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m among term papers and assignments &mdash; it was a slip up. I should have researched it further,&#8221; said the fourth year integrated science student, adding that writing is not something he&rsquo;s focusing his degree on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not saying it&rsquo;s not a good enough charity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Northrup said the whole issue has been blown out of proportion, and the backlash has been &#8220;fairly unkind.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has received hate email and random Facebook messages.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am currently not able to live happily,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said there is talk of rewording the motion to make the whereas clause more general, to say that &#8220;no single charity is diverse enough to meet the needs of the student body&#8221; and it is therefore necessary to offer different charities the chance.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning, CUSA president Brittany Smyth acknowledged CUSA council will revisit the motion because there is not an appetite to change charities at Carleton.</p>
<p>A press release also apologized for the negative attention the university had received.</p>
<p>Nick Bergamini, a third-year journalism student on student council who voted against the motion said there will be a protest Thursday at 12 p.m., in Mackenzie Field, between the Unicentre and the Mackenzie buildings.</p>
<p>The protest is organized by himself and other individuals involved in Shinerama in the past who want the charity reinstated.</p>
<p>Mr. Bergamini said the intent of the protest is to call for an apology from everyone who voted in favour of the motion.<br>

			<p>Earlier this year, a nurse posted here at AR that she was receiving indication that, in the years ahead, and because of racial diversity and equality, combined with many specious studies that blacks and Hispanics were victims of health care discrimination, that the mainstream health care system would engage in a concerted and sub rosa effort to deny health care to white patients.</p>
<p>This story from Ottawa might be the first indication that she wasn&rsquo;t paranoid.</p>

			<p>As a Canadian, I can help explain to my friends on here that Carlton is pretty much at the bottom of the pile of Canadian Universities in terms of admissions standards and overall academic rigor.</p>
<p>This story   &mdash;   and the so-called reasoning of those who supported the insulting and obnoxious motion in question   &mdash;   just illustrates the point.</p>

			<p>OMG&hellip;I can&rsquo;t believe what I&rsquo;m reading! Why don&rsquo;t they also exclude Tay-Sachs disease and sickle cell anemia? Those diseases affect only certain ethnicities and are also not &#8220;inclusive.&#8221;</p>

			<p>White men are expendable? What is this message? We need to include not exclude sick people. I am all for balance and equality in treatment but to single out a disease to ignore because it effects mostly white men??? I am speechless.</p>

<p>Oh, absolutely. After all, the more whites who die of CF and other diseases, the more non-whites and therefore, the more &#8220;diversity&#8221; we&rsquo;ll have. (&#8220;Diversity&#8221; has always meant preventing an excess of whites.)</p>
<p>This, coupled with the pathetic story yesterday of whites changing the rules of organ donation so that fewer whites receive them (even though they make the highest percentage of donations in the first place) means that whites are bound and determined to make themselves the minority not only through immigration and low birth rates, but by actively killing themselves off! </p>
<p>The degree to which whites are willing to grovel, humiliate and even to destroy themselves (in order to make themselves look good and high-minded to their peers) is truly sickening. It has gone beyond merely putting themselves down publicly to actively plotting against themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page_Custom.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=3506008&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=35&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=ottawa&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=35&amp;B1=Custom" rel="nofollow">Judging by these demographic figures</a>, Ottawa, the capital city of Canada is comprised of the vast majority population of 627,000 white people.</p>
<p>Essentially, it wouldn&rsquo;t be difficult for white men and white women to simply REFUSE any requests for donations to this anti-white campaign. </p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t really blame the students in this case because universities are no longer mandated to teach, but more to <i>indoctrinate</i> their young minds with the usual Marxist dogma. So a hard dose of reality could set them back on their own feet when potential white donors turn their backs and walk away. That would be an &#8220;education&#8221; in itself.</p>

			<p>I am surprised that I am no longer surprised. But it no longer ourages or sickens me, all it does is reinforce my belief that white males are under attack from all sides. Until the rest of the white population wakes up this will continue. But I am confident we will wake up, but not so confident that we will be able to do much as the demagraphics are starting to become insurmountable.</p>

			<p>I have stopped giving donations to several groups over the years because their positions slanted more and more towards minority groups at the expense of whites. I am 60 years old and was always very charitable and willing to give to almost anyone or any group in need. At this point, I will not give one cent to any group without knowing how and where the money will be spent. White people need to take care of white people first and foremost. If there is anything left over after that, you can choose to do with it as you will. </p>

			<p>Nowadays, leftists look back on past eras and chide the persons of those times for their &#8216;bigoted&rsquo; behavior, such as white-only immigration policies, emphasis on families, and pride in western culture. I predict that one day, historians will look back on our era and shake their heads at our rampant bigotry. They will point out that unfairness is unfairness, regardless of who it&rsquo;s directed against. And political correctness will be reviled for the closed-minded (i.e., liberals), sexist (i.e., against men), racist (i.e., against whites), and heterophobic (no explanation required) doctrine that it is.</p>

<p>He has received hate email and random Facebook messages.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am currently not able to live happily,&rsquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, we already know this is an abjectly feckless and wretched idiot; however, the issue of the backlash against him being described as &#8220;fairly unkind,&#8221; demonstrates that there really are no words in the English language to adequately describe just how hopelessly stupid he is. </p>
<p>Why do you think they call it a backlash Comrade Northrup, because it is meant to make you &#8220;live happily?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, what is to be expected from someone so neutered and debased in his thinking, that he denounces cystic fibrosis as not being &#8220;inclusive&#8221; enough to warrant charity to its victims?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

I was watching Barbara Walters interview Obama tonight. He believes people like us are going to be even more marginalized. </p>

<p>I knew an African American girl who actually had a disease like that - one that whites are much more likely to get, multiple sclerosis. She was kind-of mad about it, in a way. If it weren&rsquo;t for white folks, if she didn&rsquo;t have any white blood, she wouldn&rsquo;t have had the disease. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why she mentioned this to me. I am a white guy, and not a white girl after all. </p>
<p>I guess when they say we need to celebrate all of our heritage, they are really being quite specific about it.<br>

			<p>What kind of ideology is it that does not care about the most creative, most intelligent, most charitable class of people on the planet, namely White men? And why? BECAUSE THEY EXCEL.</p>
<p>When the White men are knocked off, the White women are next. Then, who? Why, the most intelligent and creative of whoever is left, that&rsquo;s who.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t be Orientals. Liberalism is as foreign to them as &hellip; Christianity?</p>
<p>Why must we lift up them who do not deserve or appreciate it?<br>
Why are we held hostage by their need? You see the thanks we get. As other posters have said, nix the charities, or at least investigate them very carefully. </p>

			<p>Canada again. Some strange stories coming down from up north. The mob attacking Jared Taylor at Halifax. The eavesdropping thought police at Queen&rsquo;s University. </p>
<p>Now this out of Ottowa. Maybe the northern latitude with the long winters has caused the rampant PC brain infection to mutate into very distinct strain in the white people up there. These innocent&rsquo;s lack of contact with minorities has kept them from building up immunity to the disease. A little first-hand knowledge can innoculate even the most mediocre and malleable of minds. </p>
<p>The bottom line is self-destructive multiculturalism is the real sickness that afflicts only white people.</p>

How about using some of that self-glorification of creativity and intelligence to find a way out of this mess. The problem with comments like those is that while they may boost self-esteem, it also increases complacency and the sense that things will work out, when there&rsquo;s really no reason to believe so. A superior race would not have gotten into this situation. And definitely, a superior race would, by now, have had a plan to extricate itself if it did. </p>

We raise money for Tay-Sachs, even thought it strikes almost exclusively Jews. That&rsquo;s because we raise money to save people  &mdash;   not tribes.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Even by the insane standards of the PC culture of Canada, and most acutly it&rsquo;s institutions of higher &#8220;learning&#8221; (indoctrination), this decision by the Carlton University Student&rsquo;s Association is madness. Since when are deseases &#8220;inclusive&#8221;? Are we now to apply the dictates of racial Marxism to deseases? The only &#8220;inclusive&#8221; desease I see here is the soul sickness of modern White drones. This insanity has been induced by a generation of evil anti-White, anti-male propaganda. That deseases that affect the target group (White males) of this propaganda are now subject to defunding should scare even the thickest of White people. This thin edge of the wedge is one more step toward factories that turn White men from carbon-based life forms into carbon ash. It&rsquo;s only a matter of degree.</p>

			<p>Fluxcapacitor, I was not trying to boost anyone&rsquo;s self-esteem.</p>
<p>If they need me to boost it, then, by definition, it is not SELF-esteem. Self-esteem is an inside job.</p>
<p>Increases complacency? How so? The wiser a person is, the less he underestimates his enemy. White people have surely underestimated the enemy. White people are so arrogant that they think everyone loves them and is grateful to them.</p>
<p>While the White race has intelligence, does it have WISDOM? Wisdom comes from living with self-awareness and having personal standards. I do not see much self-awareness, much less wisdom, among anyone, these days. </p>
<p>I said that Whites were intelligent, creative and charitable  &mdash;  more so, GENERALLY SPEAKING, than any race on earth. That is not saying that they are superior, in terms of survival, and, perhaps, some other categories. Survival takes wisdom, AND THE GOAL OF SURVIVING. No one is more foolish then the one who does not know he is under attack.</p>
<p>Liberals are, generally speaking, intelligent, creative and charitable. Many of them work in the creative media. I do not think they are wise, nor do I think they are putting their creativity to good use. But they are intelligent, quick, and creative. My personal opinion is that a racially-aware, moral liberal is pure gold, much like the &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; liberals.</p>
<p>Maybe because of my slightly &#8220;mongrel&#8221; genetics I never quite fit into the White race, and was ostracized by many. But I consider myself White, and I think I have a valid vantage point from which to view my fellow Whites, even though they usually do not know what I am talking about, or where I am coming from, especially the non-Celts (read &#8220;Anglo-Saxon&#8221;). </p>

<p><i>One of the councillors who voted in favour of switching the charity said Monday night that the information provided to the panel prior to the vote was factually incorrect, and he will be seeking support from other members to hold an emergency meeting to reconsider their decision. &ldquo;After seeing all the reaction today, I definitely think it should be revisited and reconsidered,&rdquo;<br>

That&rsquo;s alright. Don&rsquo;t worry! I took no offense. You were not unkind.

<p>I thought my comment pretty innocent, also. I suspect certain individuals are pulling my leg, as I have also pulled other peoples&rsquo; legs on this website.</p>
<p>I think my unique vantage point is this: I have never fit in anywhere, but yet, even though I have a college degree (BA), I have worked in warehouses and had some pretty rough manual labor jobs. I got to experience some very different ways of responding to our culture. I have been despised by Whites and supported by Blacks, and vice-versa.  People think that I am on their side, and then find out that I do not have a side.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, I was given a liberal arts education, with all that entails, and on the other hand, I was not given any breaks by my own people, and ended up working with people who had a very first hand experience of working-class (even lower-class) life!</p>
<p>Even today, with my own business, I still frequently do manual labor. I have even poured concrete with the &#8220;brothers&#8221; during the day, then gone to a Brahm&rsquo;s piano concerto at night. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t start playing any violins for me! I am not complaining!<br>
It has been a trip! I am not claiming any superiority, just a vantage point that may be unique.</p>

			<p>No wonder Canada will be another &#8216;California&rsquo; within my lifetime. Can&rsquo;t the good decent minorities residing in the Great White North of Canada treat European Canadians with respect? This is stupid. </p>
<p>If I were to study abroad in Canada, I should definitely cross Carleton University for my lists of schools. </p>

			<p>In doing some reading around the &#8216;Net (God help me), I&rsquo;ve found where some people feel that all this fuss about what the Carleton Scholars did has been blown out of proportion greatly by what has been perceived as a &#8220;vast right-wing conspiracy.&#8221; Stated another way, we conservatives are finding fault where we shouldn&rsquo;t be finding fault, or we&rsquo;re racist, or we&rsquo;re &#8220;haters.&#8221; Sound familiar?  I happen to be one of those who feels that idiotic antics along the lines of abolishing help to victims of CF, for no good reason whatsoever, is evidence of a vast left-wing conspiracy. </p>
<p>I was also more than a little annoyed by Mr. Northrup&rsquo;s imbecilic claim that he isn&rsquo;t focusing on polishing up his writing because he&rsquo;s a science major. What is integrated science?  A catch-all major for scientific losers? Rocket science by another name?  Astrophysics?  Biochemistry?  Nuclear physics?  Chemistry?  Molecular biology?  Computer science and engineering?  Even scientists need to be able to write and to express themselves well. Let&rsquo;s hope he doesn&rsquo;t change his mind and go into medicine.  Sadly, he&rsquo;s not alone in being a victim of the great dumbing-down of the world.  I do hope I haven&rsquo;t been &#8220;unfairly unkind,&#8221; and I hope he&rsquo;ll be able to live happily.</p>

			<p>As a white man I am absolutely insulted by Mr Northrups self centered stupidity. But as a father of a child with cystic fibrosis I must deal with this disease everyday of my life. Mr. Northrup, you may &#8220;GO TO HELL&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why dont we hear much about sickle cell anymore anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>First sickle cell is disappearing. It takes 2 parents with the sickle gene.  Then there is only a 25 percent chance that they will have a child with the gene.</p>
<p>That child will have to find a partner with the gene to produce a sickle cell child.  But there is only a 25 percent chance that they actually produce a child with a sickle gene.</p>
<p>Because it needs 2 parents with the gene and the low chances of those parents producing a child with the gene, sickle cell is dying out.</p>
<p>Every generation there are fewer and fewer sickle cell children being born.</p>
<p>Sickle cell is not curable.  But, like diabetes and other diseases, it is very managable with pain pills, adequate hydration, avoidance of too much physical extertion and prompt medical treatment when necessary.</p>
