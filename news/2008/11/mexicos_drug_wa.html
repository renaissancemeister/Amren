<p>As Mexican nationals and Mexican Americans begin to plan their holidays, many say they are choosing not to make the annual trek home to visit relatives. While some are dissuaded by the worsening economy, others are avoiding travel to Mexico because they fear the rampant kidnappings, killings and shootouts.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert late last month warning U.S. citizens to take precautions and to be aware of the &#8220;increasingly violent fight for control of narcotics trafficking routes,&#8221; especially in the cities of Tijuana, Chihuahua and Ciudad Juarez.</p>
<p>Business at Transportes Intercalifornias, which runs about 15 buses a day from Los Angeles to the border towns of Tijuana and Mexicali, is already down from last year, said dispatcher Robert Bahine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexicana Airlines has seen about a 4% drop from last year in bookings from Mexicans traveling home to visit friends and relatives, said Jorge Goytortua, vice president of sales for U.S. and Canada. But Goytortua attributed the decline to the economy, saying that many regular customers work in affected industries.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s consul general in Los Angeles, Juan Gutierrez Gonzalez, also said he believes the economy is having a greater effect on travel than the drug wars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But that is not the case with Yvonne Mariajimenez, a public interest attorney in Los Angeles. Mariajimenez said she has the money to travel home to see her relatives for Christmas but she is afraid to do so.</p>
<p>Mariajimenez, 50, said she has traveled to Mexico dozens of times in the last decade and usually spends her visits driving elderly relatives to neighboring towns to see one another. Her aunt told her that if she went this year, she shouldn&rsquo;t rent a car or drive around the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more I talked to her, I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t just my safety that she was concerned about, but it was hers as well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If they see a foreigner, the assumption is that the person has money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Mariajimenez was born and raised in the U.S., she said Mexico is a part of her heritage and she is devastated by the increasing violence. She said she had hopes of retiring in Mexico, which she remembers as a relaxing and beautiful country, but worries now that may not be possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;The corruption of drug trafficking has really permeated these towns,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am not sure the innocence of that time will come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the concerns, many are undeterred.</p>
<p>More than 1 million Mexicans returned home last winter, according to the Mexican government, which runs a program called Welcome Home Paisano aimed at easing their passage, teaching them their rights and reducing corruption by public officials. National coordinator Itzel Ortiz Zaragoza said that based on summer travel, she expects about the same number this winter.</p>
<p>And Mexico&rsquo;s tourism board said the number of travelers to the country actually increased by about 5% in the first seven months of this year, compared with the same period last year. Officials said they don&rsquo;t expect a decline during the holidays.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Christmas season is the most important holiday for Hispanics in general (including Mexican Americans) to travel home to visit their families,&#8221; Jorge Gamboa Patron, director of the board for Los Angeles, said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;If in fact there is a decline in travel during the upcoming holiday season, it will probably be because of the U.S. economic situation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Believe me, we&rsquo;re seeing a situation that is getting worse every month, and the it will continue to accelerate even faster than did the gang chaos during Prohibition.</p>
<p>Drugs, however, represent far more money and can provide much more power than booze did years ago.  </p>
<p>The cartels have moved into the US, and are now beginning to control the areas along the border with huge amounts of money that is far in excess of what many governments have at their disposals.</p>
<p>Psblo Escobar came within an inch of taking control of the entire country of Columbia and would have had he not attempted to move too quickly before securing the loyalty of some of the more influential politicians and businessmen he didn&rsquo;t yet have on his payroll.  His finances rivaled those of the Columbian government.  He had the funds to pay a standing army.</p>
<p>All that drug wealth and power now belongs to the Mexican cartels, and an investigator would be hard-pressed to find politicians, army brass, and police not on their payrolls.</p>
<p>The tightened US security at the border has enraged the drugmeisters, and they have made they&rsquo;re move in this chess game by concentrating on acquiring power on the US side, rather than attempting to bring Calderon&rsquo;s close circle of people over to their side, because to do so would have few benefits to easing the force against them by US authorities, which is what they must have in order to keep their traffic flowing.</p>
<p>Right now the cartels are employing US Special Forces trained  Zetas who are acting as their military wing.  They want to improve their political position by putting more US officials in the towns and cities on their payyroll until they have enough control to keep their drug delivery corriders in the US open for business.</p>
<p>Many in Congress have always voted to keep the southern border unguarded.  Have the drug czars gotten as far as the US Congress in their influence?</p>

<p>This has been a problem for the last 50 years. It is dangerous for a Mexican living in the United States to drive in Mexico because the police constantly stop and rob them.  So do the bandits.</p>

		<p>This has to be the BEST EXCUSE for illegal immigration heard to date. One can only suppose the Mexicans are jealous of the foul reputation for crime and corruption enjoyed by those enlightened African nations and want to try to outdo them on that score.</p>

		<p>What will president Obama do when tens of millions of mexicans seek political asylum in the US as that country falls to narco-terrorists.</p>
<p>How long after that happens will the US fall to those same narco-terrorists?</p>
<p>If you had asked me 6 months ago, I would have said that the US had an immigration problem but, eventually, we would get our acts together to fix things.</p>
<p>Today, I no longer think that.  And I&rsquo;m starting to make real plans to have an exit strategy for if the US becomes non-viable as a place to live anymore.</p>

		<p>Have no fear, President Obama has a solution to Mexico&rsquo;s crime problem: he&rsquo;s going to give visas to all the gangbangers south of the border! </p>
<p>That way, Mexico will be a much safer place to visit after the thugs move here.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. I thought Mexico was such a wonderful, law abiding place! I thought it was only once they got into the United States that Mexicans became corrupted by our lax, immoral society and started turning to crime. Oh, now I get it! Mexico is obviously being corrupted by the evil influence of their neighbors to the North! But then, why would the attorney in Los Angeles feel safer here than in Mexico? I&rsquo;m going to have to give this some more thought&hellip;</p>

		<p>In all fairness, part of what is fuelling this is the continued use of illegal recerational drugs by Americans who ought to know better, and the blanket prohibition against them by a US government that should know better.  Marijuana, the number-one cash crop in the US, should be legalized immediately, but cocaine and methamphetamines would remain more serious social, health and crime problems.  I see no way their legalization would be of net benefit, these hard drugs tend to turn users into amoral slimebags.</p>
<p>If our molecular biologists were given suitable funding, perhaps they could bioengineer a blight that would kill off Latin America&rsquo;s coca crop.  Such a (natural) blight has unfortunately already devastated their rubber plantations, which is why most of the world&rsquo;s rubber comes from southeast Asia, even though the plant was originally native to South America.</p>

		<p>Those of you who already want to blame Obama for the Mexican border problems reveal your lack of analytical skills given he hasn&rsquo;t even taken office yet.  Nor will necessarily be  as bad as Jorge Bush given illegal immigration hits blacks harder than any other group of us. Wait until he actual screws up rather than wearing your bias on your sleeve. In  other words your posts sounds like a lot of whining rather than anything insightful or useful.</p>

<p>Well, that would certainly reduce crime in Mexico and make it safer for travel down there. It would then, however, require running the gauntlet of crime expansion up here just to GET to the border.</p>

<p>Until the mex government started this program about 5 years ago, the Mex police would wait till they were about 10 miles into Mexico, then steal their cars, their money, the Christmas presents, sleeping bags and other equipment and sometimes rape the women.</p>
<p>Finally the gas station, restaurant and motel owners complained that their customers were afraid to cross the border.  So the government finally made an attempt to control the thieving, rapacious police.</p>
<p>Living in S. California I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of horror stories about how dangerous it is for Mexicans going back to visit.  If they are indian rather than white looking they are always treated worse, even though the police are heavily indian.</p>

		<p>According to the state department, 30 percent of all deaths of Americans in foreign countries occur in Mexico.</p>
<p>Even considering that Mexico is a big vacation destination for Americans that is an astonishing percentage.</p>
<p>Part of the explanation is the incompetence and lack of equipment of the Mexican ambulance service.  People who would make it to the hospital in most countries die because Mexican ambulances do not have ambu bags or other oxygen equipment.</p>

		<p>I can understand the teenagers and college kids. They&rsquo;d vacation in hell if allowed to do so. What has always made me wonder, is their parents. Do they really think it is alright for their children to vacation in Mexico? Do they ever read the newspapers?  Are they all on drugs or is it just a case of not caring?</p>
