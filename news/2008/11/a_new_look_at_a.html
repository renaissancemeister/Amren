				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kimberly Sanfeliz, Boston Globe, November 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new survey by the University of Massachusetts at Boston&rsquo;s Institute for Asian American Studies attempts to fill what the authors say is a gaping hole in the research on immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The institute&rsquo;s study, &#8220;Interest and Action: Findings from a Survey of Asian American Attitudes on Immigrants, Immigration, and Activism,&#8221; found that 80 percent of the 412 Asian-Americans surveyed pay either a great deal of attention or some attention to immigration issues.</p>
<p>It also found that 58 percent said they were very sympathetic or somewhat sympathetic to the Latino community&rsquo;s stance on immigration issues, and 52 percent support a legalization process for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>The survey also asked respondents about their likelihood of participating in activities supporting greater rights for immigrants. While 33 percent said they were very likely to sign a petition, only about 9 percent said they were very likely to work with others in an organization, or to participate in a march or demonstration.</p>

			<p>It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that 52 percent of Asians support legalization. 1)Many Asians are here illegally. 2) Many have grandparents and parents that are cheating the government 3) Many are anti-white. 4)They have no connection to the history of this nation, as millions of whties do. Exactly where is the surprise on their attitude concerning U.S. laws and the importance of those laws? Again, from personal experience, I exclude most of the Japanese from these comments. </p>

<p>Let me get this straight&hellip;you think Asian males voted for Obama because McCain is white plus the association that whites are trying to &#8220;take their women&#8221;. I seriously doubt that. Asians have typically voted Democrat and would have done so regardless. If you are in fact one of those white guys who chases Asian women, then your taunt/comment is a sign of insecurity.   </p>

			<p>Regardless of the higher socio-economic status of Asians they still appear to have resentment against the European-Americans who allowed them to come here in the first place.  </p>
<p>This means that no matter what we do for any other racial / or ethnic group they will desire either a parasitical or domineering relationship with us, and will side with any other group against us.  Remember the political theorists who predicted the Hispanics would vote for McCain because of their rivalry with the blacks???  That theory, along with Karl Rove&rsquo;s fantasies about the hispanics being natural Republicans have both been tossed into the ash heap of history.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to be smart. One needs to be loyal in order to be considered a desired type of an immigrant.</p>
<p>Also, my personal experience with small lanscaping/gardening businesses was that the owner was almost always Asian and the workers were illegal Mexicans. So, if they make good money of illegals, they are not likely to oppose the illegal &#8220;immigration&#8221;.<br>

			<p>Of course the Asians support amnesty for illegal aliens - duh!</p>
<p>Deepa Iyer, executive director of South Asian American Leaders of Tomorrow in Takoma Park, Md. on Indians in US; &#8220;as many as 400,000 are undocumented&#8221;</p>
<p>http://escapefromindia.wordpress.com/2006/10/28/23-million-people-of-indian-ancestry-us-census-data/</p>
<p>Thus, if there are approximately 2.3 million Indians in the US and 400,000 of them are &#8220;undocumented&#8221; - about 1/6 of Indians in the US are illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Even more ominous. Asian Indians, not  Mexicans, are now the fastest growing segment of illegal aliens in the US.</p>

<p>Also, the San Francisco Chronicle reports 1.5 million illegal Chinese and Filipinos.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/05/18/MNG7JITSJA1.DTL&amp;hw=Filipinos%2BFor%2BAffirmative%" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/05/18/MNG7JITSJA1.DTL&hw;=Filipinos%2BFor%2BAffirmative%</a></p>
<p>Add it all up and it&rsquo;s easy to see why they want amnesty - so that chain migration can kick in and they can dispossess &#8220;evil whitey&#8221;.</p>
<p>Asians don&rsquo;t like whites in general. True, east Asian women are attracted to white men. But, in general, these people harbor deep rooted historical resentments against us - especially the Chinese who drone on endlessly about their &#8220;humiliation&#8221; at the hands of the west. </p>

<p>How is that any different from white men complaining about blacks with white women? On AR and other similar forums I see it all the time. East Asians are a very small minority in America, but something is even more wrong when people in the majority culture have the same problem.   </p>

			<p>Just one more addition to my above post if I may. 5)Many Asians are sympathetic to illegal aliens because they use and abuse(underpay) them in their &#8220;restaurants&#8221;. Some people will interpret these assertions as arising from &#8220;hate&#8221;, etc. Not at all. I like to think of myself as a kind of observer,a kind of philosopher on life issues. The truth is, I hold no particular grudges towards the vast majority of mankind, but instead tend to judge my own and myself, more severly, because we should know better, considering all the wonderful things that have been handed down to us, and that we abuse and take for granted. </p>

			<p>I have never ever complained that Asian women and some white men date.  I do notice it indeed, but I have never ever complained that some white men date Asian women.  That is mostly because, the Asian women who date white men are, more often than not, less than attractive ones among the Asian women.  </p>
<p>And secondly, AmRen is about preserving the rights and respecting the heritage of white people in North America and around the world.  Then why do quite a few of you white men sound so proud that you are dating Asian women?  whereas you get so upset if white women ever date or marry outside the race?   Aren&rsquo;t you contradicting yourself?  I do not mean to argue with you.  I will always read and post on AmRen.  I do not mind a few Asian women date outside their races, (there are enough Asian women for all Asian men to choose from) but I just wonder why you contradict yourself.  </p>

<p>I have had long association with Asian people, and I have never been subject, to or sensed, any resentment from them. This association includes Chinese, Philippinos, Vietnamese, Thais, Cambodians and Laotians (to include the Yard and Hmuong from the mountains) Asian women do seem to like American men in particular though, but still, I have never heard any resentful remark from men. Of course, that could be due to my sparkling personality.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought it&rsquo;s a fallacy that conservatives refer to Asians as a &#8220;model minority&#8221;. I went to a high school that was about 10-20% Asian (mostly Chinese and Korean), and the students I knew there were hardly worth emulating. They were very often of lower-income families and were big into the whole rap music/&#8221;thug life&#8221; scene. Some were even in gangs and carried weapons to class, a far cry from the stereotype of the &#8220;nerd&#8221; Asian who plays RPG computer games like &#8220;World of Warcraft&#8221; and watches anime.</p>
<p>The fact that they resent whitey and support Democrats is not surprising.</p>

			<p>most people are ethnocentric to some degree and asians are certainly no exception. but im reluctant to dismiss these results as evidence of prejudice. since asians tend to be relatively recent immigrants themselves, its not surprising they would feel some sympathy for hispanic immigration. however, asians tend to have a little more class and i can see them becoming quickly annoyed with those who don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>You are correct. As Courtney and some other posters have made clear, a number of White men on this board (not all) are outright hypocrites when it ocmes to interracial dating.they feel it is okay for them, but go hysterical when White females or non-white men do so.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve always been under the impression that some white men have a preference for E. Asian women.  I&rsquo;ve seen Asian women overrepresented in porn but not the general media which I take to mean they have a strong appeal over a segment of whites but the preference is not held by the more general population.  </p>

			<p>Canada was founded on three pillars: English, French, and aboriginals.</p>
<p>Later, the tension between French and English encouraged Canadian politicians to put forward a solution: bring in immigrants of varied nationalities, creeds, and races, in order to restructure the country into a fractured &#8216;mosaic&rsquo;.  The idea was that with many &#8216;special interest groups&rsquo; no one group could dominate the others. They called it &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This has another name: divide and conquer.  The founding whites are now fighting to preserve their place, against immigrants who care nothing for the future of whites on this continent.</p>

			<p>What type of white nationalist site is this where whites gloat about their purported ability to get cheap Asian mail order brides?<br>
I thought miscegenation was a big no no - or does that only apply to white women with non-white men?<br>

			<p>Good point, Korean guy. I think that first-generation Asian women may feel attracted to white men as a kind of status symbol (I have previously been in a brief relationship with a Taiwanese girl myself), but second or third-generation Asian women tend to stick with their own.</p>
<p>&#8216;&hellip;the Asian women who date white men are, more often than not, less than attractive ones among the Asian women.&rsquo; This is exactly how I feel regarding white women / black men, which is the main reason why I&rsquo;m none too fussed by it. Also, the white women who date black men usually hail from the lower echelons of society.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t mind white women dating Asian men as I have great respect for East Asian peoples. I&rsquo;m glad you post on AmRen, and please don&rsquo;t be put off by some of the comments on this page! Asians have as much to fear in the long run from the demographic growth of the Third World as whites.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Asians have typically voted Democrat and would have done so regardless.&#8221; Kevka</p>
<p> I agree with that. Asian covers both East Asians and South Asians. I would say both groups support the Democratic Party more than whites. However, they don&rsquo;t vote Democratic in numbers as great as blacks or Hispanics. </p>
<p>I doubt that East Asians vote Democratic because white men are stealing their women. However, this &#8220;stealing&#8221; is limited to East Asian women as most white men don&rsquo;t&rsquo; find Hindi women attractive. </p>
<p>I must disagree with Korean guy about white men dating mostly unattractive East Asian women. I&rsquo;ve seen some very attractive East Asian women with white men. Nevertheless, Asian women are  selected sometimes not because they&rsquo;re more attractive, but because the&rsquo;re more traditional. Of course, I personally prefer that whites stay within their own race, but I have no strong feelings against mixed East Asian and white couples.<br>

<p>You are in denial. The fact is that Asian women who date White jus are just as attractve as those who do not.</p>
<p>I have also seen some drop dead gorgeous White women with Black and Latino men as well.</p>

			<p><i>Of course, I personally prefer that whites stay within their own race, but I have no strong feelings against mixed East Asian and white couples.</i></p>
<p>Nor does it seem one particularly well known white nationalist who when interviewing a very high ranking member of France&rsquo;s National Front who is married to a Japanese woman, not only voiced no objection to this, but used this as evidence that whites do not hate non-whites!   </p>
<p>The hypocrisy of white nationalists knows no bounds. Any white woman with a black man would be persona-non-grata, but white men with asian women? That&rsquo;s just fine. Obviously lust trumps genetic perservation for many so-called white patriots.</p>

			<p>On AmRen, of course anyone is allowed to disagree with me in civil manners.  Just because someone disagrees with me that does not mean I am disrespected or I should stop posting on AmRen.  Disrespecting and disagreeing are completely different from each other.  Of course we are all entitled to have different opinions as long as we have valid supports, and there are a few attractive East Asian women with white men as well.  I said &#8220;more often than not&#8221; not &#8220;always&#8221;.  And even though the majority of the white women in relationships with black men are extremely overweight, there can be skinny white women with black men.  But unfortunately we only remember the minority of the cases.  Likely that&rsquo;s why some white men say &#8220;white women are the causes of the miscegenation and they are destroying white races!!&#8221; when that is not even close to the reality.  Majority of white women are together with white women.  And the white men should compare how many of white men themselves get involved in miscegenation with how many of white women do.  </p>
<p>I remember reading, &#8220;our society will always contain a little bit of everything&#8221; and it feels like that&rsquo;s the reality.  Even if interracial dating is still very rare in Toronto, and very likely always will be, there will also always be interracial couples of all races, including white male-black female couples, Asian female-black male couples, and so on.  There actually was a rather attractive Chinese girl dating a black boy when I was in highschool, and the picture of them holding each other appeared on the yearbook.  And I am a Christian and Christianity strongly opposes homosexuality, there will, unfortunately, always be a few people who are sexually attracted to people of the same gender.  Speaking of which, a friend just gave me the address ot this page that displays pictures of an interesting newlywed couple (don&rsquo;t worry, they are heterosexual) <a href="http://www.sherdog.net/forums/f7/i-got-married-last-weekend-pics-877461/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sherdog.net/forums/f7/i-got-married-last-weekend-pics-877461/</a></p>
<p>At the moment I have different priorities than dating.  I must take care of some unfinished business (one of Homer Simpson&rsquo;s lines) And even when I do start dating, race would not be that much of a factor.  I am not going to go for a particular race.  I will have very little, if any, restrictions.  Of course white women are very beautiful and they have wonderful personalities, but that does not mean by any means &#8220;my date must be a white woman!! I will go for an white woman only!!&#8221;  </p>

			<p>I find it odd that a group of people who left their heritage and homeland (Asians) behind encourages the infiltration of the land they chose to desecrate.  Here in the US we have laws concerning immigration, and anybody who breaks the law should be penalized. The US should put tariffs on all Mexican products/services to help fund the deportation and illegal activities these illegal immigrants perform. If a company gets caught hiring illegal immigrants they should bare all expenses associated with the deportation of these people back to their home land and all related costs, fines and suits outstanding. The immigrants should be stripped of any material goods other then the cloths on their backs. I like to think of this as a form of US tough love&hellip;..</p>

			<p>  Years ago, when the old Ice Bandit had a full head of hair and a testosterone level bordering on overdose, I wasn&rsquo;t above pursuing asian women. But it was terminal horniness, rather than racial disloyalty, that inspired that pursuit. For those who remember the 1970s can recall that the insidious hysteria known as radical feminism was just taking hold in the workplace and in academe. And there seem to be, at least in the case of caucasian women, a decline in that indefinable, but very real and desireable, trait known as femininity. Flirtatious skirts and dresses gave way to androgynous pant suits. Sweet feminine persuasion was replaced with &#8220;I am woman hear me roar.&#8221; But at my university, the one group of women not so influenced were the japanese and chinese women. My guess it is those traits of gender and personality, so attractive to so many men, are the reason many caucasian men persue asian women. </p>

			<p>I am an American of Korean background who is against massive immigration from Third World countries. I, for, one do not support affirmative action that discriminates against the hard-working decent European Americans. They are not our enemies. In fact, the real enemies are the anti-white marxists of all races who should be treated for treasons against America. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Asians residing in this great nation of ours failed to see the truth regarding massive immigration from Third World nations and how it will ultimately hurt their standard of living in the long-term </p>
<p>It is my hope all Americans, regardless of color, will rise up against the Far-Left agitators and make America our home again. I hope to God the cult of multiculturalism will burn in hell. </p>
<p>BTW, I surely hope Asians and other non-whites view White Americans as people too. They should have White history month in November. Besides, they have the right to perserve their hertiage just as anybody else. </p>

<p>Ridiculous.  Hmong, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Indians and almost every other group under this umbrella are beneficiaries of AA.  Many of these groups rely heavily on welfare.  They also employ a great deal of illegal labor (many are relatives) in their ethnic restaurants, dry cleaners and nail salons.      </p>

<p>Really? So why is it that at our country&rsquo;s elite schools, a larger percentage of students are Asians than the percentage of Asians in the general population? At MIT, for example, they comprise about a third of the population. If MIT were to adopt a quota system which forces the proportions of students to reflect the general population, Asians would be the first to go. In California, the educational establishment looks with great alarm at the gaping disparity between Asian kids and students of other minorities (with whites stuck somewhere in the middle). The minority interest groups have their knives out for the Asians, and yet the Asians keep voting Democratic. Talk about handing the axe to the executioner. What suckers.</p>

			<p>Is this because Asians feel so benevolent towards other minorities, or is it that their hatred for whites is so profound as to overshadow any other consideration?</p>
<p>My answer:  It is more like half and half. It all depends on where Asians live and varies from person-to-person. I am making an educated assumption they are focusing too much on living the &#8216;American Dream&rsquo; and less on complaining. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is racism towards European Americans by Asian Americans. Racism to any groups, including Europeans, is just wrong. My stance is we should be one people, one flag, one culture, and one nation. Otherwise, we will be just another South Africa. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to brag, but if the vast majority of minorities think like me, then our borders will be shut down tomorrow and massive immigration will only be a thing of the past. However, that&rsquo;s not the case. </p>
<p>What should we do? We should get out to vote for a candidate that will put America and Americans First. Spread the word out to your friends in Myspace, Facebook, and various other websites to get our message across on immigration, radical islam, multiculturalism and issues that pertains to our lives. </p>
<p>There must be a way to get our young Americans to wake up and take our country back. Otherwise, sayonara America. </p>

			<p>&#8220;New America Media&#8221; is a liberal &#8220;news&#8221; organization that has been cited by AmRen in the past, specifically this story informing us that 40 to 44 percent of illegal alien students in the University of California system are Asian. </p>
<p>http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=dadc30476b263a037ac68c65f32704c6</p>
<p>&#8220;New America media&#8221; also reports that there are 230,000 ILLEGAL ALIEN Koreans in the USA as of January 2007;</p>
<p>http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=5a920a0eb9bc5730dd8cc6916f09dd40</p>
<p>The US Census reports 1.2 million Koreans in the USA as of 2004 - page 4, table 2;</p>
<p><a href="/prod/2007pubs/acs-05.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/acs-05.pdf</a></p>
<p>Thus, the percentage of Koreans who are illegal aliens is about 1/6 - same as Asian Indians.</p>
<p>Factor in the fact that the Boosh Administration has added South Korea to the list of countries that can enter the USA visa free, and it&rsquo;s clear that the USA will see huge spikes in ILLEGAL ALIEN Koreans.</p>
<p>IMO, this is not as ominous as Asian Indians or Mexicans given that Korea has &#8220;negative population growth&#8221;;</p>
<p>http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/country/ksportal.html</p>
<p>While India&rsquo;s population is literally exploding;</p>
<p>http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/country/inportal.html</p>
<p>As is Mexico&rsquo;s;</p>
<p>http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/country/mxportal.html</p>
<p>However, it does explain why Asians would support amnesty for ILLEGAL ALIENS.</p>
<p>Asians, in general, don&rsquo;t get affirmative action, when applying to college  because they are not an &#8220;under-represented minority&#8221;. However, since they are &#8220;under-represented&#8221; in government jobs - they do get affirmative action when applying to work for the government. This is why so many of the new workers at the post office are Asian. Jobs like  police, firefighter, clerks, etc would also be required to use affirmative action hiring policies for which &#8220;underrepresented&#8221; Asians would qualify for.</p>
<p>This San Francisco based organization is called; Chinese for Affirmative Action</p>
<p><a href="http://www.caasf.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.caasf.org/</a></p>
<p>About half of the so called Vietnamese in the USA are actually &#8220;ethnic Chinese&#8221;. Among the first orders of business for the victorious Vietnamese communists was the EXPULSION of ALL &#8220;ethnic Chinese&#8221; from Vietnam - even though most had lived there generations. These people usually call themselves &#8220;Vietnamese Chinese&#8221;. </p>
<p>Thus, there are really 2 ethnic groups among the Vietnamese in the USA  - &#8220;ethnic Chinese&#8221; and ethnic Vietnamese. Due to the IQ differential between the 2, the ethnic Chinese have thrived in America while the ethnic Vietnamese remain mired in poverty, gangs, and welfare. To be sure, these are characterizations of the 2 distinct &#8220;Vietnamese&#8221; ethnic groups in the aggregate.</p>
<p>My 4 year long sojourn in the SF Bay Area exposed me more Asians that I would have liked.</p>
<p>That said;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are a &#8220;model minority&#8221; or not. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if, on average, they have higher IQs than we do - even if we have more geniuses (and morons) because we have a more widely distributed IQ bell curve. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are legal or illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The ONLY thing that matters is that they are not white! Allowing hordes of Asians, or ANY other non white race, into OUR living space is a threat to the ONLY thing that matters; the survival of the white race!</p>
<p>The race that gave the world just about every single equation, formula, or theorem in a  modern math text. Just about every idea in a modern physics, chemistry or medical textbook as well.</p>

			<p> I have been condemned on more than one occasion for not being strongly against East Asian and white intermixture. In my lifetime, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of knowing many highly cultured and intelligent Korean and Chinese people. Some have been loyal and compassionate friends. I do support a limited number of highly educated East Asian immigrants coming into the United States every year, but I&rsquo;m against huge migrations of peoples (including East Asians) to already developed countries like the United States.  Rational but limited immigration during times of economic growth is within the traditions of the United States. Basically, I support the United States remaining a predominately white country because that was how the country was founded and progressed. Our history, culture, language as well as economic well being are all inter-related to the continuation of the majority white race in America. </p>

<p>One thing I don&rsquo;t get&hellip; if America is supposed to be so full of racism and hatred of Asiatics&hellip; why do they persist in coming to a country where they&rsquo;re not wanted? Come to think of it, Asiatic countries, we find, are just as racist as they accuse us Whites of being. But get any Asian to admit anything like that.</p>

			<p>Chinese government, contrary to what happens in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia, wants a more homogenous country. They don&rsquo;t want minority-majority regions. Although 90% of Chinese population is Han (an ethnic group), they have regions with high concentration of minorities like Tibet, Muslim Uyghur and Inner Mongolia. That is the reason why Chinese authorities are encouraging Han migration to those regions.</p>

We have legitamite ties to Mexico and must handle illegal invasions from them much differently than with east asians or East Indians, Pakistanis or other Asian people.  Illegal Asians need to be kicked out of America just like illegal Africans or even illegal Europeans.  If we are not a sovereign country anymore then let&rsquo;s get on with the obvious next phase of post-America.</p>

			<p>Sardonicus, I&rsquo;ve been in the same position on these boards many times. People accuse me of being pro-Asian, traitor etc&hellip; I prefer the US to be a mainly white country with some influx from compatible and civilized people from the far East as well as necessary immigration from Europe and other white populations. The mainland chinese are a little squirrely but I believe that they too will gradually change now that they are more concerned with their economy than the communist rhetoric. I had very favorable interactions with chinese, koreans, and japanese people and usually I am not scared of them jacking, killing, or mugging me. They are polite and hard workers in my workplace. I&rsquo;ve had mostly negative experiences with middle easterners, hispanic, black, and other groups since I&rsquo;ve been around various groups of people.</p>

<p>UGH, when did I ever rant and/or decry racism?  I never ever did.  To be honest I rarely experienced racism since I arrived in Canada.  And even if I did experience racism, I sure would have found a way to work around it.  </p>
<p>I think any non-white including East Asians screaming &#8220;racism in North America in the hands of whites&#8221; is a very pathetic excuse.  If I work hard, I can do anything I want and I can have anything I want.  </p>

<p>You are right. I know many white Americans and Europeans who are so interested in other cultures that spend their youth traveling to Africa, Asia and Latin America as volunteers for humanitary work. They are so naive that think they can change the world. Undeveloped nations will never progress if their governments and politicians continue with their corruption and inefficacy. Their dictators, presidents and authorities use their power to get rich, they don&rsquo;t care if their own people are dying with epidemics and famines.<br>
P.S: An anecdote. Some months ago thieves stole money, digital cameras and other electronic devices from a group of volunteers working in a Latin American country. That&rsquo;s what they receive for being so charitable.</p>

<p> Sorry Steve, I&rsquo;m neither of the two. I said I support &#8220;limited&#8221; immigration from East Asian, not the huge numbers we&rsquo;ve been getting since 1965. By the way, it is unrealistic to think that we could ever go back to the National Origins Act of the nineteen twenties. A few thousand more East Asians in a country of three hundred million is hardly the &#8220;dispossession&#8221; the Hispanics are bringing in their untold millions.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta be kidding.  When it comes to immigration, America is a soft touch.  They&rsquo;ve let millions of Asians in the country just in the past decade.  If they didn&rsquo;t allow permanent residency it&rsquo;s probably because you were at the back of the queu on their quotas for that year.  All anybody has to do is fly into Los Angeles and scatter into the population.  Don&rsquo;t want to be on the radar?  No problem.  Fly into Mexico and walk across the border.  Many areas have nothing more than a rusty barbed wire fence separating the US from Mexico.  Permanent residency?  What do you need that for?  It won&rsquo;t stop you from finding employment.  Social Security numbers and driver&rsquo;s licenses can be bought on many street corners.  Not looking for work?  No problem.  Squirt out a baby on US soil and you automatically qualify for welfare.  They&rsquo;ll even pay for the hospitalization.  No questions asked.  I&rsquo;m going to stop now because I&rsquo;m starting to get angry.</p>

			<p>Well big guy (or ma&rsquo;am) I am sorry to hear that you are angry, </p>
<p>But if immigration to USA is such a piece of cake as you say, then why are there illegal immigrants in USA?  Why can&rsquo;t they just legally immigrate to USA if it is so easy.  If your words are true that immigration to USA is so easy even for the least deserving, the poorest, least educated non-white people from the third world countries around the world, then why aren&rsquo;t they just legally immigrating to USA?  Legally immigrating to USA and becoming a legal citizen to USA will grant tremendous rights as opposed to the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of being an illegal citizen in USA.  Being a legal immigrant also removes any chance of being deported.  the &#8220;benefit&#8221; that illegal immigrants do not have to pay &#8220;taxes&#8221;?  haha but it is also impossible for illegal immigrants to find jobs that pay even close to what legal citizens in USA get paid.  </p>
<p>and the fake IDs?  I can tell a fake ID in ten seconds.  I can tell a counterfeit currency in two seconds.  Bouncers in front of clubs in Toronto can tell if an ID is fake in two to three seconds.  (but some bouncers pretend as if they can&rsquo;t tell if it is a fake one because the clubs have to make profit any way they can) the trick is the ID card is not the only thing the bouncers look at when they check the validity of the ID.  </p>
<p>And the comment almost at top of this page that I did not pay much attention to, </p>
<p>&#8220;Asian american men truly do not like how white males &ldquo;take&rdquo; their women. They overwhelmingly voted for Obama and I&rsquo;m not surprised they support illegal immigrants&rsquo; rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>I will be honest with you, maybe it is because I am seriously considering a career in IT, I did appreciate it when Obama said he will concentrate on reducing IT outsourcing to India (there are many white people who are in that industry as well, and suffering from outsourcing to India as well) but it is extremely ridiculous to say &#8220;Asian men are jealous of white men that a few Asian women are dating white men, therefore Asian men voted for Obama and Asian men support illegal immigration.&#8221; </p>
<p>and secondly, I fail to see any logical connection between &#8220;some Asian women are dating white men&#8221; and &#8220;Asian men support illegal immigration and illegal immigrants&rsquo; rights&#8221;  That is like, saying, &#8220;White men enjoy visiting the zoo and playing baseball therefore white men went to buy some chocolate&#8221;.  I fail to see any logical connection.  </p>
<p>Why would Asian men in North America support illegal immigration and illegal immigrants&rsquo; rights?  (if illegal immigrants have any rights)  There is no reason for us to.  Please be assured, Asian men especially East Asian men namely Japanese men and Korean men have absolutely zero reason to support illegal immigration or the illegal immigrants&rsquo; rights.  It is the opposite in reality!! we all know illegal immigrants are sometimes dangerous and commit crimes, (well, one of the illegal immigrants&rsquo; ways to make living) and nobody wants to live in a dangerous society especially during times like nowadays when authorities are too busy making excuses that they cannot do anything, because they are so scared of being labeled as racists.  </p>
<p>and I will gladly repeat it one more time, Asian men do know there are a few white men who are dating Asian women, but we Asian men are not jealous.  If there is any Asian guy or white guy or black guy who says &#8220;some of our girls are dating men outside our race!!&#8221; that is nothing more than a pathetic excuse for not being able to find a date.  and let me assure you, I did talk about &#8220;there are some Asian women dating outside the race&#8221; with other Asian men of different nationalities countless times, but I have never met any Asian man who moaned or complained.  On top of that, interracial dating is still rare.  Toronto is one of the most multi-ethnic cities in the world and more than 95% of people of all races are still dating within their respective races.  If you consider &#8220;dating people with similar skin tones but different nationalities&#8221; is an interracial dating, it would be around 90%.  I notice a lot of Russians date whites of British ancestries in Canada. If you can&rsquo;t believe me, you are welcome to visit Toronto or just ask anyone who lives or has visited Toronto in the past.  The bottom line is interracial dating is still rare everywhere in this world.  </p>
<p>That is also the biggest reason why Asian men do not have to be jealous that some white men and Asian women date each other.  It does not affect the Asian boys&rsquo; chances of getting a date.  If there is anyone who says &#8220;I can&rsquo;t get a date because our girls are dating outside our race&#8221; what do we call that?  a lame excuse.  </p>
<p>on another note, I just received a message from my prof that she will give me a four day extension for my final project.  That is a big relief :)</p>

			<p>Korean guy.  Good for your parents paying taxes.  We in California see something entirely different.  First, there are the constant slave labor scandals in asian food processing, garment sweatshops and sex slave industries.</p>
<p>Then there is the total tax evasion practiced by asians in their crooked businesses.  Even the anti white, anti american pro illegal immigrant Los Angeles Times ran a story that just the one country of Los Angeles alone was owed one billion dollars per year from ASAIN businesses that failed to pay sales taxes.</p>
<p>Asian convenience store owners are notorious for food stamp fraud.  People constantly ask, &#8220;Why do asians set up convenience stores in such dangerous ghetto neighborhoods?  The answer is food stamp fraud.  The asians buy the food stamps from the blacks at 40 cents to the dollar then the federal government reimubrses the crooked asain business 100 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>The food stamp fraud store owners in every state in the US are overwhelmingly asian and indian.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that asian employers prefer their own clansmen.  An asian businessman will pay a smuggler $30,000 to bring over some 2nd cousins brother in law rather than hiring someone in the country.  Of course the 2nd cousins brother in law is bound to work for the rest of his life to pay off the $30,000 plus 400 percent interest.</p>
<p>Sorry Korean guy, it is the truth.</p>
<p>The other problem is the inherent racism of American employers and our governments affirmative action policies.  It is almost impossible for a white american male to get into either medical or nursing school anymore, so the percentage of white male american physicians dwindles every year.  I work at a medical school and the white american male representation is only about 5 percent.  The rest are white females and various asian, indian and other foreigners.</p>
<p>White american males are still allowed to study computers, IT and engineering, but it is impossible for them to find jobs due to the anti white racism of both employers and our government.</p>

<p>It will depend on the country.  Where is &#8220;here&#8221;?  Who is the illegal here?  The mother or the father?  The law is getting tougher and tougher for illegals.  </p>
