<h1>Gangs Could Spoil Obama&rsquo;s Party</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sky News (UK), Nov. 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gang violence and looting could ruin Barack Obama&rsquo;s party in Chicago if he wins the US election. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to God I&rsquo;m wrong, but there are 7,000 known gang members in Chicago and they aren&rsquo;t going to miss an opportunity like this,&rdquo; says Paul Huebl, a former police officer in the city and now a respected author and crime blogger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police officers will be gravely outnumbered and outgunned and placed in danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no way to protect businesses. Parents and kids are going to think they&rsquo;re going to a party and they&rsquo;re going to end up getting hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than a million people are said to be planning to celebrate the expected election of the first black President of the United States.</p>
<p>Just 65,000 will be allowed inside a security cordon to see Obama on stage inside the city&rsquo;s scenic Grant Park, which borders the shores of Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>But hundreds of thousands more are expected in the vicinity, and there are fears that whether Obama wins or loses, looting and gun violence will flare.</p>
<p>The Chicago Police Department has cancelled all days off for officers on Election Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone will be working 12-hour shifts,&rdquo; said police spokeswoman Monique Bond.</p>
<p>However, Obama&rsquo;s top strategist, David Axelrod, says: &ldquo;We expect a good, supportive crowd, and we expect it to be a happy occasion. Whatever the result, we don&rsquo;t expect trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That might be wishful thinking, given Chicago&rsquo;s propensity for violence.</p>
<p>Last summer, Grant Park hosted the &lsquo;Taste of Chicago&rsquo; food festival. Four were shot, one fatally.</p>
<p>In 1992, hundreds of police officers were hurt when riots flared during sporting celebrations for the Chicago Bulls.</p>
<p>A year later, when the Bulls triumphed again, there were more riots &mdash; this time four people were killed.</p>
<p>There was another riot in Grant Park when pop band Sly and the Family Stone cancelled a concert.</p>
<p>And a casual glimpse at the city&rsquo;s crime log for the last 48 hours makes grim reading: three people shot and killed, one a boy aged 16; one man stabbed to death; a woman killed in a robbery; seven people leaving a nightclub injured in a drive-by shooting; police shoot and kill a man wielding a knife; three boys aged nine, 11 and 17 shot and injured in separate incidents.</p>
<p>Mayor Richard Daley has been criticised for failing to deter revellers from heading to the city centre without an event ticket, but he is hopeful the night will be peaceful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be surprising, there are going to be a lot of people who want to come down to celebrate, we hope it&rsquo;s a million or more, that&rsquo;s realistic. It&rsquo;s going to be wonderful,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But Kim Brehm, associate editor at the Southtown Star, said: &ldquo;Whether earned or not, Chicago is known as a rough-and-tumble kind of town where anything can happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given our history, I hope to God we get it right this time.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>I live in Chicago and Da Mayor is telling people to use public transportation to Grant Park.  Arrive in a bus leave in an ambulance is more like it.  This will be interesting to watch, from a distance of course.  </p>

			<p>Chicago is only one city they need to be worried about.  I venture that Detroit, Cincinnati, Cleveland and possibly Baltimore will see looting and rioting if he wins or loses.  Blacks have proven from the past, they don&rsquo;t need an excuse to riot.  They&rsquo;ll just make one up and the damages they will cause, is going to cost all of us.  Just another example of an Obama win.</p>

			<p>I was a history major in college in the late 1940&rsquo;s. When I studied the rise of the Nazis, one phrase always stayed with me. When they took power, one noted historian said, &#8221; The gutter comes to power.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll bet my house that the NAACP, ADL, ACLU, AJC, National Lawyers Guild Alan Dershowitz, Lynn Stewart, Len Weinglass etc are preparing lawsuits against the Chicago Police force if they dare touch a feral gangster intent on murder, rape and arson.</p>
<p>The media will of course blame the riot on &#8220;police over reaction&#8221;  and call for even more disfunctional, illiterate, overweight, affirmative action officers with criminal records to <br>
&#8220;assure the community&#8221; that the police are on the feral blacks side against evil whitey.</p>

			<p>Why is the word &ldquo;Gang&rdquo; in the title?<br>
It won&rsquo;t be gangs doing the killing, just blacks doing what blacks do.<br>
And what happens if Obama loses? <br>
Detroit&rsquo;s Devil&rsquo;s Night hits Chicago, Atlanta, Cleveland&hellip;<br>

			<p>Is there any doubt of violence?  The radio reported this morning there was a 10% increase in gun sales this month.  The talk show host tried to pawn it off as people rushing to buy guns just in case Obama gets elected and puts restrictions on them.  What&rsquo;s the hurry though?  Bush is still President till January so there&rsquo;s something more to it.  </p>

			<p>This will be one of the very rare times that lots of White diversity worshippers attend a massive function with non-White people.  For some it will be eye opening, for most it will change nothing and all non-White misbehavior will be excused as the fault of White racism.</p>
<p>One is inclined to wonder why they don&rsquo;t spend more time with non-Whites if they champion their cause so much.  Perhaps they fear power most of all and as long as Whites are in power they will hate them.  Under this line of thinking, a non-White is useful in disrupting the powerful Whites that rank and file Liberals wish they could become.</p>

<p>I have to give the Sky News people credit for subtly stating the obvious in a way. This being that blacks are totally base and prone to outbursts random mod violence, be they enraged or euphoric. To be frank, I think that there will be much more potential for anti-white violence by blacks should this absurd &#8220;transitional&#8221; symbol of multiculturalism win the election, simply because blacks will register this as a triumph over foolish &#8220;whitey&#8221; and that they have &#8220;overcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>History shows that whenever a black enters into a position of power, his/her fellow hooting and chirping &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; become excessively emboldened and given to: lawlessness, looting, murder, and rape. As Gedahlia Braun observed in his July 1998 article for AR, &#8220;South Africa Under Black Rule,Part I&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, blacks tend either to follow rules slavishly, not grasping the possibility of exceptions under any circumstances, or to simply flout the law. One might regard this as a typical manifestation of the apparent lack among Africans of the concept of gradation: something is either on or off, all or nothing; therefore, once they start breaking laws they tend to break them all. </p>
<p>I believe a similar change in black psychology has occurred in the United States. From 1969 to 1973 I lived in New Orleans, in a white neighborhood, though half a block away it was black. I could walk anywhere, night or day. By the mid-1980s, however, things had changed dramatically: Everyone had stories about black-on-white crime, and areas that had for years been white were being abandoned. What caused this turnaround? In the early 1980s, New Orleans got its first black mayor. My conjecture is that the increase in crime was disproportionately black-on-white, and was associated with decreasing fear and respect for whites brought on by access to political power: &#8216;What do we have to fear? We&rsquo;re as good as the white man! The mayor himself is black!&rsquo;&#8221;  (See the AR link below)</p>
<p><a href="/ar/1998/07/index.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/1998/07/index.html</a></p>
<p>In the end, no matter what happens tomorrow, blacks will be doing what they do best: destroying property and people on a grand scale!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve said this before and will repeat it again. I CARRY, and I do NOT intend to be a victim of Blacks. Whether because they&rsquo;re celebrating or p.o.&rsquo;d. They want my blood? The cost will prove to be substantially far higher than they&rsquo;d want.</p>
<p>I urge EVERY American to wake up out of his/her torpor. You can take a Black out of the jungle. But taking the jungle [mentality] out of the Black&hellip; is entirely a different matter.</p>

			<p>There are over 50,000 known gang members in the city of Chicago, and 14,000 cops (24/7); most of the gangbangers don&rsquo;t give a damn about who&rsquo;s president, they just want less law enforcement (or laws affecting them) and more crime opportunities. Something Obama will grant them. Regardless, there will probably be riots either way; it&rsquo;s been 40 years since we&rsquo;ve had a good &#8220;burn&#8221; on any part of the city, why not downtown? Good luck controlling any mob in the city of Chicago now; it&rsquo;s not like &#8216;68 where the cops were given cart blanche to control the hooligans, now the cops run and hide so they don&rsquo;t get sued. The citizens will have to protect there own neighborhoods (they will) but the &#8220;lakefront liberals&#8221; are on their own. Good luck.</p>

			<p>&#8220;That might be wishful thinking, given Chicago&rsquo;s propensity for violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chicago&#8221; does NOT have a propensity for violence, Blacks in Chicago have a propensity for violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;And a casual glimpse at the city&rsquo;s crime log for the last 48 hours makes grim reading: three people shot and killed, one a boy aged 16; one man stabbed to death; a woman killed in a robbery; seven people leaving a nightclub injured in a drive-by shooting; police shoot and kill a man wielding a knife; three boys aged nine, 11 and 17 shot and injured in separate incidents.&#8221;</p>
<p>And how many of these &#8220;incidents&#8221; involved or were caused by Blacks? Likely every single one. I&rsquo;m so sick of the news media not telling the truth. </p>

			<p>There are nearly 3,000,000 people in Chicago and one helluva lot more than 7,000 of them are gang members.  </p>
<p>In a city in which one can drive for miles without passing the residence of any Whites, tomorrow night figures to be a worst case scenario:</p>
<p>1)  Normal temps of 50 degrees will be exceeded by 20 degrees, thus bringing many of the worst &#8216;citizens&rsquo; of Chicago out of their houses late at night.</p>
<p>2)  The event will be held in the city&rsquo;s front yard which is a prime location filled with glitzy stores, expensive cars, and White liberals, all of them easy pickings for thugs and criminals.  </p>
<p>3)  A secondary site is being erected a block away for those who don&rsquo;t have tickets.  Want to bet that many in the secondary park will feel they are &#8216;entitled&rsquo; to be in the main place and will do whatever it takes to get in there? </p>
<p>I know of numerous Whites - none of whom would vote for Barry boy -  who plan to be nowhere near downtown Chicago tomorrow and Wednesday.  Let Obama&rsquo;s supporters feast on the libs who have sold us out.</p>

			<p>The City of Chicago must be run by racists; after all, when I left from work at 6 PM, I noticed that Chicago Streets and Sanitation crews were in the process of removing the garbage cans and recycling bins from the Downtown loop area. They must actually believe that African-Americans are highly prone to violence and mayhen when agitated by Black &#8220;leaders.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The fears these people express are absolutely rational, but the article is peppered with standard, dishonest euphemisms typical of journalism majors. &#8220;Gun violence?&#8221; Yes, guns often sneak out of the house and prowl the city streets. &#8220;Chicago&rsquo;s propensity for violence?&#8221; Yes, it&rsquo;s something to do with the occult powers of the longitudinal axis combined with the convergence of Violence Molecules at the corner of State and Madison; it&rsquo;s the city, you see, not any particular racial group within its boundaries. (Quiz: when my parents lived in Chicago&rsquo;s Logan Square in the 50s, was &#8220;Chicago&#8221; more or less violent than today? That&rsquo;s right.)</p>
<p>The fact is that when one controls for race, Chicago is not markedly more violent than small towns in Idaho. The problem, of course, is that it&rsquo;s no longer legal to control for race in Chicago, or anywhere else.</p>

			<p>Actually I am looking forward to the TV news after the results of the election are in. I hope chaos is the order of the night nation wide. I hope to see all black cities burning regardless of who wins! It will be exactly what blacks deserve and those jello spin white idiots that support NObama.</p>

			<p>I have always wanted to visit Chicago. It sounds like a place that, as far as crime and corruption goes, hasn&rsquo;t changed much since the days of Al Capone. The only involvment I&rsquo;ve ever had with the city is ordering VW parts as a young chap from a firm called J.C. Whitney and Co. Chicago Illinois. Oh, and being teenage friends with the two beautiful Meyer sisters from Chicago, Illinois, who constantly corrected me on how Illinois is pronounced. Sorry, just some old pleasant memories of a golden time in Southern California, long since gone.</p>

			<p>Out of towners may not realizw that the area near the Oboma-palloza is near Michigan avenue where all the best stores are. Hopefully they will be too busy looting to get near me. I am only three miles away. After the blacks start looting, the Hispanics will join in.<br>
   Blacks only commit half of the violent crimes. Hispanics (Mostly illegal) commit the rest.<br>
   I have finished cleaning my guns. I have been advising others that when the riots break out, seek shelter in a bookstore or library. These places are invisable to rioting blacks and hispanics.<br>
   When asked what we can do to stop this violence, my answer is the same: Get rid of the mayor and the alderman of the most violent wards.</p>

			<p>Let us be honest with ourselves and try not to see the worse on every account (though I am sympathetic to the reasoning).  Remember the Million Man March I think we came up with one incident of violence when some bow tied thug pushed down a white reporterette, and it was qucikly defused by blacks standing nearby.  Still as resident of the suburbs of Chicago I wouldn&rsquo;t go near Chicago tonite for the life of me, and a good many white liberals wouldn&rsquo;t either for the same reasons.</p>

			<p>Yet not One Word from the obamanation asking his people to act in a lawful and respectful manner without regard to the outcome of the election. Knowing from history the actions of certain people when they see an opportunity to loot, steal, or burn you would think he would at least ask for calm and legal behaviour. The reason just might be he loves the veiled threat because it might scare decent people to oppose him?</p>

			<p>Some reports claim up to one million people may turn up around the park. This might seem fanciful given that Chicago&rsquo;s population is just three million, but the city has been boosted by a massive influx of devoted Obama fans.</p>
<p>Some of them aren&rsquo;t even journalists.</p>
<p>Freeways leading to Chicago have in recent days seen convoys of church buses - big vans bearing church identification and carrying whole congregations of religious Obamaphiles - into town.</p>
<p>They are, quite literally, holy rollers. If Obama wins, these will be the people shown on TV reaching for the heavens and shouting scripture.<br>

			<p>Chicago is the most racist city in America! Look at the police chief who was recently convicted for torturing Black and Latino suspects and coercing them into admitting guilt.</p>
<p>I also remember the ugliness that was spewed during the Harold Washington mayoral race in 1983. I was a teenager at the time. They may have Oprah, but the vast majority of Whites in Chicago are racists!!!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Perhaps they fear power most of all and as long as Whites are in power they will hate them. Under this line of thinking, a non-White is useful in disrupting the powerful Whites that rank and file Liberals wish they could become.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quite illuminating. The double-irony is that liberals really are the power, and the masses still behave just the way you describe them anyway. <br>

<p>Do you remember the utter, staggering incompetence and corruption of the Washington regime, more akin to the &#8220;governments&#8221; of African pestholes than to an American administration?</p>
