						<p>Seven of ten Latin-Americans are against, non-citizen people or of different race living in their country, revealed today the survey &#8220;Opportunities of Regional Integration&#8221; carried out in 18 countries of the continent in 2007.</p>
<p>The poll, an initiative of the Andean Corporation of Promotion (CAF) and the organization Latinobarómetro, was presented today in Lima by the executive president of the CAF, Enrique Garcia, and Peruvian authorities.</p>
<p>Upon taking the issue of the attitude towards immigrants, the study found that only 24 percent are in favor of foreigners of the same race or ethnic group of citizens comming to live to their country.</p>
<p>15 percent are in favor of receiving people of poorer countries and 14 percent are in favor of foreigners of different race or ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The most open countries to the arrival of foreigners of the same race or ethnic group are Uruguay (41 percent) and Nicaragua (39 percent), while Costa Rica is the most against to that possibility (9 percent).</p>
<p>In turn, among the most open nations to the arrival of people of poorer nations, Uruguay appears again (27 percent), followed by Mexico and Nicaragua (both with 22 percent).</p>
<p>The most against this practice is Ecuador (4 percent) and Paraguay (7 percent).</p>
<p>On the possibility that foreigners of different race comming to live to their country, the most receptive are Uruguay (30 percent), Argentina, Colombia and Nicaragua (20 percent).</p>
<p>While the most against is Ecuador (3 percent) and Paraguay (7 percent).</p>
<p>The study affirmed that &#8220;Latin America does not seem to welcome immigrants&#8221;.<br>

			<p>By God, the white illness follows us wherever we go.  Uruguay and Argentina most welcomes demographic suicide because they&rsquo;re the most white countries in south america.  What is wrong with us?  The white race is clearly unfit to live, there&rsquo;s some deep seated genetic flaw that will destroy us all no matter where we run.</p>

			<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve tried to explain to (and failed for the most part) my Congressmen is that &#8220;latinos&#8221; in the United States feel exactly the same way. The reason is simple.  A HUGE number of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; and almost all illegal immigrants, have left their country of origin because they are unwanted.  Often, it&rsquo;s because they are poor and poor people destroy neighborhoods.  But too often, it&rsquo;s because they are criminals and they fear being killed in their country of origin, extrajudicially (which is EXTREMELY common).  They come to the US and the first thing they do is start dealing drugs.  The second thing they do is look for victims to rape, rob, murder and assault.  Almost all live in the hispanic community because they speak no english and cannot survive anywhere else.  Most have stolen other&rsquo;s identities and all are, legally or not, draining the welfare system dry.  To be blunt, they turn our communities into hell holes and we are tired of it.</p>
<p>Remember that the next time some white liberal tries to tell you that hispanics want open borders.</p>

<p>Of course, the non-whites are perfectly comfortable with exporting their &#8220;excess&#8221; elsewhere, preferrabbly to white countries.</p>

			<p>Not surprising. This is one of those cases where there is a total disconnect between a group of people and those who claim to speak for them. I&rsquo;ve never met a Mexican-American who wasn&rsquo;t nativist to the core. They see exactly what&rsquo;s going on here. Cheap, illegal labor is being used as an economic bludgeon to drive wages down. I think also, on a subconscious level at least, Mexican-Americans realize instinctively that Mexico is a mess because it&rsquo;s populated by Mexicans, and that&rsquo;s therefore in their best interest to keep this country mostly white.</p>

<p>For a wonderful movie that properly depicts this, watch the movie &#8220;City of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think Maxim (?) magazine a couple of years ago had an article about some criminal that had a caused a big uprising in various Brazilian prisons and that he issued some sort of edict to kill the copper&rsquo;s mothers. Well, the coppers weren&rsquo;t going to take this stuff lying down and proceeded to kill the CRIMINAL&rsquo;S mother.</p>

<p>Argentina has always known to be open to European immigrants.  It still is.  The problem now is that the government is allowing more nonwhite immigrants in.  People in the Anglosphere say that we are all equal and that race doesn&rsquo;t matter and that we are all immigrants, like they like to say in the USA. Well, Argentina worked out well because of its legacy of allowing mostly white European immigrants into the country.  Now that they changed their policies, it is starting to get dark there.  Their attitude towards immigration will change once they can&rsquo;t even walk down the streets anymore or be able to communicate in Spanish with the local grocer.  Argentineans have been very tolerant towards immigrants from Europe and that has been a long-standing tradition.  Russian immigrants still keep coming to Argentina, for example.  That is an example, however, things will change with the changing demographics of allowing nonwhites in.  That has been the case in all white countries.  </p>
<p>Costa Rica doesn&rsquo;t like Columbians because they commit a lot of murders so they curtail the amount they let in.  I heard from my friend there that they don&rsquo;t even allow Columbians in anymore.  They do allow Nicaraguans for cheap labor though.  Mexico is racist so they don&rsquo;t let anyone of different races in very easily.  This has been known especially with the harrassment of the Chinese immigrants to Mexico.  I heard that they practically kicked out all the Chinese from there because of their racist zeal.  </p>
<p>The nonwhites all over the world are more chauvinistic and racist and the whiter countries have been known to be more generous.  This is why Argentina has been known to be the &#8220;mother of immigrants&#8221; in its time.  They should wake up though to the changing times and understand that their racial stock is at risk like in North America and Europe.</p>

			<p>I wish I could say that I had met a lot of Chicanos against the Illegals. Among the young ones especially, they are 100% pro-illegal. Most of the older ones seem to be too. Here in CA probably 85% of legal Hispanics are regarded as traitors by Whites because they are 100% behind the illegals. You try to explain to them how the illegals are totally screwing them too, but they just cannot see it. They 100% think racially, have tremendous ethnic pride and look out for their ethnic group. You know, all the things that Whites are not allowed to do. There is a relationship between us not being allowed to feel pride and the fact that my state is being destroyed by an army of illegal aliens. Actually, most of the Whites around here are pro-illegal too, especially if they are at all liberal in any way. Almost any White who has money loves the illegals. If you have a house, you love them, because you want them to work in the yard. Here in CA, we have a whole state full of Whites drinking the kool-aid. It is actually dangerous to talk against illegals around here - I have had people tell me to shut up many times. Almost everyone here regards anti-illegal sentiment as racist, and that includes 85% of the Hispanics. If you speak against illegals in public, young Hispanic gangbangers will threaten you. You can&rsquo;t even call ICE out here - I never even bother because I figure they will not come out. ICE almost never makes raids in California and my whole town is swarming with illegals. Seal off Main Street at mid-day and arrest 300 of them.</p>
<p>Considering that any sane person can see how these illegals have destroyed this town, it&rsquo;s strange indeed, the huge number of Whites who support them. Maybe they are afraid of them. Maybe they drank the Kool-Aid. Who knows. </p>

			<p>I am Uruguayan I have lived here in Montevideo all my life and this result is no surprise to me. </p>
<p>Uruguayans and Argentinians(but specially Uruguayans) are the most wellcoming to inmigrants because there are a myth here in Uruguay that we are all equal, that no matter where you are from or what genes do you have the Uruguayan educational system will make of you a great man.</p>
<p>We are told that African-Uruaguayans are fantastics because they gave us &#8220;Candombe&#8221; and a few good soccer players and that white people must be ashamed for having killed the lasts Charrúas.</p>
<p>But despite all of this 30% doesnt look to high. Bring here more low quallity immigrants and this number will fall dramatically.</p>

			<p> The open borders/political elite in this country (translate Ted Kennedy) keep feeding us the same nonsense as do the Hispanic self-appointed like La Raza.<br>
 The assertion is that all &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are alike. Try calling a Dominican a Salvadoran or Puerto Rican, then duck. There are great cultural and ethnic divisions between these groups, but we are lectured to see them as monolithic in nature.<br>
 Even the LA Times, in an article about a year ago, was forced to point out that Cesar Chavez was vehemently against illegal immigration as he knew it would destroy any union he could create.<br>
 Why does the Mexican government interfer with our political process regarding immigration? It is because they have no intention of taking care of their own citizens, most of whom they look down upon. Send them North so they can send back remittances.</p>

			<p>Robert Lindsay brings up some very valid points in his post. What really blow MY mind, however, is that Blacks are rabid in their support of Obama, whom they apparently regard as their race champion. What&rsquo;s wrong with that, you might ask&hellip;</p>
<p>Simply that Obama is both PRO illegal immigration and PRO amnesty. The problem is that low-skilled, under-educated Blacks are losing out everywhere in the manual labor job market to illegals. That Blacks generally don&rsquo;t have the intelligence to realize they&rsquo;re being hit first and hardest by illegal immigration is hardly surprising. But that their Champion, Obama, is solidly FOR continued illegal immigration is! Either the &#8220;Obamination&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about his kinfolks, or he&rsquo;s figuring on their being life-long welfare clients. Your guess being as good as mine.</p>

			<p>I am surrounded. The city I live in today is 12.4% of the population, down from 70% in 1970 and I&rsquo;m planning on moving. The Mexicans I run into believe in free and open borders and that the Southwest of the USA should simply be abandoned by us gringos. Every year it&rsquo;s another million arriving. </p>

			<p>Robert Lindsay, whites are afraid of illegals in California. I have seen white cashiers at supermarkets, mostly women, who wouldn&rsquo;t give a seconds glance at a cute little white kid, almost fall over the counter in adoration of some little Mexican kid. They usually have a smile on their faces as fixed as the syrup on yesterdays pancakes and make me ill when I watch them. Strange how so many white people always make comments like &#8220;the things we are not allowed to do&#8221;,etc. I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing, the more whites who don&rsquo;t do WHATEVER their not allowed to do, the more will not be allowed to do &#8220;IT&#8221; in the future. As so many people on this forum and in other places have noticed, Mexicans, as a rule, are racially concious and actualize that attitude all the time, unlike whites, or even many blacks,despite what some people say.</p>
