<p>What is relevant is this: An FBI analysis of homicide reports from 2005 showed that 45 percent of homicides were white-on-white and 42 percent were black-on-black.</p>
<p>At first glance, that statistic seems meaningless until you consider that there are nearly 200 million white people in America and only about 36 million black people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>How can black people be expected to receive equal treatment when we can&rsquo;t even treat each other as equals? How can we demand to be respected and to be treated civilly when so many of us disrespect each other and act uncivilized?</p>
<p>Renowned 19th and 20th century writer Elbert Hubbard said, &#8220;You can lead a boy to college, but you can&rsquo;t make him think.&#8221; And you can show communities the evidence, but you can&rsquo;t make them interpret it. For the many people who are quick to say non-blacks are the enemies, they need to think again. For the most part, black people are blacks&rsquo; worst enemies.</p>
<p>When we harm each other and show the world what we think of our own culture, we may as well crumple our own resumes. We may as well deny our own loan applications. We may as well (and we do) call ourselves the &#8220;N&#8221; word.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As a black man I am critical of my culture, not because I look down on it, but because I have high expectations for myself and other members of my culture. It is incredibly difficult to try to fix a massive social problem externally, such as race relations, when there&rsquo;s so much internal aggression.</p>
<p>Without cultural pride and preservation, it is difficult for any community or culture to adequately survive. There are so many bigger dragons to slay than a fellow human. Poverty, drugs, poor parenting and lack of education are much more dangerous to the community than any person ever could be. This is mainly because these things are directly responsible for producing the people that bring down many communities, not just the black ones.</p>
<p>In an age where opportunities are more limitless for minorities, it&rsquo;s disturbing to see some people behave like the heathens we were once called. The fact that black people are allowed on this campus shows how far the university (and society, for that matter) has come. However, incidents such as what happened in the Circle last week, show how far we have to go as a community.<br>

					<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.  I&rsquo;m black american and I resent when blacks put all their problems on the white man.  If the truth be told, I thank God my ancestors survived the passage to America from america during slavery. When I think about what has gone wrong in Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda and Somalia, I can&rsquo;t help but praise the Lord.  The white man don&rsquo;t owe me an apology but just respect as a fellow human being.</p>

					<p>Yeah&hellip;.they left out a very important part.  The part where blacks victimize more whites than they do blacks.  At first glance, this would seem to make sense.  There are far more whites in this country than blacks.  So, if you choose a victim at random, it&rsquo;s much more likely just by random chance that he is white.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that we live under extreme, de facto segregation in this country.  Overwhelmingly, blacks and whites simply do not live anywhere near eachother.  This is true not only on a community/neighborhood scale but on a much larger geographic scale.  How severe is this self-segregation?  One only has to look at a map charting the last census data:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.censusscope.org/us/map_nhblack.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.censusscope.org/us/map_nhblack.html</a></p>
<p>Clearly, most blacks are squeezed down into the south eastern <span class="caps">US.</span></p>
<p>My point is that a black criminal, the type of person most likely to live under the most segregated conditions, has to go out of his way to get a white victim.  Although it is a pain in the ass, he makes the extra effort.  Why?  Because the greater part of his motivation for committing the crime in the first place is racist hatred against whites.</p>

<p>Wow, a very profound and true statement, if I may say so. But, does this also apply to people of American-European ancestry or would that be considered a crime in and of itself?</p>

					<p>Are his statistics correct?  The Color of Crime reports more black-on-white than black-on-black homicides.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m pleased to see a black man speak truthfully about blacks.  He deserves respect.  The black community still does not.</p>

					<p>The event in the Circle:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a link to the event, but a black girl that was fighting with other black girls over a basketball player cut up three people with a box cutter in the middle of the Ole Miss campus, right on the spot where the riots to let in James Meredith occured.</p>

					<p>Of course there is always that problem of average <span class="caps">IQ, </span>which determines the ability of the group to comprehend and apply good council or leadership.  There are a few intelligent black people but the black masses cannot comprehend the advice given.  </p>
<p>The white race is suffering from this problem as well.  <br>

<p>&gt; I can live with this black man in my society - as long as he is also true to his own race in other ways as well.</p>
<p>If we allowed one another to have our races and cultures, occassionally visiting one another would be fine.  I don&rsquo;t wish for genocide of any type, just the space for all to live responsibly and responsible to their own kind.<br>

<p><span class="caps">LOL.</span> Exactly what I was thinking when I read that. Aren&rsquo;t we constantly told we are racists for wanting to maintain our culture when we want illegal immigration stopped? We are called xenophobes to no end. But it is perfectly fine for a black or hispanic (even encouraged) to be proud of their horribly failed cultures. Hypocrites on the left are amazing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a tip&hellip; Start by treating whites as your equals.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Yes, please do. (American) Whites wasted a generation of young men and &#8216;scorched earth&rsquo; on about half of their nation in order to force a minority of greedy, stubborn slaveholders (who drug the entire South into the war) to treat you as equals. Is it too much to ask that you follow the golden rule?</p>
