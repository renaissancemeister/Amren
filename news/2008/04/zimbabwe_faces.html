						<p>Just as Tommy Miller was milking his Friesian herd early yesterday morning, the mob stormed into Dunluce Farm. Armed with sticks, stones and a shotgun, they ordered him to stop. He refused. The cows had to be milked or they would become ill. &#8220;This is the law,&#8221; replied their dreadlocked leader, brandishing his baton. &#8220;You must throw the milk on the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they rampaged through Zimbabwe&rsquo;s last productive farms, Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s feared militiamen threatened to drive the country to starvation with a campaign not just to reclaim white-owned land but to destroy the farming system.</p>
<p>Reports flooding into farmers&rsquo; unions in Harare yesterday told of the wilful destruction of farm equipment, produce and buildings as part of an alleged &#8220;popular uprising&#8221; by government-backed mobs in the name of getting the land back for the black population. Agriculturalists fear that the country could run out of food within weeks as the farm invasions stop the maize harvest in mid-flow and threaten the future of wheat crops with only four weeks left for planting.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, 60 commercial farmers &mdash; including two black farmers with opposition sympathies &mdash; had been evicted from their farms by mobs of so-called war veterans, the shock troops unleashed by Mr Mugabe in a desperate attempt to cling to power. Dozens more have fled their farms, unwilling to resist the increasingly violent mobs, which have set fire to farm labourers&rsquo; huts and beaten workers.</p>
<p>Up to 300 veterans, in T-shirts of the ruling Zanu (PF) party, turned up at Mr Miller&rsquo;s sprawling dairy farm south of Harare yesterday, closing down production when he refused to leave, and surrounding his heavily fortified house to try to flush him out.</p>
<p>Milk has become one of the scarcest commodities in Zimbabwe since the first invasions in early 2000, and long queues form from early morning in the rare places it can be found on sale. In a land of such desperate hunger, the wanton waste of milk seems unbelievable. But while millions of Zimbabweans spent their day in the exhausting search for food, Mugabe supporters spent theirs in a frenzied effort to destroy the supply chain.</p>
<p>The militias, financed by trillions of Zimbabwean dollars printed since Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s apparent election defeat 11 days ago &mdash; official results have still not been announced &mdash; are answering a call to arms to defend the land from a new white invasion and reclaim what is held by the country&rsquo;s few hundred white farmers. Mr Mugabe has cast the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) as the stooges of former British colonial rulers, claiming that it is seeking to hand back land to ousted whites.</p>
<p>When two white Times journalists drove to Dunluce Farm yesterday on the pretext of buying meat, the car was set upon by the chanting mob occupying the farm. They dragged a cart across the driveway to block an escape and gathered, chanting and mocking, round the car. &#8220;The butchery is closed, the farm is closed,&#8221; their leader said. &#8220;This is the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similar tales were told by the white farmers fleeing to Harare for safety and congregating at the offices of the Commercial Farmers&rsquo; Union (CFU) to report attacks on their farms. &#8220;They are saying they have come to reeducate the people and repossess the land,&#8221; one white farmer from Mashonaland Central said, refusing to give his name for fear of retribution.</p>
<p>Too afraid to return to his farm, he was fretting over what would happen to his wheat crops, which must be planted within four weeks. Other farmers were evicted or fled in the middle of the maize harvest, raising fears over how long the country could last on its food stocks. Zimbabwe needs 23,000 tonnes of maize a week to feed its population, half of which it imports. Its remaining stocks stand at just two thirds of that figure. Trevor Gifford, president of the CFU, calculated that more than 1,000 lorryloads of maize would have to be imported every week just to keep the country at subsistence level.</p>
<p>The political limbo, meanwhile, shows no signs of ending. Yesterday a court postponed the opposition&rsquo;s petition for the release of disputed election results, as news emerged that officials had been arrested for allegedly undercounting Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s vote.</p>
<p>There is no sign of the promised run-off between Mr Mugabe and his challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, but every sign of a violent campaign unfolding to intimidate opposition supporters. In Harare, the queues for basic food-stuffs stretched along the pavements into the evening. &#8220;We are suffering here,&#8221; said one woman, holding her crying baby. &#8220;When will it end?&#8221;<br>

			<p>I feel for the farmers, who have been demonized by mugabe as if they were criminals. I wish there were one US senator with the stones to stand up and ask for refugee status for these white farmers here in the US. Since they are white, CNN will ignore them. </p>
<p> As for the rest of the country, they are reaping what they have sown with a criminal dictator. I dont care one bit about any of them. As terrible as it sounds, even the starving kids dont bother me. This was absolutely foreseeable by anyone with a bit of sense about them. Let them starve, and then retake the country, and put it in responsible hands. We have seen the effects of white control and black control.. which one was better? </p>

			<p>I feel for the white farmers, but in a way this is good. It means these people with no &#8220;future time orientation&#8221; can possibly starve, get sick and die off. Maybe the best and the brightest will survive and revert back to their tribal warfare. Then the balance may be restored again. The fact is we have been supporting the lowest of the low for too long and they have reproduced accordingly. It&rsquo;s time to let them have their way with each other WITHOUT our support. </p>

</i><p>What&rsquo;s surprising about &#8220;wanton waste&#8221; by Africans?  Don&rsquo;t people remember the &#8220;riots&#8221; in black ghettos in the 1960&rsquo;s?  Incredulous people (who had just swallowed a bunch of pablum about &#8220;civil rights&#8221; and &#8220;racial equality&#8221;) gasped back then that &#8220;they&rsquo;re burning down their <i>own neighborhoods!&#8221;</i>  <p>There&rsquo;s no surer way for the natural destructiveness of blacks to reveal itself than when they&rsquo;re in control, be it of a neighborhood, or of a country.</p></p></p>

Only in degree does the situation in Zimbabwe differ from that of our own cities that were invaded and occupied following the Government&rsquo;s infamous Brown mandate. </p>
<p>Were the full truth to be revealed by the controlled &#8220;news&#8221;, though, we might find the difference is not really all that great, although the blood shed is probably much greater here than there.  Of course there are still enough areas remaining in our own country that have not (yet) been overrun, so the invaders and the occupiers can still be fed.  </p>
<p>A sign that perceptual changes may be on the way, though, is indicated by the revelation by the &#8220;news&#8221; of the reporters&rsquo; race in the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;When two white Times journalists drove to Dunluce Farm yesterday on the pretext of buying meat, the car was set upon by the chanting mob occupying the farm. They dragged a cart across the driveway to block an escape and gathered, chanting and mocking, round the car. &ldquo;The butchery is closed, the farm is closed,&rdquo; their leader said. &ldquo;This is the law.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Are the &#8220;news&#8221; people now beginning to deal with reality, rather than in the discredited social theories being promoted by our &#8220;intellectual&#8221; class and which are being implemented by our corrupt Legal-Political complex?</p>

			<p>Having killed the goose that lays the golden eggs, we will soon be hearing cries from the goose killers and their sympathizers for more golden eggs to be supplied by the West.  This will happen as soon as the sight of starving Zimbabweans begins showing up on television screens.  You may protest the insanity of your taxes being used to feed the Zimbabweans all you wish.  The politicians will be deaf to your outrage and will do exactly as they please with your tax dollars, as is always the case.  </p>

			<blockquote>In Harare, the queues for basic food-stuffs stretched along the pavements into the evening. &ldquo;We are suffering here,&rdquo; said one woman, holding her crying baby. &ldquo;When will it end?&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>It will end when the population of Zimbabwe is at about 1% of it&rsquo;s present level of 27,000,000, or at about 270,000 people, the way it was about a century ago before whites started farming.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe is going back to the bush. The process is inexorable, a function of an average IQ of 65. Zimbabwe must become as it was 100 years ago, and replacing Robert Mugabe will change little or nothing.</p>
<p>Anyone with any common sense at all knew back in 1979 when Carter was trying to end white rule in Rhodesia that this is the way it would end up.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time we cease attempting to change Africa, and gracefully acknowledge that there is nothing we can do to stop its entirely natural course of auto-annihilation.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s the law to destroy the country&rsquo;s food infrasctructure in the name of reclaiming white owned lands and repelling an imaginary invasion by whites?! This is remarkable for two reasons. (1) What kind of logic is that linking planned famine, a lost election and imaginary invaders? (2) How much longer can the blame whites game last when applied to every unrelated woes?</p>
<p>This is another Live Aid African crisis in the making. And James Watson was metaphorically hung by the noose for predicting it.</p>

<p>Never, I&rsquo;m afraid. It took the West 2500 years to grasp logic and mathmatics, understand the foolishness of Tribal or Religious Kings, destroy the concept of Aristocracy, throw off World Socialism and make the first tenitive steps toward a Jeffersonian/Randian Civilization. That was with courage, intelligence and luck on our side. </p>
<p>Africa shows not a glimmer of grasping these concepts. Spilling Milk on the ground while children go hungry? Interrupting the harvest in the middle of a famine? Blaming the productive for the government thugs destruction of your own crops?</p>
<p>Madness. <br>

			<p>I feel more concern for the unfortunate farm animals than for any blacks in Zim.  The blacks voluteered for this starvation/famine.  The farm animals merely exist to serve us.  We owe them care and compassion.</p>
<p>Your children need milk, but you pour the milk into the grass?  This is not madness.  To say this is madness is to give those who are mad a bad name.</p>
<p>I have no name for this.  It is beyond human comprehension.</p>

			<p>You ask why? It is not political or social but rather Spiritual, and I mean that very literally. Even a very sick animal will not much violate instincts for survival, except to remove itself from others to preserve the species. If you want to see madness, look to humans, demoralized, degraded. To get where Zimbabwe is now, you need to first build it up to Rhodesia, introduce and rule with superior Judeo-Christian principles, as stated in another comment increase the population through farming and transport, but THEN introduce demonic socialist dogmas (Mugabe is an old-school Maoist) and tear down and defame the real churches while celebrating endless pagan rites and practices, and invent a mythic tribal past. Hmmm, looks like much of the West these days! We may yet catch up to Zimbabwe.</p>

			<p>When fighter pilots have an in-flight emergency, they often report that they are so busy trying to solve the problem (as is their wont, and their training), that they have to hear this three times:</p>
<p><b>BAIL OUT! BAIL OUT! BAIL OUT!</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for the Whites in that country to get the hell out while they are still alive. What have they got to lose? If they die in the attempt, so what? Not to sound callous, but in their present situation they are CERTAIN to die. They might as WELL try to leave.</p>

			<p>I personally understand the Africans proclivity for self destruction, but I do not understand why white farmers are concerned about their crops which would be used to feed the very people who are out killing or running off the white farmers. I also predict that Robert Mugabe will end up being a president in exile in the U.S. or in Saudi living as a king on the national treasury (if any exists) of Zimba.</p>

			<p>I frequently travel to both Zimbabwe and Zambia for business. During my earlier - more naive - years I would often ask the same questions that any foreigner would ask and when I got an answer I would react by saying something the whites there would concider stupid. </p>
<p>They use a quaint adage: &#8220;disconnect your logic chip&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have learnt that this is exactly what Whites should do when trying to wrap our minds around all thing Black.</p>

My brother( ex A-6 Intruder Bombadier) told me  when they yell it three times  it was for a different  reason than aviators being too busy to hear the command. It was so a  new and jumpy guy doesn`t go on one instead of three. As what happened in his squadron. Pilot: We need to bail out&hellip;(Co-pilot hears bail out and blows canopy) (pilot continues to himself&hellip;) if the fuel consumption rate  means we can`t get all the way   back to the carrier. Say it once and it`s an in-flight discussion about possibilities and options. Three times in rapid succession makes it a command! </p>

			<p>A Black is responsible for the starvation and misery of his people. Nothing much in the US news about it. People actually hurt.<br>
Someone hangs a noose, the media are all over it.<br>
No one hurt.</p>
<p>Obviously the American media likes the fact that a Black is making life miserable for other Blacks.</p>

The reason conditions in Zimbabwe get scant coverage is because the black apologists and the press can&rsquo;t find a way to blame white people for these problems.</p>
<p>If they could find a way to link it to &#8216;racist&rsquo; white policies, then it would be headline news. Because they can&rsquo;t find a lie, the media resort to hiding the truth.<br>

<p>Posted by H. Dumpty at 1:19 AM on April 10 </p>
<p>H. Dumpty:</p>
<p>Amazingly, there was an article in the LA Times last weekend, which I found rather odd coming from such a suppressor of news about black-on-White crime and defender of every left-wing, anti-White cause.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also read that the LA Times has lost approximately 40% of its readership in the last 15 years and laid off thousands of workers.</p>
<p>Good.  May it deservedly go down in flames with the old Soviet bosses who run it.</p>
<p>From the LA Times:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Eighteen farmers were threatened and several were forced to flee their properties as they were besieged by chanting, drum-beating mobs. Representatives of the farmers said there was no police response even as the situation worsened late Sunday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m feeling a bit speechless and a bit gutted at the moment, to be honest,&rsquo; said one of the farmers, who asked that his name not be used for fear of inflaming a volatile situation. He, his wife and three children moved out for safety, after hearing 50 people were approaching the farm to evict him&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evict him or kill him?</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Another farmers&rsquo; representative, John Worsick of Justice for Agriculture, said [White] farmers were afraid of losing everything. He said officials from the ruling ZANU-PF party had told him the government&rsquo;s aim was to get all white farmers off their land by April 18, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s independence day.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are being told that by Independence Day they want to be able to say [to the people], &#8216;We gave you all your land. Every white farmer is off. What more can we give you?&rsquo; Worsick said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-zimbabwe7apr07,1,1002935.story" rel="nofollow">http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-zimbabwe7apr07,1,1002935.story</a></p>
<p>I also wasn&rsquo;t aware there were any Whites left in Zim, let alone White farmers.  How are they surviving the chaos and tyranny?  Who is advocating for them?</p>
<p>The very best article I&rsquo;ve read on the situation was posted by Stephanie a few articles back.  I encourage everyone to read (and re-read) it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a small excerpt:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.As President Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s emissary to Africa, [Andrew) Young played a pivotal role  &mdash;  along with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, and other Carter administration officials  &mdash;  in enthroning Mugabe&rsquo;s terror regime and turning much of the Dark Continent into the nightmarish slaughterhouse of chaos and terror it has become&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Official figures vary, but it can be roughly estimated that around 30,000 Matabele were slaughtered in Mugabe&rsquo;s &#8216;liberation&rsquo; of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe&hellip; Mugabe&hellip; would go on to slaughter Zimbabwe&rsquo;s white farmers, take away their land, and plunge the nation into a hell hole of debt, hunger, hyperinflation, murder, HIV/Aids, and hopelessness&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The part about Kissenger&rsquo;s meeting with Smith in Geneva is not to be missed.</p>

			<p>  I have a feeling that an Obama presidency will open the gates to &ldquo;suffering&#8221; refugees from Africa no matter what their backgrounds or political views are. I can foresee a day when these &#8220;war veterans&#8221; are resettled in places like Minnesota and West Virginia at public expense to escape the situation that they helped create.</p>

			<p>Any sensible white should have seen this coming when the despicable nature of Mugabe became clear - and gotten out years ago. </p>
<p>Zimbabwe is the worst of all worlds, a nation insanely run by black racist imbeciles, enraged by their own incompetence in comparison to the few whites still left among them. - And they will inevitably loot and kill the rest of them, too, Mugabe&rsquo;s followers have no other fuel but envy and violence. </p>

			<p>I still remember how after the uprising Blacks Zimbabweans, who were once squatters in the former Rhodesia, were vowing Blacks would not only be able to maintain the farms, but that they would thrive and flourish at the hands of blacks. They might have been successful with their guerilla tactics of killing and chasing off most of the white farmers, but now with most of them gone, they are desperately clammoring for the last vestiges of food and farmlife remaining in the region. After swarming over what remains like hungry locusts the land will be totally barren. I fear the same fate could await South Africa, with so many Blacks hungry for power, and eager to remove whites from their farms, jobs, and homes, but of course the outcome would not be pretty for Blacks either. Such realities never seem to sink in with them until it is too late.<br>

			<p>Every Zimbabwe child that starves to death is one less breeder who would have otherwise reached adulthood and had more children than he could afford to feed.  Giving food aid rewards those who irresponsibly overpopulate their country and is the height of cruelty and stupidity&hellip;       </p>

			<p>A few thoughts.</p>
<p>As the African population spends it&rsquo;s last gasp of expansion, and as the white population begin to stumble under this world-wide madness, the famines of old will return and reduce the African population back to what a &#8220;hunter-gather&#8221; ecology can support. We whites can not support all this with our diminishing numbers and debt load. Africa&rsquo;s future is massive famine.</p>
<p>As the white birth rate plummets, the African survival rate will plummet even faster, thus allowing whites to win this population race. The fewer Africans to feed, the fewer to migrate to White Europe.</p>
<p>We are also witnessing the first cases of De-Industrialization ever known. I have written about this before. Nations will De-Industrialize. This has never happened before but the two conditions necessary for this to happen now exist. (1) A modern civilization (2) taken over by Africans. </p>
<p>First was Zimbabwe and next is South Africa. Places like Nigeria, Angola never got to the &#8220;civilization&#8221; level before the Africans took over thus this De-Industrialization was not so profound nor obvious (but it did happen). I can&rsquo;t wait to see how the PC crowd explains this&hellip;oh, it is from the legacy of slavery and colonialization&hellip;yeah&hellip;OK.</p>

<p>Check out the pictures of Detroit on this website.  Abandoned factories, banks, homes, hotels, etc. and the forest is reclaiming the city.  There are even trees growing on the tops of abandoned buildings. </p>

			<p>&#8220;This is madness&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>If it was merely &#8220;madness&#8221;, it could be treated with psychotherapy and perhaps some medication.  I very much doubt this is the case.</p>
<p>Pouring milk on the ground in a country where one&rsquo;s children are starving is evil and stupidity.</p>

			<p>To LOGIC,</p>
<p>You write bull.  Black racist africans are killing whites out of africa and colonizing white nations at the same time.  They won&rsquo;t die off - we will - many of us at their hands.</p>

<p> You are quite correct. All &#8216;food aid&rsquo; does is enable these people and causes more problems then it solves.</p>
