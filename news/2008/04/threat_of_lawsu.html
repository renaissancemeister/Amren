						<p>A far-right Dutch lawmaker says he will make changes to a controversial film that accuses the Muslim holy book, the Koran, of inciting violence.</p>
<p>The film, which has drawn widespread protest, contains an incendiary cartoon showing the Prophet Muhammad wearing a turban resembling a bomb.</p>
<p>Film producer Geert Wilders confirmed Monday that he will edit out the caricature, after the original artist threatened a lawsuit for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Dutch entertainer Salah Edin also threatened to sue, complaining the film wrongly identifies him as the Muslim radical who killed a Dutch right-wing filmmaker in 2004.</p>
<p>Wilder posted the film on his political party&rsquo;s Internet site last week, triggering protests in the United Nations and across the Muslim world, where such depictions are considered blasphemy.</p>
<p>In Indonesia Monday, several-dozen members of a hardline Islamic group rallied outside the Dutch Embassy in Jakarta to protest the film.</p>
<p>At the rally, some 40-members of the Islamic Defenders Front demanded that the Indonesian government cut ties with Amsterdam in response to the film.</p>
<p>Wilders says he made the film to show how Muslim immigration is a threat to Europe&rsquo;s democracies. In it, he alternates images of terrorist attacks with quotations from the Koran.<br>

															<h2><a href="https://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/CultureAndMedia/?id=1.0.2028674061">Indonesia: Government Bans Anti-Koran Film</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>AKI (The Hague), April 1, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Indonesia has banned the controversial anti-Koran film by the Dutch right-wing MP, Geert Wilders.</p>
<p>The Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono called for calm in the mainly Muslim nation on Tuesday and said that Wilders would also be barred from entering the country.</p>
<p>Wilders&rsquo; 17-minute film entitled Fitna, criticised Islam&rsquo;s holy book, the Koran. The film sets verses of the Koran against a background of images from terrorist attacks. It accuses Islam of inspiring violence.</p>
<p>Small groups of protestors had gathered outside the embassy of the Netherlands in Jakarta to protest against the film. Indonesia is the world&rsquo;s most populous Muslim nation with some 90 percent of its 230 million people following Islam.</p>
<p>The Dutch government has condemned the film and Dutch broadcasters have avoided showing it. The video had been posted on a video-sharing website.</p>
<p>Reports say that Wilders has received death threats and is under police protection.<br>

<p>Wilders is not stupid and had to know this would happen.  A courageous man has made his point.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the big deal about this film. It depicts truth in both images and verse. How can truth be controversial? </p>

<p>The truth is Lucky to be elevated to &#8216;controversial&rsquo;, in this day and age&hellip;</p>

<p>I figured it was the least I could do to help stem the tide of islamic domination that threatens my children and grandchildren&rsquo;s future. I don&rsquo;t know if anything can be done when our own leaders are calling islam and religion of peace. What a joke that phrase is when applied to islam. I will never fear or back down for the tyrants.</p>
<p>Stay strong friends. </p>

<p>I saw the original &#8216;Fitna&rsquo;. It was STELLAR. You would think the European Journalist who drew the original cartoons would be TICKLED PINK to have his graphic used in such a film. I, for one, would buy a lithograph of that cartoon merely by having it seen in Fitna.</p>
<p>Now, I wouldn&rsquo;t even use that image for toilet paper, because the originator is AFRAID to stand up and be counted as a European who says &#8220;NO&#8221; to the Hagarenes. </p>
<p>What did he think would happen when he drew the cartoon in the first place? A Nobel Peace Prize?</p>
