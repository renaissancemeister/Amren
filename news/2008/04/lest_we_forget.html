<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>I HAVE COME home from a long stay in Mexico to find &mdash; because of the presidential campaign, and especially because of the Obama/Clinton race for the Democratic nomination &mdash; a new country existing alongside the old. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I am a supporter of Obama because I believe he is the right person to lead the country at this time. He offers a rare opportunity for the country and the world to start over, and to do better. It is a deep sadness to me that many of my feminist white women friends cannot see him. Cannot see what he carries in his being. Cannot hear the fresh choices toward Movement he offers. That they can believe that millions of Americans &mdash; black, white, yellow, red and brown &mdash; choose Obama over Clinton only because he is a man, and black, feels tragic to me.</p>
<p>{snip} If Obama were in any sense mediocre, he would be forgotten by now. He is, in fact, a remarkable human being, not perfect but humanly stunning, like King was and like Mandela is. We look at him, as we looked at them, and are glad to be of our species. He is the change America has been trying desperately and for centuries to hide, ignore, kill. The change America must have if we are to convince the rest of the world that we care about people other than our (white) selves.</p>
<p>True to my inner Goddess of the Three Directions however, this does not mean I agree with everything Obama stands for. We differ on important points probably because I am older than he is, I am a woman and person of three colors, (African, Native American, European), I was born and raised in the American South, and when I look at the earth&rsquo;s people, after sixty-four years of life, there is not one person I wish to see suffer, no matter what they have done to me or to anyone else; though I understand quite well the place of suffering, often, in human growth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is hard to relate what it feels like to see Mrs. Clinton (I wish she felt self-assured enough to use her own name) referred to as &#8220;a woman&#8221; while Barack Obama is always referred to as &#8220;a black man.&#8221; One would think she is just any woman, colorless, race-less, past-less, but she is not. She carries all the history of white womanhood in America in her person; it would be a miracle if we, and the world, did not react to this fact. How dishonest it is, to attempt to make her innocent of her racial inheritance.</p>
<p>I can easily imagine Obama sitting down and talking, person to person, with any leader, woman, man, child or common person, in the world, with no baggage of past servitude or race supremacy to mar their talks. I cannot see the same scenario with Mrs. Clinton who would drag into Twenty-First Century American leadership the same image of white privilege and distance from the reality of others&rsquo; lives that has so marred our country&rsquo;s contacts with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And yes, I would adore having a woman president of the United States. My choice would be Representative Barbara Lee, who alone voted in Congress five years ago not to make war on Iraq. That to me is leadership, morality, and courage; if she had been white I would have cheered just as hard. But she is not running for the highest office in the land, Mrs. Clinton is. And because Mrs. Clinton is a woman and because she may be very good at what she does, many people, including some younger women in my own family, originally favored her over Obama. I understand this, almost. It is because, in my own nieces&rsquo; case, there is little memory, apparently, of the foundational inequities that still plague people of color and poor whites in this country. Why, even though our family has been here longer than most North American families &mdash; and only partly due to the fact that we have Native American genes &mdash; we very recently, in my lifetime, secured the right to vote, and only after numbers of people suffered and died for it.</p>
<p>When I offered the word &#8220;Womanism&#8221; many years ago, it was to give us a tool to use, as feminist women of color, in times like these. These are the moments we can see clearly, and must honor devotedly, our singular path as women of color in the United States. We are not white women and this truth has been ground into us for centuries, often in brutal ways. But neither are we inclined to follow a black person, man or woman, unless they demonstrate considerable courage, intelligence, compassion and substance. I am delighted that so many women of color support Barack Obama -and genuinely proud of the many young and old white women and men who do.</p>
<p>Imagine, if he wins the presidency we will have not one but three black women in the White House; one tall, two somewhat shorter; none of them carrying the washing in and out of the back door. The bottom line for most of us is: With whom do we have a better chance of surviving the madness and fear we are presently enduring, and with whom do we wish to set off on a journey of new possibility? In other words, as the Hopi elders would say: Who do we want in the boat with us as we head for the rapids? Who is likely to know how best to share the meager garden produce and water? We are advised by the Hopi elders to celebrate this time, whatever its adversities.</p>
<p>We have come a long way, Sisters, and we are up to the challenges of our time. One of which is to build alliances based not on race, ethnicity, color, nationality, sexual preference or gender, but on Truth. Celebrate our journey. Enjoy the miracle we are witnessing. Do not stress over its outcome. Even if Obama becomes president, our country is in such ruin it may well be beyond his power to lead us toward rehabilitation. If he is elected however, we must, individually and collectively, as citizens of the planet, insist on helping him do the best job that can be done; more, we must insist that he demand this of us. {snip}<br/>

					<p>The fawning over Barack Obama reminds me of the past and still persistent adulation displayed by left-wingers towards former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau. When he became prime minister, women swooned. Liberals adored him. The nation was said to be besotted by his presence.</p>
<p>But what did Trudeau do to Canada? Introduced multiculturalism, which turned the country from two solitudes into numerous solitudes. Racked up the national deficit and debt to alarming proportions, leaving future politicians to clean up, and citizens to suffer from, the fiscal mess he created. He opened Canada&rsquo;s doors to mass third-world immigration in the 1970s, which combined with multiculturalism, has had alarming consequences. He sneered at the United States and the private sector, but he courted socialists and communists. He divided, not united, the country by robbing the West (even gave Westerners the finger once). And much, much more. In short, Trudeau was a disastrous prime minister from a practical and/or conservative viewpoint, although even now, liberals proclaim him as Canada&rsquo;s greatest leader ever.</p>
<p>I see a lot of Trudeau&rsquo;s qualities in Obama, based on Obama&rsquo;s track record as well as media and public adoration. If Americans want to know what Obama might do to America, then look at Trudeau&rsquo;s legacy on Canada. In fact, Obama might be far worse. An Obama presidency would mean no more &#8220;God Save America&#8221; - instead, you&rsquo;d need to sing &#8220;God Help America!&#8221;</p>

					<p><span class="caps">MLK </span>was a communist sympathizer who cheated on his <span class="caps">PHD </span>dissertation. The <span class="caps">FBI </span>recorded him having sexual relations with prostitutes in his hotel room the night before he was killed.  He used church funds to do so, and this is why a left-wing judge had to forbid anyone from opening his <span class="caps">FBI </span>file until 2027.</p>
<p>Mandela was a terrorist who was funded by communists.  He was caught with bomb making materials, which was why he was sent to prison. He&rsquo;s on Youtube actually singing songs about killing white Afrikaners.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say Obama is good company.</p>

					<p>Alice Walker&rsquo;s &#8220;Goddess of the Three Directions&#8221; must be dizzy and confused. Let me untangle this. White feminists, like all people, have an inbuilt tribal identity. Hence they tend prefer one of their own when choosing a Presidential candidate. This is natural and healthy. Walker&rsquo;s attempt to gull and hector them out of is the only sickness here.</p>

					<p>I think her and her Hopi elders ate a little too much peyote. <span class="caps">WOW,</span> I&rsquo;ve noticed alot of rhetoric like this about him lately. People are viewing him as a sort of American messiah, and when you read thier rationale it&rsquo;s almost the same things Germans said about Hitler, his oratorical skills and his presence move people. He has the swagger of an over paid black athlete, combined with with White inteligence, so he has our cognitive ability and a minority agenda, he is possibly the greatest threat to America since its conception. Somebody the other week posted that we need to start figuring out what we&rsquo;re going to do. I concur. I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out what I&rsquo;m going to do, on a personal level, we need to figure out what we&rsquo;re going to do as a group. I&rsquo;ve been looking into the various Free State movements (Wyoming/New Hampshire/Vermont), The South Carolina Christian migration, and the NorthWest Imperative, though I don&rsquo;t feel I share a common ideaology with any of them, though I share bits and pieces of all. Any suggestions?</p>

					<p>Alice Walker is another black african racist.  She is proof that black women are just as racist as black men.  Like basketball, they are the very best in the world in their &#8220;hate whitey&#8221; profession.  I&rsquo;m starting to see the light and believe we need to start promoting higher birth rates among white people.  We can&rsquo;t let these black racist animals continue to stalk and kill us.</p>

					<p> In all of the flap about &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Jeremiah Wright, everyone, or almost everyone, seems to be missing an equally pernicious influence on his worldview, Saul Alinsky. Alinsky is the cultural marxist whose organization Obama joined when he launched his career as a &#8220;community activist&#8221; straight out of law school(can you imagine any silk stocking law firm like Sidley and Austin allowing a recent white hire, as Obama was, to completely ignore money-making activities so he could pursue his yen to be an agitator and social revolutionary, all the while drawing a princely salary as a recent Ivy League law grad?). Hilary Clinton, coincidentally, almost joined Alinsky&rsquo;s organization after graduating from Wellesley, but choose to attend Yale Law School instead. He was her idol in college. Alinsky, in good cultural marxist fashion, encouraged his protege&rsquo;s to lie and otherwise decieve others to gain support and achieve the secret goals of the organization. Now you know why and how Obama learned to be so vague and noncommital on the campaign trail. But wait until he gets elected and the wrapping paper comes off!</p>

					<p>Oh, please, spare me.  I&rsquo;m so sick of listening to these disgusting crybabies whine as if they&rsquo;re the only ones who were ever exposed to any kind of perceived injustice it makes me utterly sick to my stomach.</p>
<p>She sounds as if she regards herself as some kind of intellect that has made good and wants people to know what adversity someone so great has had to suffer.</p>
<p>Is it arrogance that makes such a sub-standard mentality regard herself so highly?</p>
<p>Yes, it is, of course.  </p>
<p>And she doesn&rsquo;t have to tell us why she&rsquo;s voting for Obama because we already know.  And it is the same reason all blacks are voting for him:  They&rsquo;re white hating racists that become more hateful the more they&rsquo;re given.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a few of the videos of blacks applauding the preaching of anti-white hatred, and we&rsquo;ve seen the black masses applaud the black disseminators of evil and hate wherever they go, so what this vile woman contends is no mystery to any aware white person at this point.</p>
<p>Is it racism 200 years ago that prompts their racism and hate?</p>
<p>Not really, because none of them have suffered one iota under any kind of white oppression.</p>
<p>The reason is very simple.  Blacks hate whites because they can&rsquo;t compete with whites, and they can&rsquo;t succeed on the same level as whites in an advanced civilization in spite of the fact they&rsquo;re awarded jobs, positions and social benefits strictly on the basis of race.  Jealousy and envy are the fuel that propels their hate.</p>
<p>All their attempts at being successful in any of the sciences or professions have either proved fruitless or very limited.  So when they see whites succeeding all around them in business, academics and the sciences, and just about everything else that requires intelligence, they can&rsquo;t stand it really.  Limited in their mentality and therefore limited in their understanding, but being arrogant in spite of it, they conclude that whites get their positions through favoritism, knowing somebody, etc., and they conclude that whites in business succeed because they do dishonest things to get ahead, but all the while these same whites have oodles of time doing what they can &#8220;to keep the black man down.&#8221; </p>
<p>Black demogogic leaders and preachers reinforce their beliefs with fiery, lying rhetoric that is well within the area of hateful incitement to commit crimes and not within the boundries of free speech, yet, because they&rsquo;re black they get a pass for what whites would be arrested and tried in court for.</p>
<p>If they have a <span class="caps">HUGE </span>percentage of black males in prison, who failed to try in school because it is &#8220;acting white,&#8221; and they have a propensity for crime and violence, they condemn whites for the high incarceration rates.  It&rsquo;s never the fault of the black criminal who turns to crime, because he&rsquo;s too dumb to learn academically and refuses to learn a trade, because stealing and other crime pays better.</p>
<p>Everything is the fault of whites.  Everything.  And their rage grows.  And their Reverend Wrights, All Sharptons, Jesse Jacksons, Barack Obamas, Oprah Winfreys, Condoleeza Rices, all reinforce their pitiful beliefs that whitey is to blame for all their ills.  And their rage grows.</p>
<p>Only an imbecile would believe that a people who have had more than equal opportunities for the last 40 plus years have not succeeded because they got a late start due to slavery or racism, but that&rsquo;s the nonsense the black rank and file are fed, and they eagerly eat it up, because it provides them with an excuse for failing at everything so miserably.  It&rsquo;s not their lack of intelligence and ability that holds them back, it&rsquo;s whitey.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not their lack of intelligence.  It&rsquo;s not their propensity for crime and violence.  It&rsquo;s not their lack of effort put forth to learn a trade.  It&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>So if anybody were to conclude that nothing can be done to appease the black anti-white racists he would be right.  Nothing will appease this hateful population of people.  Nothing.</p>
<p>Whites could give them the entire country and leave and when they made a mess of things and imploded, don&rsquo;t worry, that would be whitey&rsquo;s fault too.</p>
<p>No nation will ever know peace, serenity and prosperity that has these primitive ingrates as citizens.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure that I want to base my life and actions on what the  Hopi elders have to say.  The Hopi have not been a very successful ethnic group.  It might not be a good idea to follow them.  You can go sit in the dirt and chant to your ancestors   &mdash;   for me, I&rsquo;ll put my faith in Western science, technology, and logic.</p>

					<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been looking into the various Free State movements (Wyoming/New Hampshire/Vermont), The South Carolina Christian migration, and the NorthWest Imperative, though I don&rsquo;t feel I share a common ideaology with any of them, though I share bits and pieces of all. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Posted by PincheGabacho at 8:27 PM on April 1&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes <span class="caps">PG,</span> I have a suggestion: Let&rsquo;s get up the the Northwest American Republic first, and worry about ideology later. After all, Whites&rsquo; ability to plan in advance is what will save us as a race. To advance our cause, we have to be alive first, set up with life&rsquo;s necessities second, and networked with others like ourselves third (in my opinion, loners in the middle of the woods are subject to being picked off one by one, like Randy Weaver).</p>
<p>And besides, who ever said you always have to agree with everybody else to be a contributing part of this movement, anyway?</p>
<p>The Northwest American Republic. An idea whose time has come.</p>

					<p>If Obama is like Mandela, everyone had better replace those US dollars with gold and silver bullion. Use anything left over to buy a generator, stockpile fuel, food, and water. And if you want to protect all those things from the marauding hordes pouring out of &#8220;urban&#8221; America, you better buy guns and ammo and link up with similar minded neighbors. South Africa is soon coming to a city near you.</p>

					<p>Americans are probably not very aware of this, but any Canadian of a certain age and demographic can&rsquo;t help but be struck by the remarkable similarities between Barak Obama and Pierre Trudeau. In the late 1960&rsquo;s Canadians were confused and disillusioned after a string of bad governments, like many Americans have been disillusioned by Bush and his failed war in Iraq. Canada was facing political terrorism by the <span class="caps">FLQ </span>and secessionism was becoming a real possibility in Quebec. (Quebec is not much smaller then the Confederacy was). Out of nowhere came Pierre Trudeau much like Obama. Trudeau&rsquo;s mother was an Anglophone, a member of the majority group much like Obama&rsquo;s mother was White, still for now, the majority in the <span class="caps">USA.</span> Trudeau&rsquo;s father died when he was young, much like Obama&rsquo;s father abandoned him when he was young too. Trudeau was accentless in both languages and <span class="caps">SEEMED </span>at ease in either culture, although he covertly identified with the French culture of his father, much as Obama identifies with the race of his father. Trudeau&rsquo;s basic slogan was &#8220;a new guy with new ideas&#8221;. Remind you of Obama with his &#8220;change&#8221; slogan? Trudeau had only entered political life three years earlier and had little practical experience but was pushed fast up the ladder by political hacks in the Liberal party who recognized that such a cultural hermophrodite would have broad appeal, very much like Democrat strategists saw the potential for broad support in a Mulatto like Obama too and gave him so much prominence in the 2004 convention. Trudeau paid lip-service to reconciliation and bridging the gap between the two historic communities in Canada, Anglo and Franco. &#8220;More room would be made in Canada for Francophones&#8221; was his mantra. This actually translated into offical bilingualism which basically made the federal bureaucracy an exclusive preserve for Francophones. Remind you of Affirmative Action like Obama supports and would likely expand? Trudeau was always long on promise and short on specifics while clearly harboring a secret ethnic agenda, much like I believe Obama does too. Trudeau was the worst prime minister Canada ever had. He deeply and permanently scarred the country. In 1968 Canadians bought a pig in a poke when they voted for Trudeau. They <span class="caps">THOUGHT </span>they were voting for reconciliation, ethnic peace and a better future, but they were wrong. Will Americans follow suit with Obama?</p>

					<p>Here is a link to a <span class="caps">FASCINATING </span>response to Alice Walker&rsquo;s letter endorsing Obama. It is from a disillusioned white female who had dedicated herself to black racial causes and was raped by a black man in return. She mentions how black males viewed the ditzy liberal white females who flocked to work for black causes as nothing more than objects for sexual exploitation.<br/>

Thanks, I know the NorthWest has alot of movements ranging from the far left to the far right, if only we could get the lefties to put as much energy into preserving thier race as they do whales and baby seals. The NorthWest also seems like it&rsquo;s an economicdally viable solution, so it looks like the NorthWest it is.</p>

					<p>Not only would Obama <span class="caps">BETRAY </span>the interests of <span class="caps">ALL</span> White Americans, he would equally betray the interests of <span class="caps">ALL</span> Black Americans. He is 100% <span class="caps">FOR OPEN BORDERS </span>and amnesty! Even though Blacks would be the first to feel the negative impact of <span class="caps">MORE </span>immigration   &mdash;   at least the under-educated, unskilled bottom-level workers. I am stunned by so many American Blacks not having enough intelligence to understand this. But then again, I guess it goes with what they are.</p>
<p>Obama is also <span class="caps">FOR </span>reparations. Meaning that vast amounts of taxes will be diverted to give Blacks an undeserved, unearned cash bonus. Which hand-out will surely have to be repeated every few years for the benefit of those not born in time to get this handout.</p>
<p>Do we want a lying phony like Obama as president? Do you really believe he&rsquo;s capable of effecting reconciliation between Blacks and Whites. Much less reducing the incredible amount of Black-on-White crime? If the answer is &#8220;NO&#8221;, then get busy and do your damndest to wake your friends and neighbors, your co-workers and relatives up   &mdash;   <span class="caps">BEFORE IT&rsquo;S TOO LATE</span>!</p>

					<p>This is exactly what I mean about Obama as the Candidate of Codpendency.</p>
<p>This article, its hyperbole, effusiveness, and over the top rhetoric, is a perfect example of how Obama is the symbol, not of hope, but of our collective soul sickness.  </p>
<p>One symptom of this sickness is Americas stubborn and stupid (sorry everyone, it&rsquo;s the nicest word I can think of at this moment) refusal to talk seriously about the number one problem facing us today. The collapse of the Family.</p>
<p>Whether that collapse is good or bad is another story; but it most definitely is having consequences.  The number one consequence is that it is effecting our ability to negotiate ourselves through the one thing that will never - <span class="caps">EVER </span>- go away, ie; <span class="caps">REALITY</span>!</p>
<p>Humans are socialized in the Family, <span class="caps">NOT </span>in &#8220;Race&#8221;.  So, the attitudes that people want so desperately to alter come from there, not from anywhere else.  We are SO scared to talk about ourselves, which is what a discussion on Family is really about, that we will do practically <span class="caps">ANYTHING </span>to avoid it.  And this is the reason Race is given <span class="caps">FAR </span>more attention that it really deserves.</p>
<p>The failure of the family, a complex issue that wont be explained away in a post at a Race Realist website, has produced a veritable Legion of the Lost.  A Nation of Codependents, as I call us.  Tied to the Codependency is massive addiction.  And <span class="caps">NOT </span>just to Drugs and Alcohol and Sex. But beliefs that we are convinced will redeem the world (I can not believe people still think this way). Addiction is about mood-altering so as to avoid reality.</p>
<p>Now, go back and read the article from this perspective.  I mean, doesn&rsquo;t she sound like she&rsquo;s high on something?</p>
