						<p>Scotland&rsquo;s population is at its healthiest level for more than 20 years thanks to a mini baby-boom which saw 57,000 births registered last year &mdash; one-third of them by Eastern European parents.</p>
<p>Figures released yesterday by the Registrar General Office for Scotland show there were more children born in 2007 than any year since 1997.</p>
<p>The increase of 2000 births on the previous year is the fifth annual increase in a row and was welcomed by the Scottish Government as a sign that initiatives to get Europeans to settle in Scotland had worked.</p>
<p>It marks a dramatic turnaround from four years ago when the then First Minister Jack McConnell labelled the falling population a &#8220;demographic timebomb&#8221; and the &#8220;biggest single challenge facing Scotland&#8221;.</p>
<p>Almost half of last year&rsquo;s babies were to mothers born in Scotland, said Registrar General Duncan Macniven. But one in three were to mothers born in the Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004.</p>
<p>At the same time the number of marriages fell, and is now nearing its lowest level since Victorian times. Some 49.1% of last year&rsquo;s births were to unmarried parents.</p>
<p>The new provisional statistics show a total of 57,781 births which, despite its 20-year peak, is well below the levels of the 1970s and 1980s, when they were well over 60,000 in most years.</p>
<p>The figures show that Scotland&rsquo;s population has steadily increased since 2003 when the population was 5.06 million. In 2006 it had risen to 5.12 million &mdash; the highest since 1985 &mdash; and all the signs are that there will be a further increase in 2007.</p>
<p>Four years ago, it was judged that Scotland&rsquo;s demographic decline was among the most chronic in Europe.</p>
<p>Based on trends, the Government Actuary expected numbers living in Scotland to dwindle, from 5,062,011 at the April 2001 census to below five million by 2009 and below four million in 2041. Its population had been falling for two decades and no region in the UK had a lower birth rate.</p>
<p>The fertility rate peaked at 3.1 births per woman at the height of the baby boom in 1964. By 1972, the rate had fallen below the key &#8220;replacement level&#8221; of 2.1. It slipped below 1.5 in 2001, making it the lowest of the four UK countries.</p>
<p>The total of 52,432 births recorded in 2003 was 712 more than in the preceding year, but half the number recorded in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>It drove Jack McConnell to unveil a website, scotlandistheplace.com, which was designed to sell the virtues of living and working in the country to potential migrants. It formed part of the Fresh Talent initiative, a drive launched in February, 2004 to encourage 8000 more skilled people annually to put down roots in Scotland.</p>
<p>A Scottish Government spokesman said there was a consensus that Fresh Talent worked and it was an initiative the SNP administration was keen on continuing.</p>
<p>Mr Macniven said: &#8220;The rise in the birth rate certainly paints a more positive picture for Scotland&rsquo;s population and, since this is the fifth annual increase in a row, it is not a short-term change.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rise in the birth rate, coupled with increased immigration, means that Scotland&rsquo;s population is projected to stay above the five million mark until the 2070s, instead of the 2030s as previously forecast.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t let the &#8216;white&rsquo; label fool you, alot of Eastern Europeans comming in are absolute thugs. They are easterners, not westerners. In such high numbers they dont assimilate either. But obviously there is more similarity than all the alien countries, especially Africa and Muslims. Let them build their own great societies.</p>

			<p>Actually, in Scotland as in much of the rest of the West, a disproportionate share of the &#8220;baby boom&#8221; comes from non-Scots  &mdash;   esp. Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis who are filling the place up.</p>
<p>This is another reason to be skeptical about statistics taken at face value, even more so for other countries.  Canada, Australia and England all have among the lowest birth rates in the Western world, but the authorities try to mitigate the crisis by claiming that total fertility is &#8220;average, around 1.5.&#8221;  What they *don&rsquo;t* tell you, of course, is that most of that extra fertility  &mdash;   and over half of new babies in much of Canada, England and Australia  &mdash;   are Somali, Zimbabwean, Pakistani, Sudanese, Indian or Vietnamese.  Even more so in the USA  &mdash;   fertility here is 1.9, one of the highest in the Western world, but when you study the numbers, you&rsquo;ll find that White birth rates in the USA are abysmally low especially in states like New York and California.  While African-American and Latino fertility rates are much higher.  IOW, we have a formula for a non-white majority and the dissolution of the USA.</p>
<p>The truth is, these countries are winding up with a demographically disastrous situation, because the White populations that founded their nations are being demographically overwhelmed.  No nation has ever survived such a demographic transition.  </p>
<p>White parents in countries like England, Australia, Canada and the USA know this fact well, which is why we&rsquo;re seeing so many waves of emigration these days.  One of my own neighbors, with 4 kids, moved his entire family down to Chile  &mdash;   in part because, as he himself told us, South American countries like Chile, Argentina and Uruguay are probably one of the most &#8220;European&#8221; places remaining in the world.</p>
<p>Within Europe itself, Sweden, Britain and France are all self-destructing demographically.  So that only a small band in a few small countries in Europe  &mdash;   such as Finland, Iceland, Denmark, Switzerland and Austria  &mdash;   along with probably Italy and Germany muddling through, will survive as Western countries.  White families from the besieged nations thus move to the countries which will retain their ethnic European character.  While England and, regrettably, Scotland, along with Australia, Canada and the USA, all go to the dogs.</p>

			<p>At least Eastern Europeans are White.  Maybe in a generation they&rsquo;ll speak with a Scottish burr and change their names to McKowalski.  I never thought, however, a Scotsman would have to be shamed into having more sex. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s happening all over Europe, Australia, and here in the U.S.  The Gov&rsquo;t. stats are incredibly misleading.  There are at least 320 million people here in the United States and the number of non-Hispanic Whites is about 200 million.  That translates to approximately 63% of the population - that&rsquo;s what we are - assuming &#8216;only&rsquo; 20 million illegals here now.  The tide is also increasing in both the illegal AND legal immigration.  The prediction that we are going to be a minority in 2050 is not accurate.  We are going to be a minority within 20 years or less - probably less - probably before 2025.  Of course they&rsquo;ll attempt to conceal it from us even then with more bogus statistics.  We need a mass awakening, and fast.</p>

<p>And they will soon learn to their horror the monstrous error they made by allowing non-whites into the country.</p>
<p>The Eastern Europeans are a BIG plus.  But the non-whites will cause them ungodly hardships in many, many ways.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see how having more white babies without being married will be good for any country or it&rsquo;s economy. Being unmarried and raising children seem to counteract one another. It seems that the less educated always have more children than the educated middle-upper classes of any society. More than likely the single mothers will be looking for hand-outs to help raise their children. There&rsquo;s more to consider that just the additional presence of more whites.</p>

			<p>What makes people have more children?  Nationalistic pride.</p>
<p>It gets them up in the morning, makes them put consistent effort in improving their lives, and encourages going the extra mile for family and community.</p>
<p>Healthy competition is inherent in nature.  The ethnic-national entities with the most vitality are those who want to progress and thrive in relation to those around them.  </p>
<p>If those neighbors seem to be stagnant or losing steam, that stimulates the aggressive, nationalist instincts even more.</p>

                          I seriously doubt that the Poles can out-thug the notorious drug and whisky soaked rabble of the tenements of Glasgow and Edinburgh - I doubt anyone nation on earth can.<br>
The schizophrenic, violent, murderous Glaswegian alcoholic or drug-abuser has been a stock British character for years.<br>
Just watch the film &#8216;Trainspotting&rsquo; for a very accurate portrayal.<br>

			<p>I suppose that&rsquo;s not all bad, but the Eastern Europeans aren&rsquo;t Scots, and it sounds like they plan to live on the dole.  One wonders how many are Gypsies, Muslims, and the like. As with all immigration, I wonder what they are running from.  The risk of people being wanted for criminal activity in their home countries seems great.<br>
It is true that many Eastern Europeans are of fine European stock.  However, I still think it would be better if they stayed and improved their own nations.  Though I know they&rsquo;ve faced rough post-Soviet times, most of these countries have alot going for them.  I would encourage people visiting Europe to check out Poland, Czech Republic, Croatia, and Slovenia especially.  These places are just beautiful, and full of great folks.  I hate to see them drained of their resources at this crucial point in their rebirth.  It&rsquo;s not fair to them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Almost half of last year&rsquo;s babies were to mothers born in Scotland, said Registrar General Duncan Macniven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;almost half&#8221;: lets call that (almost): 3 in 6</p>
<p>&#8220;But one in three were to mothers born in the Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004.&#8221;</p>
<p>lets call &#8220;one in three&#8221;: 2 in 6</p>
<p>If 3 in 6 are to mothers born in scotland and 2 in 6 are to mothers from &#8220;Eastern European&#8221; then it follows 1 in 6 births are to mothers who are neither Scotish born NOR Eastern European.</p>
<p>I do not see a lot to celebrate here - yes the Eastern Europeans are largely from north-eastern European Baltic states and are whites who are Christian, or perhaps I should say non-non Christian. ie atheist, agnostic, none of the above, etc. Of the &#8216;almost half&rsquo; who were born to mothers born in Scotland i frankly dread to think what proportion of them are non-white.</p>

			<p>Poland has always considered herself a part of the West.  The Poles are Roman Catholic, not Orthodox (eastern) Christianity.  They have a history that is deeply entwined with Germany, the Czechs and Lithuania, and Sweden.   They have never been ruled by the Ottaman empire, unlike much of the Balkans, so do not have fifth column of Moslems in their country.   If you watch the Olympic opening ceremonies the Polish team is among the most blond of any.  (At least were in 1976 the year I went)</p>

			<p>Keep Scotland Scottish!  Every nation requires an identity for its people to thrive.  Preferable as Eastern Europeans are to blacks or Muslims, they are still not Scots, bearing no allegiance.  Read Duncan Bruce&rsquo;s 1997 book, &#8220;The Mark of the Scots,&#8221; to understand the greatness of Scotty.    </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is good news at all; Eastern Europeans, while they may be &#8220;white&#8221; in the sense that they are caucasian, are not what Europe needs. Look at the kinds of societies they have built compared to the societies of the West. Scotland will not benefit from this compared to the way they would benefit from true Scottish-stock babies.  I admire the fact that eastern Europeans seem to still have some backbone to them, but beyond this, they are no kind of solution to the white West&rsquo;s problems.</p>

<p>Oh sure, and England is entirely populated by nice white gentlemen with upper-class accents who all wear bowler hats and pinstripes, their ladies staying at home to enjoy high-teas in between flower arranging, shopping at Harrods and ordering the maids around .</p>
<p>Hello! This is the 21st Century; you really have to let go of your out-dated stereotypes &#8220;John Broggan&#8221;. The tenements are long gone or were converted into upscale condos decades ago.</p>
<p>The Scots have historically been one of the most innovative races on earth with a quiet, understated influence world-wide, entirely disproportionate to her population. &#8220;Trainspotting&#8221; indeed&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this tendency for English people to denigrate the Scots recently (more than they always have, I mean). They  especially blame this &#8220;Scottish Government&#8221;. That&rsquo;s the spirit Brits, let&rsquo;s all fight amongst ourselves as our countries are being raped by this COMMUNIST government and its foreign footsoldiers&hellip;</p>

			<p>Here in Australia within the last two years, my wife (and I) have had two babies. And here in the North of Melbourne (one of many tradional immigrant area&rsquo;s here/blue collar and cheapish living).<br>
Both times we were the only white faces on the ward. Lots of (Red dot)Indians, Iraqi&rsquo;s, Pacific Islanders, Turks and Greeks&hellip;.all big family peoples i.e the P.Is had five and Indians were popping out there fourth.<br>
We were the only patients who didn&rsquo;t need a translator.<br>
At my last company our translators cost $70 an hour.<br>
And the nurses/midwives sincerely looked relieved to be able to communicate to us directly.<br>
And the Australian Government has been bragging lately that our recent baby boom has gotten the birth rate up to nearly 2.0 children per woman.<br>
Likewise there&rsquo;s little mention of who or what are producing the babies.<br>
Society is being dragged down for the lowest common denominator.<br>
Both my grandfathers fought in WW2 (One in NZ Army the other British) for a combined total of 8 years.<br>
And this is the freedom they fought for, it sucks.<br>
I don&rsquo;t think we are all equal.  </p>

<p>Yes,Uruguay, Chilie, and Argentina have a stronger European culture that the U.S.  In fact, I read that Uruguay is at least 80% caucasian - at least 17% more that the U.S.</p>

			<p>The Eastern European bashing on this website is appalling. The  Poles are as European as anybody, and what is more Poland is rapidly catching up to Western Europe so that they will eventually probably have a mass return of Poles to their homeland the way the Irish have returned in droves following the Celtic Tiger boom of the 1990s. </p>

<p>I disagree.  It is the US (and maybe Canada unless they get their act together) that&rsquo;s headed for demographic destruction.  All the other countries you&rsquo;ve mentioned have White populations in excess of 92% or more. I&rsquo;ve been reading alot of stories about birth rates ticking up in European countries and it&rsquo;s not from nonwhite immigrants either.  Scotland, Russia, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovakia and France (which just reached replacement level fertility).  Scotland, by the way, is 98% White.  I&rsquo;m not all that happy that a huge chunk of their births are to Eastern Europeans.  I have nothing against them but I think once you break down a country&rsquo;s ethnic homogenity, even with White immigrants, it opens the door for undesirables from Africa and Asia. Even England, whose immigration is radically different from the continent, with its disgusting mix of post colonial refugees, is in better shape than the US.  I&rsquo;m confident Europe will survive while the US probably only has a couple of decades left. </p>

			<p>There is something very wrong with these figures.There are, at most, 100 thousand East Europeans in Scotland. The population of Scotland is 5.2 million. Do the maths. 100 thousand people account for a third of all births!! </p>
<p>I think Benefit (Welfare) fraud is playing a large, but unacknowledged, part here. Mothers get Maternity Grants and of course child Benefit. I would like to know how many of these babies remain in Scotland.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this will happen.  It would mean rewriting their racial classifications so that Asians would no longer exist as a group in the US.  What they will do is continue hiding the declining White population by classifying all the growing hispanic numbers as &#8220;White&#8221;.  Every few years they lump all hispanics who don&rsquo;t check &#8220;Black&#8221; on the box into the &#8220;White&#8221; category.  Then, mysteriously, they take them out and only count hispanics who check &#8220;White&#8221;.  Probably only a third of these people are White.  This game has been going on for 15 years now.    </p>

			<p>This is not actually good news. Eastern Europeans are not what the West needs  &mdash;  just look at the kinds of societies they build. Amrenners everywhere are praising and congratulating the Russians for their hard-nosed attitude towards immigrants and their reproductive success as of late, but anyone who knew anything about Russia would know that criminality, barbarity, and frankly a lack of wits characterizes Russians and eastern Europeans about as well as they do the Muslims that are over-running the West. While they may be technically Caucasian, they are not what has made the white race great. At best, I commend them for their resolve to fight immigration, but anyone who thinks that they are going to carry on the legacy of white accomplishment and dignity is pretty far off the mark. What we really need is a birth surge among the indigenous Westerners (English, Germans, Dutch, French, Italians, Belgians, Danes, Scots, etc.) and for them to follow the eastern European example of anti-immigration, but nothing more and nothing less.</p>

<p> You fail to take into consideration history. The eastern Europeans never received the benefits of Roman civilization. They were too far away. The Russians were threatened for many centuries by the Mongols and many other Asians. This wasn&rsquo;t their fault. Consider the devastation caused by WW2. How was it Russia&rsquo;s &#8220;fault&#8221; that Germany invaded their country and devastated it?</p>

			<p>Well I love Eastern Europeans. Id prefer Scotland stay Scottish, but any white nation staying white, in any form, is acceptable to me now. </p>

			<p>This is a good thing.  At least they get the flaming multiculturists off their back. They can say &#8220;see, we&rsquo;re being good world citizens by letting in the disadvantaged of other countries.&#8221;  Fortunately for them, these disadvantaged happen to be white Europeans.  Look at it this way - for every White Eastern European they let in, that&rsquo;s one Arab or Black African they don&rsquo;t have to let in. </p>
