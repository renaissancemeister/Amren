						<p>Concerned immigrant groups say Canada could lose its rich history of multiculturalism and ethnic diversity if proposed amendments are made to the country&rsquo;s immigration law. </p>
<p>Sima Sahar Zerehi of the group Status Now says some visible minorities &mdash; who surpassed five million in number in the latest census &mdash; fear changes being proposed by Ottawa could result in immigrants being discriminated against and denied entry into Canada. </p>
<p>She says well-established immigrant communities would then shrink instead of grow and some ethnic cultures could eventually disappear from Canadian society. </p>
<p>The proposed legislation would give the federal government power to fast-track certain types of applicants while refusing to even consider others. </p>
<p>Immigration Minister Diane Finley has said the amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act would help attract highly sought after skilled workers, who often give up on Canada as a destination because of long backlogs. </p>
<p>Finley has declined to speculate about which immigration categories could be banished to the lower rungs of the priority list. </p>
<p>Zeheri, who is Iranian and came to Canada as a refugee, says she&rsquo;s also concerned because the Conservatives included the immigration measures in its larger budget-implementation bill. </p>
<p>The budget bill is a confidence matter that would trigger an election if the opposition parties voted it down. </p>
<p>Zeheri says she&rsquo;s worried the Liberals will not vote against the immigration amendments because they don&rsquo;t want to face an election any time soon. </p>
<p>Victor Wong of the Canadian-Chinese National Council says the government should withdraw the proposed amendments for now, release a discussion paper outlining why it wants to change the legislation, and then consult ethnic communities before going any further. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been the process in the past,&rdquo; Wong said at a hearing of the House of Commons&rsquo; Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration in Toronto on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Rich history?  In the artistic depiction of the signing of the Articles of Confederation in 1867, with John A. Macdonald being the most prominent figure, I looked in vain for any South Asians, black Caribbeans, Chinese, Amerindians.</p>

<p>This is not bad news for rank-and-file Canadians; rather, it constitutes good news! Going to Vancouver or Toronto is much like going to a foreign city - it doesn&rsquo;t even feel like you&rsquo;re in Canada, or North America for that matter. If these immigration amendments will help turn back the clock to the days when you could go anywhere in Canada and easily relate to, and communicate with, your fellow citizens, then I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>

			<p>Amazing that there are any complaints whatsoever from pressure groups on this legislation, since it follows Canada&rsquo;s time-honored trend of 1. passing supposedly restrictive immigration legislation and then 2. utterly ignoring any such restrictions thanks to the hundreds of loopholes always built into it, then 3. finding some way to triple the number of immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean and SE Asia to boost Canada&rsquo;s &#8220;diversity&#8221; a bit more.  This has already happened half a dozen times since the 1980&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s real problem is that it has a white birth rate of 1.1-1.2  &mdash;   one of the lowest anywhere among the already-paltry numbers of the rest of the Western world.  And rather than allowing the situation to stabilize over a generation, Canada is busily replacing its founding population with the Third World.  Even worse, Canada&rsquo;s PC self-censorship on the issue of &#8220;visible minorities&#8221; is even more intolerable than the suffocating PC in Australia and Britain, quite a feat in itself.  </p>
<p>Most Canadians I know have emigrated from that icebox to countries like Italy, Greece, Austria or Germany especially if they have ancestral links, or in line with the trends these days, to one of the solidly white South American countries like Chile or Uruguay.  Nobody in their right mind wants to pay sky-high Canadian taxes and deal with Canada&rsquo;s stifling PC, to effectively subsidize their own state-sponsored demographic replacement.  They certainly don&rsquo;t want to raise their kids there.</p>

&hellip;instead of the WHITE people shrinking and eventually disappearing, as she would obviously prefer. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t grow one group without shrinking the pre-existing one. Your gain is my loss. An unfortunate fact of life on Planet Earth that liberals stupidly and disastrously continue to ignore. </p>
<p>Trouble is, them fighting to grow THEIR ethnic groups is always lauded in the press as &#8220;empowerment.&#8221; But when my people talk about growing OUR ethnic group, we&rsquo;re always the evil downpressors guilty of something-or-other and therefore DESERVING of being displaced, the Eurocentric colonists who invented slavery and racism and meanness and sexism and homophobia and etc, etc, etc&hellip; <br/>

<p>This says it all! She shouldn&rsquo;t be concerned about anything in our country other than providing for herself and her own family until she has proven her loyalties to Canada and not other people like herself unless she harbors a <i>5th columinst mentality</i> like so many other recent arrivals who lobby for more of their own kind. </p>
<p>We generously opened our doors to this foreign refugee and offered her sanctuary along with (most likely) a monthly welfare check, courtesy of working Canadian taxpayers, and now this uninvited guest positions herself to censure her host benefactors when it relates to <i>our</i> Canadian immigration policy.</p>
<p>If her home country of Iran was a benevolent refugee-receiving nation similar to Canada, and I as Canadian citizen was offered sanctuary and then began a campaign of critical review of <i>their</i> policies, I would be deported immediately after being &#8220;<i>rigorously disciplined</i> for being so boldly rude and disrespectful. </p>

<p>Diversity was all about minorities saying &#8220;We not like you white people.&#8221; We agree, its time to go home, soon, I hope.</p>

			<p>France elected Sarkozy. Germany elected Merkel. Canada elected Harper. Switzerland elected&hellip;who was that guy? Italy just elected Berlusconi. Progress is slow, and sometimes it&rsquo;s 2 steps forward, 1.9 steps back, but we&rsquo;re coming around to our sanity, if a little too slow for my taste. I don&rsquo;t think Republicans are going to get hit as hard this fall as we may have feared, with a radical far-left racist at the top of the Democratic ticket.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting link. It&rsquo;s an open borders Canadian group called &#8220;Status Now.&#8221; </p>
<p>http://statusnow.org/content/view/11/4/</p>
<p>Notice the names of the people involved:</p>
<p>Victor Wong<br/>
Mohamed Boudjenane<br/>
Pedro Barata<br/>
Vilma Filici<br/>
Raj Dhaliwal<br/>
Ali Naqvi<br/>
Sima Sahar Zerehi<br/>
Naveen Mehta<br/>
Angie Rupra<br/>
Maita Sayo</p>
<p>Yep, good &#8216;ole fashioned Canadian names like &#8220;Ali Naqvi&#8221; and &#8220;Pedro Barata.&#8221; Of course no racism is involved in this conquest of the Anglo-Gallic nation of Canada. We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that all of these good folks would be as actively and wholeheartedly involved in their open borders jihad if the immigrants were all coming from Poland and Denmark.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism&#8221; and &#8220;Diversity&#8221; are agendas that whites are supposed to pay homage to that are against their own self-interests.  The flip side of &#8220;Multiculturalism&#8221; and &#8220;Diversity&#8221; are the gains of racial/ethnic power interests who simply want the gain an advantage over, and eventually dominate the white population.</p>
<p>Put it this way; if you are white please inform me what other racial/ethic group would you believe would treat you and your family well if they were dominant power structure over your race.  Blacks?, Hispanics?, Chinese?, Indians? Muslims?.  There would be no &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; or similar policies for the whites, rather, they would bleed you for whatever resources they desire, and eventually over generations eliminate you all without so much as a tear in their eye.</p>
<p>And the white Canadians better wake up to that fact before that is their fate.</p>

<p>Either these &#8220;well-established&#8221; communities must be single-gendered or they need a good course in sex education. Well-established communities do not shrink, nor do they eventually disappear. This is certainly contrary to all the information I have on the birth rate amoung immigrants. Even if the immigrant communities are all men, there is no shortage of native Canadian girls that will mate with immigrants. (I guess that is what they mean when they say Canadians are the &#8220;nice Americans&#8221;.) </p>

<p>Laughable, utterly laughable!</p>
<p>If Canada&rsquo;s laws are going to be so odious to the Sima Sahar Zerehi types of this world, then let them get out. Punish the whites of Canada Comrade Zerehi, for their lack of understanding with regards to &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let Canada become a society so bleached in whiteness, that it makes Quebec province look French Vanilla only!</p>

			<p>Too bad her, (Zerehi), fears are not very realistic. The politicians are constantly talking about these so-called amendments that never see the light of day. It&rsquo;s going to take more than just some proposed bill to make this country right again, so I don&rsquo;t know why the MSM keeps throwing these little glimpses of hope out there. </p>

			<p>If white Canadians are waking up, it&rsquo;s happening so slowly and grudgingly that I see no basis for optimism. While the (neo-)conservative Harper has been elected, it&rsquo;s only with a minority government, and Canadians seem determined to deny him a majority even though he&rsquo;s governed pretty well and even though his opponent, Liberal Stephane Dion, is a national joke. Thirty years of liberal occupation in academia and government have left too many white Canadians with a sincere, if whacko belief that a Conservative majority would place the country in the hands of jackbooted fascists. As for the ever-growing immigrant population, they&rsquo;ll vote for anyone who will keep the doors wide open, and for no one else.</p>

<p>Those who promote multiCULTuralism are the ones who exacerbate these problems. Their &#8216;solution&rsquo; is to add to the problem the same conditions that caused the problem. Hence, the problems only get worse. Does anyone know of a place where every measure of quality of life improved with the introduction of racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity?</p>

			<p>Instead of &#8220;consulting&#8221; with the usual suspects, ie: the immigration industry, various ethnic/racial interest groups, how about the goverment consult the one group that has NEVER been consulted on the racial transformation of our country: the descendants of the founding European peoples who built Canada. It we, the founding peoples of this country, who are most affected by the race replacement policies of the hostile elites and their clients.</p>
<p>Sadly, said descendants of the founding peoples are, as I have said in previous posts, so brainwashed and passive, and/or cowardly, that they will not stand up to the elites and their third-world clients- even if they are aware of the onrushing train of racial and cultural extinction.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most of the sheeple would still probably, albeit weakly, protest their replacement if they were consulted. They would use economic arguments instead of cultural and racial arguments, of course. The worst thing in the world in weak, White Kanada is still the prospect of being called some PC pejoritive like the tired &#8220;racist&#8221; lable.</p>
