						<p>BRAMPTON &mdash; In a joke making the rounds of this city northwest of Toronto, a man wearing a turban arrives in India. At customs, the officer asks the man, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; &#8220;Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is that?&#8221; asks the customs official.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s in Brampton.&#8221;</p>
<p>Statistics Canada yesterday reported that the South Asian population of Brampton has more than doubled &mdash; from 63,205 South Asians in 2001 to 136,750 in 2006. Brampton, which grew by 33% during the period, now counts 57% &#8220;visible minorities,&#8221; including 8,000 Chinese, 53,000 Blacks, 12,000 Filipinos and 9,000 Latin Americans.</p>
<p>Today Brampton is the third most diverse city in Canada, behind Markham, and Richmond, B.C. The biggest visible minority in Brampton is white people.</p>
<p>In addition to the numbers, the rate of growth has been significant: The visible minority population grew by 89% here between 2001 and 2006, and that is on top of the 63% growth in the previous census period &mdash; an incredibly rapid pace of demographic change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically we&rsquo;ve been pushed out by the minorities,&#8221; Rob Moodie said yesterday, stopping by the Flour of Scotland bakery on Queen Street in Brampton for a fern tart.</p>
<p>Mr. Moodie&rsquo;s family owned this bakery for 50 years through to 1999. By the cash register, the bakery offers the free newspaper of one of Brampton&rsquo;s dwindling ethnic groups: The British Canadian, &#8220;Ontario&rsquo;s only newspaper for the 1.2 million British community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brampton today is changing so fast that its institutions cannot keep pace. There was just one turban evident yesterday when Brampton city council sat for its weekly meeting. Every other councillor is white.</p>
<p>Three of Brampton&rsquo;s four Members of Parliament are South Asians, as are all three of its members in the provincial legislature, but without a party ticket on which to run, South Asians have had less luck locally.</p>
<p>The lone Sikh councillor, Vicky Dhillon, won election here in 2006 after driving a limousine at Pearson International Airport. Today he has a mission: to integrate the South Asian population.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying to build a bridge between the minorities and the city of Brampton,&#8221; Mr. Dhillon said. He and fellow councillor John Sanderson, who call themselves brothers, a few weeks ago got 200 tickets to the Brampton Battalions Ontario Hockey League game &mdash; worth $12 each &mdash; to bring South Asians out to the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;South Asians don&rsquo;t want to bring their kids out, they don&rsquo;t know what ice hockey is,&#8221; Mr. Dhillon said of the effort. &#8220;We have to start from scratch.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said many South Asians keep their kids out of hockey, fearing the boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; long hair won&rsquo;t fit under a helmet. &#8220;They can wear a pony tail,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanderson was born in Brampton, one of 13 kids who grew up on a farm that is now Shoppers World. He remembers the Brampton of his youth, with two downtown dairies that took in farmers&rsquo; milk and sold ice cream, and a German place that smoked sausage. Even 10 years ago when he moved into his downtown Brampton condo, he could see eight corn silos from his window; now he can see just one. The rest is housing.</p>
<p>He said the ethnic mix is working quite well overall. &#8220;Our kids and their kids are going to the schools together,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The younger generation seems to mix more quickly than ours do.&#8221;</p>
<p>When South Asians went to the hockey game, &#8220;the &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know what you want to call them, I don&rsquo;t want to say &lsquo;White Folks&rsquo; &mdash; the mainstream, really appreciated it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane Badets, a director at Statistics Canada in Ottawa, said South Asians have clustered together in Brampton for three reasons: jobs, community and family.</p>
<p>But Mr. Dhillon and Mr. Sanderson worry that such concentration is unhealthy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to teach our kids what is Canada, because they are not going to go back,&#8221; Mr. Dhillon said. &#8220;If you want to think about the future of Canada, long term, then all the South Asians clustering together is not a good sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;The feds should do something. If new immigrants come, there should be restrictions for a few years. They should move to Saskatchewan or Manitoba. Those are provinces that need manpower.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back at the Flour of Scotland, baker Hazel Angus, herself an immigrant from Scotland in 1968, returned to her ovens. She was preparing a wholesale shipment to Orangeville, a town north of here to which many Scots have moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as they leave me alone and don&rsquo;t bother me, I don&rsquo;t mind,&#8221; she said of Brampton&rsquo;s more recent arrivals.<br/>

			<p>It&rsquo;s probably a hate crime in Canada even to write these words in a Canadian publication.</p>
<p><i>But Mr. Dhillon and Mr. Sanderson worry that such concentration is unhealthy.  &ldquo;We need to teach our kids what is Canada, because they are not going to go back,&rdquo; Mr. Dhillon said. &ldquo;If you want to think about the future of Canada, long term, then all the South Asians clustering together is not a good sign.  &ldquo;The feds should do something.

<p>If Canada is going to have diversity, it&rsquo;s better that they&rsquo;re clumped in their own areas.  That way, there&rsquo;s somewhere for whites to flee.</p>

<p>Absolutely not! We&rsquo;ll concede the city of Brampton as being conquered territory, but we want to keep some of our provinces majority white, so stay where you are. The CBC program called &#8220;Little Mosque on the Prairies&#8221; is not going to be your inroad to our western provinces.</p>

			<p>Same will soon be said of every Western nation or city. The rule seems to be that non-white countries should remain indigeous, while white westerners need to shove aside for non-white third world uneducated masses. Hello White people, we are slowly but surely losing a homeland. And we are graciously a wimpishly allowing it.</p>

			<p>Predictions based on history.</p>
<p>1) The Asians will mix relatively peacefully with &#8216;old&rsquo; Brampton.<br/>
2) Some of the Hispanics will mix peacefully with &#8216;old&rsquo; Brampton.<br/>
3) The Africans will never mix peacefully and prosperously with &#8216;old&rsquo; Brampton.  </p>

			<p>Whites are a minority in many cities nowadays, and not just Brampton, Ontario. Try the rest of Canada. Go to the United States. Australia. New Zealand. Western Europe. You&rsquo;ll quickly realize that Brampton is far from being an exception.</p>

			<p>&#8220;South Asians have clustered together in Brampton for three reasons: jobs, community and family.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a first. An article about race that doesn&rsquo;t discuss racism? I would pick three other reasons: racism, racism and racism. That&rsquo;s what it would be, if something similar were to be done by &#8216;whatyoumacallems&rsquo; - white folks. Perhaps he fumbled because he couldn&rsquo;t find a word for whites that wasn&rsquo;t &#8216;racists&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When people of color promote their own, it&rsquo;s called &#8216;a rapid pace of demographic change&rsquo;, and &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s called when whites dare even think about it&hellip;</p>

			<p>About the only place that is more than 80% white nowadays are the areas outside major cities in white nations.  Try and find a city in a non-white country where the white population is more than 20% of the total (outside of a couple of mega-wealthy cities such as Dubai).  Somehow it is rationalised that to see a vast majority of Asian/black/semitic faces when travelling overseas is normal, but to see a vast majority white population in our countries is something evil and to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>Well, just like what traditional European Americans have allowed in the states, there is only one thing to say,&#8221;cry me a river&#8221;. This is what happens when people who had all of the power just threw it all away. Cry me a river.</p>

			<p>Any dissent from the despised but thankfully dissapearing non elite Whites about The Plan will be punished unmercifully by the organs of the State. Our glorious Human Rights Commissions will comb the country for any enemies of the Multicultural Peoples of Kanada and crush their vile Whiteness out of existance. No thoughtcrime will go unpunished or unnoticed. Now go back to sleep!</p>

			<p>Sorry but the conspiracy is comming from the white left wing politically correct media. I would like to ask all of you Amren people as to what you are practically and realistically do about black violent culture in USA and Canada. I hear rants and raves on Amren but don&rsquo;t see anything on mainstream media. Focus get the word out, I was talking to some white friends this evening and they said they were worried about race riots, so I asked what they were waiting for a situation like South Africa. I am not advocating supressing blacks Iam wanting truth be told about crime rates factually with no editorialising. I am afraid that the civilised world( in which I include most Asians) is afraid and will capitulate and the whole world will be South Africa. </p>

			<p>Basic Question&hellip;.ISNT 300 MILLION ENOUGH? In 1970 USA had 180 Million..now in 30 years its almost doubled. Every empty beautiful space of our childhoods is GONE filled up with strip malls, trailer parks, low rent shopping centers. Traffic jams are now a fundamental force in our lives like food and water, consuming hours of our daily lives. With the overcrowding has come increased crime, lack of common civility, pollution, mental and physical stress.</p>
<p>We dont need ANY kind of immigration period. Let alone 25 millon<br/>
illegals with 4th grade educations whose only skill is making babies.</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Neither is 53,000 blacks, or white being a minority.  </p>
<p>I wonder what life in Africa would be like if large numbers of whites were to bless it&rsquo;s nations with such diversity,  to the point of making a minority of blacks there. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry!  The many Mongoloid related tribes will be doing that soon enough in place of the whites.  ROLF.</p>
<p>I read not long ago, the Chinese are perfecting a biological weapon targeted at the genes responsible for racial differentiation.  </p>
<p>Judging from their past record on autocratic rule and complete contempt for the rights and wellbeing of their own people, they&rsquo;ll have no besitation in unleashing such weapons on any ethnic group who gets in their way.  </p>
<p>The beauty of the act in their eyes will be that nobody will be able to prove who the criminals were that did the deed. <br/>

			<p>To respond to Mr. Dhillon&rsquo;s brilliant statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The feds should do something. If new immigrants come, there should be restrictions for a few years. They should move to Saskatchewan or Manitoba. Those are provinces that need manpower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No need to worry, Mr. Dhillon; at least where Manitoba is concerned.  The provincial government is way ahead of the Feds.</p>
<p>In fact, Manitoba premier Gary Doer recently travelled directly to the Philippines to seek new workers for the province&rsquo;s rumored labour shortage.  There was no sense in him going to Europe to find workers, right?</p>
<p>In the category of mother tongue, Tagalog has already surpassed Ukrainian, and is about to surpass German, as the official language for people of said nationalities living in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Having worked for a company that hired dozens of Filipinos, I can tell you first-hand, it was a total nightmare.  One extra dime off the paycheques of these people causes an incident.  I kid you not.  I can also tell you this will mean an increase in the number of salary statements issued to workers&hellip;for the purposes of bringing family over from the Philippines.  Because of these people, I steer right clear of job opportunities in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>Last but not least, it will invariably mean more votes for the NDP government in Manitoba.  </p>
<p>Therefore, if all else fails, Mr. Dhillon can always direct the next wave of Asian invaders to the Yukon.  </p>
<p>As for Mr. Sanderson, I&rsquo;m sure all these South Asian kids are going to become the next generation of Canadian hockey players and curlers.  Hey Mr. Sanderson; people from Russia, Czech Republic, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland know what ice hockey is.</p>
<p>Are they not worth a try?<br/>
