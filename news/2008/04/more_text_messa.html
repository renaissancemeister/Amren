<h1>More Text Messages Revealed in Detroit Mayor Sex Scandal</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corey Williams, AP, April 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A series of often explicit text messages from Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick&rsquo;s former chief of staff appear to show she had a long-term romantic relationship with the mayor and that he played a role in the firing of a police officer who sued the city.</p>
<p>The embarrassing messages between Kilpatrick and Christine Beatty from 2002 and 2003 appear in an 18-page document released Tuesday on the orders of Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Robert J. Colombo Jr. in response to a lawsuit by the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News.</p>
<p>The document was obtained from the computer of Michael Stefani, an attorney who represented three police officers in whistle-blowers&rsquo; lawsuits against the city that were settled last year for $8.4 million. The text messages were taken from Beatty&rsquo;s city-issued pagers.</p>
<p>The messages could prove damaging to Kilpatrick and Beatty, who are accused of lying under oath in one of the lawsuits by denying they had an intimate relationship. They are charged with perjury, misconduct and obstruction of justice. Both have denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The document released Tuesday includes descriptions of sexual trysts, the frequent use of the N-word by the mayor and Beatty as a term of endearment, and discussions of marriage.</p>
<p>On Sept. 15, 2002, Beatty described a sex act she wanted to perform on the mayor but said she didn&rsquo;t know how to approach him about it. He replied: &#8220;Next time, just tell me to sit down, shut up and do your thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>Later that month, the pair appeared to arrange a sexual encounter in Beatty&rsquo;s office. On Sept. 19, 2002, Beatty wrote to Kilpatrick: &#8220;I have wanted to hold you so badly all day, but I was trying to stay focused on work. So, I promise, not to keep you longer than 15 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kilpatrick replied: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t promise (N-word.)&#8221;</p>
<p>Beatty said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m in my office. Do you want me to come to yours or you coming to mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kilpatrick said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m coming down there &hellip; LOL ditto. Freaky Chris!&#8221;</p>
<p>The text messages also appear to show Kilpatrick was involved in the decision to fire one of the former officers, former Deputy Chief Gary Brown, which Kilpatrick also denied under oath as part of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>In a text message Beatty sent to Kilpatrick on May 15, 2003, that was contained in the document released Tuesday, she said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry that we are going through this mess because of a decision that we made to fire Gary Brown.&#8221;</p>
