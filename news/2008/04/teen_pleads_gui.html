<h1>Teen Pleads Guilty to Intimidating &#8216;Jena 6&rsquo; Marchers</h1>
									<div align="left">
						<i>CNN, April 26, 2008</i></font> 
					</div>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A teenager pleaded guilty Friday to a federal hate crime of threatening and intimidating civil rights marchers near Jena, Louisiana, last year by displaying hangman&rsquo;s nooses from the back of a pickup truck.</p>
<p>Federal authorities announced Friday that Jeremiah Munsen, 18, of Colfax, Louisiana, admitted that he placed two large nooses on his truck on September 20.</p>
<p>They said Munsen, along with an unidentified teen passenger, drove repeatedly past a group of marchers gathered at a bus depot in Alexandria &mdash; about 35 miles south of Jena, where the marches took place &mdash; as they awaited buses to return them to Tennessee.</p>
<p>I-Reporter Casanova Love, 26, was visiting his family in Louisiana and said he witnessed the event and sent a photograph of the truck to CNN.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the police had not stepped in, I fear what might have happened,&#8221; Love said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The defendant used a noose to threaten peaceful civil rights marchers who were in Louisiana to rally against racial intolerance,&#8221; said Acting Assistant Attorney General Grace Chung Becker.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Munsen, who faces up to a year in prison, will be sentenced at an August 15 hearing.</p>

			<p>Were these Jena protesters really that peaceful?</p>
<p>If Munsen would have done this alone, and not have admitted anything to anyone, then the Federal prosecutor would have to prove that he had bad intent.  Which would have been difficult.</p>

			<p>2 against 10,000?  Sounds like the scales are balanced on that one.  The kid will get the book thrown at him.  Well, we all know Freedom of Speech has been gone for years if not decades.  The kid should have pulled two flaming U.S. flags from his truck.  That one is allowed and sometimes even encouraged.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have been insulted if he did burn the flag because the flag represents nothing but the oppression, displacement, and swindling of white people these days.  Make that white sheep.</p>

			<p>His biggest mistake was pleading guilty to this ridiculous charge. Being young and naive did not serve him well when up against the massive machinery of the new totalitarian state whose intent is to stamp out any non-violent freedom of speech or expression. </p>
<p>One way of combating this charge would have been organizing a country-wide display of thousands of nooses in public places. They can&rsquo;t charge us all! </p>

			<p>Liberals have no sense of humor, about themselves.  If they read the Jared Taylor slipped on a banana peel, it&rsquo;s good for a half hour belly laugh.  But poke fun of the Stepin Fetchit blacks pretending to be scarred to death of a nose and that&rsquo;ll get you a year in jail and about $50,000 in legal fees.  </p>
<p>Leading the witch burning mob is herself a minority, Acting Assistant Attorney General Grace Chung Becker.  Ms Chung will make sure the misguided adult, he&rsquo;s white so he doesn&rsquo;t qualify as a youth as the black attackers do, feels the full might of the US government.  </p>
<p>Jeremiah Munsen violate only one law, the first law of race mixing: Nothing good can happen to you when you mix with blacks<br>

			<p>It certainly is a good thing the police stepped in, otherwise, Mr. Munson may have been hanged by the bunch of &#8220;peaceful&#8221; protestors, or beaten to death. He, {Munson}, was the only one in danger. The facts being known, far more whites than blacks, have been hanged by the neck until dead. A poor choice of intimidation, a help wanted poster would have been far more effective, for these unemployed freeloaders. </p>

			<p>Awwww, did he hurt their poor widdle feelings? I don&rsquo;t get this. He&rsquo;s up on charges simply because he drove past the crowd with a couple of knotted ropes hanging out of the back of his truck? Am I missing something here??? Surely there is more to the story than this. I hope our society hasn&rsquo;t gone THAT mad. </p>
<p>Growing up in Gary, Indiana at a time when the city was &#8220;changing&#8221;, I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of times I have been intimidated by blacks. None of them were ever brought up on charges.</p>

			<p>Grace Chung Becker?  That&rsquo;s one Chinese that is not an asset to the country.  One of the reasons to oppose immigration is that most of the immigrants have no sense of Anglo-Saxon rights or immunities.  I once went to a bank to exchange some dollars for euros.  The immigrants behind the counter wanted a bunch of information, which I refused.  I went instead to American Express and paid for the privilege of doing a simple transaction privately, with a nice German woman who cared only that my dollars were real.  </p>

<p>Yeah, a black person, one of many, way too many, blacks, that is to say, A CROWD OF BLACK PEOPLE, and two white fellas in a pick up truck, and he - Casanova Love (my God where do they get those names) - is afraid. </p>
<p>They are insane. They are serious too.  They expect us to believe them.  And to think it can get worse.  Of course it can. They are NEVER going to change.  Never going to stop, ever. They are intellectual, psychological, emotional, spiritual deformities who are being placed above criticism.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;Jenacide 6&#8221; nearly beat a white brother to death.  Thousands of racist black marchers and their racist black preachers descended to march for the Jenacide 6.  These Mugabean racists are alive and well in America!  Unless we protest and march and demand that they quit abusing our civil rights, they will continue their genocide.</p>

			<p>It has nothing to do with him dragging the nooses.  The government was upset that the whole &#8220;peaceful&#8221; demonstration could have turned into a wide scale riot.</p>
<p>You have to give the guy credit, he was pretty darn brave doing that considering he was, to put it mildly, outgunned.  The cops probably prevented another Reginald Denny situation.<br>

			<p>Whatever happened to the First Amendment, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION? Where is the ACLU? Just like you are free to stick a crucifix in urine, or burn an American flag, or smear dung on a picture of the Virgin Mary. You have a right to display a noose on YOUR OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY! In this case his OWN TRUCK. No one in the media seems to notice this blatant outrageous violation of this young man&rsquo;s civil rights. And the MEDIA of all people should understand what the First Amendment means. This is supposedly a FREE country. Not a totalitarian state. You have a right to EXPRESS yourself and OFFEND!<br>
Notice that the &ldquo;New Black Panther Party&rdquo; black racist goons who show up in communities across the country, from Durham during the black rape hoax there, to Jena, marching with a wide variety of openly displayed FIREARMS, are not arrested and charged with a hate crime. You tell me, which is more &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo;, someone with a noose hung on his own truck, or a throng of heavily armed goons? Which has the potential of  mass killing?<br>
Also notice that this young white man is getting a LONGER prison term for simply having a noose hanging from his own truck than that mob of 40 black racist teenagers got for the Halloween night vicious beating of three white girls in Newport Beach California, during which the black mob was screaming &#8220;F*** whites!&#8221; and &#8220;We hate whites!&#8221;, leaving one white girl unconscious who suffers permanent vision loss: The black teens in the Halloween attack were released with NO prison time! We could cite countless other cases of vicious PHYSICAL racially motivated hate crimes committed by blacks against people of light for which the black racist attackers received NO hate crime charges and nothing more than a slap on the wrist: From the black racist thugs who nearly beat Reginald Denny to death to the Jena black racist thugs who ambushed and attempted to beat to death a lone white kid.<br>
What a brazen double standard. And most white folks seem to be clueless what is going on.<br>

			<p>It is not true that Blacks will never change. In about 20,000 years, they will have evolved to about the place in humanoid evolution where the European and the east-asian are today. </p>
<p>And guess what? Their association with benevolent outsiders from the North will have sped up this process by about another 20,000 years. </p>
<p>This is assuming that George Bush does not come through on his insane plan to spend 30 billion US dollars combatting the one natural population control mechanism currently working in Africa, so that this wonderful continent can achieve its not-so-natural demographic potential and increase its hapless population of desperate souls to 2.5 billion by 2050 from 1.2 billion today (according to the UN). </p>
<p>AFRICA IS ARTIFICIALLY POPULOUS TODAY ONLY BECAUSE WESTERNERS BUILT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT FACILITATED POPULATION GROWTH.</p>
<p>The last thing Africa needs today is more Africans. Western do-gooders are oblivious to the impending disaster they are creating by promoting locally non-sustainable population increases Dark Continent.</p>

			<p>Time to FIGHT THE ENEMY with their own weapons. A lawsuit should be filed against the Jena 6 punks by their victim   &mdash;   seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars   &mdash;   for physical and mental suffering resulting from the gang attack. Another lawsuit against the courts FREEING these punks. A third suit for biased justice   &mdash;   punishing a kid for simply displaying a noose while six would-be killers were feted as &#8220;heroes.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The only thing this kid is guilty of, besides endangering himself and the other teenage passenger, is promoting the stereotype of the, &#8220;racist&#8221; noose. Far more Whites have been hung by these nooses, so this kid should get an education not a jail term. Ditto; Old Sage &amp; Schoolteacher</p>

			<p>They put the kid in a vise. He was indicted for civil Rights felonies that carried at least 10 years in the sodomy factory. His public defender knew that if he wanted to become a federal hero, he should talk the kid into copping a plea.<br>
     The government knew it couldn`t get anyone to convict an 18 year old kid of being a terorist so they now can make it all go away and still say that they aren`t racists republicans. The kid wasn`t going anywhere but Mc Donalds or the Army anyway.<br>
     The show at sentencing will be a hoot. The kid will come in with a coat and tie and about four black friends he just made at the anger managment and diversity seminars he attended. He will beg the forgiveness of the terrorized black folks raising hell in the streets. The federal judge will talk about sending a message to others who would dare intimidate black folks or worse make fun of them. He will sentence the kid to 6 months in jail and 6 months community service at a half way house where the kid will most likely get murdered. The Freedom of Speech has come a long way, baby. Another sacrificial lamb on the altar of cultural diversity is a small price to pay to keep a race war from exploding. I hope the kid undersatnds this as some 275 pound black thug unzips his trousers.<br>

			<p>If someone were to engage in a display of free expression while being White it would be a good idea to have some protection with you.  A gun suitable for the number of people likely to bother you should suffice.</p>
<p>Afterall, if you are going to be treated like the devil for expressing yourself, you should prepair to be treated like the devil.  </p>

			<p>Hey, here&rsquo;s a thought.</p>
<p>They send this message&hellip;the boy is sacrificed, killed in jail.  Of course, this will do NOTHING to appease blacks, it will merely wet their appetite.  </p>
<p>So the message gets sent out and no one says a word&hellip;.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem here.  As Nietzsche once said, &#8220;anyone who spends a lifetime fighting an enemy has a real keen interest on making sure their enemy - stays alive!&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, after all the Left, the SPLC, the ADL, the ACLU, they are not tearing down a Civilization to build a new one.<br>
They are NOT builders, they are destroyers. There&rsquo;s a book called &#8220;The Perfect Guide to the Latin American Idiot&#8221; that is about people in that part of the world making a living criticizing the USA.  They do little else, except of course steal from their own, routinely and with no conscience.  But now that the USA is being dismantled these clowns - and I know this from extensive personal experience with them - are in a panic.  They do not know what they are going to do.</p>
<p>Same with these people.  So, this is my prediction.  In the same way some children used to stick &#8220;Kick Me&#8221; signs on the backs of other children in school, the above mentioned groups are going to simply PUT nooses on cars and trucks and doorknobs, etc. in order to frame people, for what ever reason.  This is exactly what is meant by the thorougly ignoble slogan, &#8220;By Any Means Necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, we should use this as another reason to develop and foster alliances with each other.  Watch your backs folks.  I know I am.</p>

			<p>The usual story in cases like this unfortunate and unwise young man is that the defendant pleads guilty to a misdemeanor to avoid prosecution for one or more felonies he did not really commit.</p>
<p>The odds that he will be later photographed posing with a mouthfull of money are vanishingly small.</p>

			<p>Why isn&rsquo;t this all over the MSM?  Whites need to get angry in the same way the cry baby blacks did over the Jena scam.  This boy is being railroaded.  He may be guilty of disturbing the peace, and deserve some community service.  But he is not guilty of a hate crime, and he does not deserve Federal prison time.  Get angry whites!!  Your freedoms are being eroded!</p>

			<p>To amateur anthropolgist.</p>
<p>You make a lot of good sense.  Africa is over-populated - thanks to modern civilization that the African contributed nothing to bring about.  When non-blacks encountered the Africans, black tribes had not even invented the wheel yet.  They were backwards beyond belief.  They had no technology whatsoever and actually made the white man realize that humans are very much part of the animal kingdom.  But I won&rsquo;t say they are inferior to whites as that must be defined.  Whites are more analytically intelligent than africans and have larger brain sizes that seems to correlate with intelligence very well.    But black africans seem to have other talents such as gifted athletic ability.  Their black skin makes them less susceptible to skin cancers that I am prone to get.  The black africans have rithym.  They are different.  Neanderthals probably thought they too were more superior to homo sapiens who had migrated amongst them.  Neanderthals are extinct and we homo sapiens now rule the world.  So who was really superior?</p>
<p><br>
As far as the hangman&rsquo;s noose, I believe a hangman&rsquo;s noose is intimidating and in extremely poor taste.  It has no place near a march.  I&rsquo;m not interested in intimidating blacks, whites, or yellows.  I&rsquo;m interested in my civil right to live in peace and free from crime and intimidation.  Blacks have enslaved white people today and most of us can&rsquo;t see it.  For example, when I walk into a Walmart and have to listen to very loud black racist rap music in the parking lot from a passing car - that is a type of &#8220;hangman&rsquo;s noose&#8221; to me.  That black racist music is being played loud by the young black racist kid to intimidate whitey - just like the hangman&rsquo;s noose is there to intimidate blacky.   Yet there are no laws to stop the loud black racist rap music from being played to intimidate non-blacks and there needs to be laws in place.  If they want to listen to racist rap music then do it in their homes and not in public - I have civil rights too!!!!  Civil rights is not exclusively for black people - we all have rights!!  </p>

			<p>Who was his defense attorney? They did not do their job. We need more info on this case, all the information available. This needs to be taken to a higher non-bias court.</p>

<p>EXCELLENT POST Mal Evans.  Only slight correction I would make is that they probably already have set lots of people up.  I don&rsquo;t mean just hoaxes where they put a noose on their own door, etc. But on someone elses.  Hell, who knows, maybe someone even put this noose on this kids truck.  And, though I completely understand the need to release some of the energy that comes from the feelings of injustice that we experience, I do think it was not a wise choice to pull this stunt.</p>
<p>But, boy oh boy, if this young White man is convicted and sent to jail and harmed in any way we should flood the MSM (and for goodness sake, not just AR, where we&rsquo;re preaching to the choir) and Youtube, etc. to get the message out that we&rsquo;re not going to take it.</p>
<p>Everyone knows about the Priest the Power Elite sent off to jail. And not just any jail.  It was a death sentence.  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;Judicial Activism&#8221; and it&rsquo;s one of the many fronts from which the Left/Liberal/Neocon Power Elite fights its Dirty War.<br>
There are not going to start doing this to us, they ARE doing this to us.<br>

			<p><i>AFRICA IS ARTIFICIALLY POPULOUS TODAY ONLY BECAUSE WESTERNERS BUILT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT FACILITATED POPULATION GROWTH.</i></p>
<p>Actually, if you look at a population density map, you&rsquo;ll see that black Africa is not very densely populated at all. However, it soon will be, as the population is increasing at a very high rate due to western medicine and technology. </p>

<p>Doubtless he didn&rsquo;t have one.  He was threatened, and he pleaded out to a misdemeanor.</p>
