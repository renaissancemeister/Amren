						<p>New census data released Wednesday shows visible minorities in Canada have grown at a staggering rate, surpassing the five million mark.</p>
<p>The data, released by Statistics Canada, shows surging immigration from Asia has resulted in visible minorities now comprising 16 per cent of Canada&rsquo;s population &mdash; an increase of 27 per cent between 2001 and 2006.</p>
<p>Since 2001, three-quarters of Canada&rsquo;s new immigrants have been visible minorities, and the total now sits at 5,068,100, the census shows.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re seeing for the first time with this census that the South East Asians actually surpass Chinese as the largest minority group,&#8221; Statistics Canada&rsquo;s Rosemary Bender told CTV News on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Immigration lawyer Ravi Jain told CTV&rsquo;s Canada AM Wednesday morning he&rsquo;s not surprised that the number of South Asian immigrants &mdash; those hailing from Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan &mdash; is on the rise, with the highest number coming from India.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a real explanation here that makes sense,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;India of course is a former Commonwealth country. English is a dominant language and education is emphasized &mdash; the same thing as China in terms of education.&#8221;</p>
<p>South Asians now make up about one-quarter of the visible minority population in Canada, translating to about 4 per cent (nearly 1.3 million) of the country&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Those with Chinese roots make up about another quarter (some 1.2 million) of the total visible minority population.</p>
<p>Following those two ethnic groups are those identifying themselves as black, Filipino, Latin American, Arab, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean and Japanese, to make up the Top 10 visible minorities.</p>
<p>But Jain said most of Canada&rsquo;s new immigrants still end up clustered around Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal &mdash; a trend that he suggests can be addressed through better workplace integration.</p>
<p>According to the census, 96 per cent of the visible minority population live in a metropolitan area. That&rsquo;s in sharp contrast to the 68 per cent of the total population that live in major cities.</p>
<p>Jain said there should be more of a push to attract immigrants to places like Alberta, where there is a dramatic shortfall of workers and jobs are readily available.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will send the message that the provinces that do that &mdash; Alberta and others that aren&rsquo;t reflective of these major cities &mdash; they will draw in the immigrants and then we&rsquo;ll see more diversity besides Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>More than 200 different ethnic origins were reported in the 2006 census, StatsCan reports. That marks a steep increase over the past century. In the 1901 census, only 25 different ethnic groups were recorded. The largest share of the population at that time was people reporting Aboriginal, British and French origins.</p>
<p>Among the newer ethnic groups added to the list in 2006 were those from Montserrat in the Caribbean, and Chad, Gabon, Gambia and Zambia in Africa.</p>
<p>The study, dubbed Canada&rsquo;s Ethnocultural Mosaic, 2006 Census, shows Canada&rsquo;s visible minority population has been steadily growing over the past quarter-century:</p>
<p>    * 1981: 1.1 million visible minorities represented 4.7 per cent of the population;<br>
    * 1991: 2.5 million visible minorities accounted for 9.4 per cent of the total population;<br>
    * 1996: 3.2 million visible minorities represented 11.2 per cent;<br>
    * 2001: 3.98 million visible minorities comprised 13.4 per cent of the total population;<br>
    * 2006: 5,068,100 visible minorities account for 16 per cent of the total population.<br>

			<p>In other words, WHITE Canadians have diminished by a phenomenal 2.6% in only five years! Then what happens after the next five years, and the five years after that?? Wake-up Canada, you&rsquo;re quickly being replaced by 3rd world inhabitants who are colonizing your country.</p>

			<p>Disgusting! Whites the world over have succumbed to the &#8220;Camp Of The Saints&#8221; syndrome. Jean Raspail was a prophet&hellip;A race that will not even admit they are a RACE and deserve their own lands will die off and deserve to die off. Stupid White people.</p>

			<p>Ravi Jain lectures Canada on what they should do for his fellow foreigners.  I&rsquo;ve been to Canada a few times, and they seem to look down on us for our racial problems.  This serves them right.  <br>

			<p>The White Canadians also have a very low birthrate (the whole childfree movement was born there), I thought Britain would be the first Western nation to fall but it looks like that will be the beautiful (insanely liberal) Dominion of Canada.  </p>

			<p>Depressing news, but at least Somalis don&rsquo;t top the list re: the most numerous visible minority group. Chinese and South Asian immigrants don&rsquo;t thrill me, but they sure beat black Africans! And I&rsquo;ve noticed they hate black Africans even more than whites. If they ever came to dominate Canada&rsquo;s demographic makeup, they&rsquo;d probably boot all the blacks out.</p>

			<p>Many of my fellow white Canadians hate what is happening but are stark terrified to say anything about it for fear of job loss or persecution by one of the country&rsquo;s notorious &#8216;human rights commissions&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Yes, but is getting rid of the Caucasian population that forged Canada out of the wilderness, in order to make it a country worth coming to, an equitable solution as well?</p>
<p>I think not.</p>
<p>Until Whites realize that their countries are THEIR countries, and the dream of multiculturalism is the last dying gasp of the generation of the drug-befuddled [Boomer] hippies, yippies, et al, we are doomed.</p>

			<p>In the 1920&rsquo;s or 30&rsquo;s a black artist &#8216;Ellison&rsquo;? I think, wrote a book called &#8216;Invisible Man&rsquo;, which millions of school kids since have been required to read. The title given to the book was used to highlight the plight of the taken-for-granted black male.</p>
<p>In the 1970&rsquo;s George Gilder (who was apparently beaten up by blacks one too many times as a kid) wrote a book titled &#8216;Visible Man&rsquo;. Gilder was an adviser to Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>Since then there has been some talk that maybe it&rsquo;s white males who are &#8216;invisible&rsquo; in our society. In truth, from college administrators on down to the lowest AmRener: we all seem obsessed with people of color and blacks in particular.</p>
<p>Often times these things that appear in the media seem to be meant as a hidden joke&hellip; as if only the person behind it all gets the joke. It reminds me of a song by Depeche Mode, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t mean to start any blasphemous rumors, but I think that God has a sick sense of humor, when I die, I expect to find him laughing&#8221;.  . . Some say Europe and Canada, with their hate-think laws, are the furthest gone, but I think it&rsquo;s America that&rsquo;s the farthest gone. I wonder if this, &#8216;visible minorities&rsquo; thing is a play on &#8216;invisible man&rsquo;? I wonder if this is some kind of nod to white peoples obsession with people of color.  </p>

			<p>This is the tip of the iceberg of madness in Canada. Homosexual marriage, admission of AIDS sufferers as immigrants, the ceasing of the laws to apply to native Indians and their establishment of virtual semi-independent principalities, are a few of the other symptoms. The illusions that sustain Canada in this dangerous absurdity are only possible through a complacent prosperity. </p>
<p>Nothing will begin to change in Canada until there is enduring  hardship or tragedy which cannot be wished away or ignored. The myth of economic advantage through immigration combined with the moral self-congratulation it brings Canadians are too great, and the adherents of the ultra-liberal ideology here are too widespread and entrenched in the judical, governmental and educational systems. </p>
<p>The longer Canada goes without a trauma that could spark a wholesale rethink, the greater the risk of ultimate descent into savagery when such an event (e.g. a depression) does happen, with still cohesive ethnic groups abusing and plundering the atomized and hence defenceless white population at will. </p>
<p>I live in Canada, and the future scares me. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising to wake up and learn that you&rsquo;re almost  minority in a nation where once you were lucky to see a non-White face once a month.</p>
<p>The lasting legacy of Pierre Trudeau&rsquo;s Liberals and its Multiculturalism/open immigration policies has finally hit home enough that the very character of Canada is now news. And considering the lack of outrage or concern as Canada&rsquo;s Asian population sky-rocketed, it&rsquo;s really not realistic to think that there&rsquo;ll be a race war from Vancouver to Halifax between whites and blacks;</p>
<p>And we shouldn&rsquo;t be too smug about the mayhem in the USA over the trouble from illegal aliens crossing from Mexico and non-White crime. More and more our mainstream papers are focussing on black suspects wanted in shootings, rape, assault and robbery. Yes, those of us who mouth off about America&rsquo;s race troubles are living in a glass house, and Jean Raspail&rsquo;s Camp of the Saints was truly prophetic. If only we listened&hellip;</p>

			<p>Wow, look at what happened in just 1 generation - all because of a bunch of 60&rsquo;s dope-smoking, free lovin, draft dodging losers.</p>
<p>I have very little respect for the baby boomer generation because of stuff like this.</p>
<p>It was their job to pass on the inheritance of a nation from generation to generation and they royally screwed up.</p>

			<p>Canada is like Holland but without Geert Wilders; its suffocating atmosphere of political correctness has to be experienced directly to be credited. It glories in its post-modernity and identitilessness. A state, but not a nation; a &#8220;community of communities&#8221; as a former Prime Minister put it (without a trace of irony); the world&rsquo;s greatest hotel, as a briefly famous Canadian novelist put it;  &#8220;Canada is not a real country&#8221;, as the former Premier of Quebec put it. One shudders to think  what a colossal wreck it will one day make.  Canada&rsquo;s future will be as squalid and inglorious as it comes.   </p>

			<p>The world Pierre Truduea and the Liberals made. No one ever ASKED the Canadian people if they wanted the demographic makeup of their country so violently altered. The MSM in Canada talks about this like its a good thing. Canada is sleepwalking to its doom.</p>

			<p>I remember in high school in about 1985 I was told by the teacher of English literature that there was no such thing as a &#8220;Canadian&#8221;. I was being told I didn&rsquo;t exist. This is what at least three generations now have been raised to believe. Reading this article is like hearing the tolling of a bell for the historical entity called &#8220;Canada&#8221;, once a colony of Britain, later an independant country populated by the descendants of the pioneering English, French, Scottish and Irish people, who hacked a life and a country out of the endless forests. It&rsquo;s national identity was forged on the feilds of Europe during WW1 in crucibles like Vimy Ridge. It endured great depressions and exemplified itself in its conduct during a second Global war. It flourished and grew until it was beset by a terrible sickness in the 1960&rsquo;s when its new generation of leaders, a hostile elite, began the first steps in it&rsquo;s destruction. The nation that was once the country of Canada is now in the terminal stages of its desease. Canada is dying. What is rising from its ashes is not anything I would identify as the historical entity known as &#8220;Canada&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Canada is the biggest shiniest diaper on the planet, and every rotten Third World nation knows it.  The statistics are actually worse than they might appear to people who arent familiar with Canada: youve got to add 4% for American Indians and Métis, who have their own census categories, and aren&rsquo;t added into a list of &#8220;visible minorities&#8221;.  (Though to be honest, a lot of them really do look white.)  So basically 20%, not 16%, of Canada is nonwhite, and of course it is only going to up. I remember reading on this site an article from the 90s which predicted that Canada would soon surpass the USA in nonwhite population per capita.  And it may very well come true.  When your nation&rsquo;s immigration policy is &#8220;Give us your criminals, your terrorists, your perverts, and your generally unwanted population.   Canada is your dumpster!&#8221;, what else can we expect?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m American, by the way, though I live close to the border and have friends in Canada.  Personally I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m in America.  </p>

			<p>The explanation for immigration from the Indian sub-continent can also be found in the fact that India is the largest contributor to world population growth. The population of that sub-continent is greater than all the developed countries combined (all Europe, Australia, NZ, Japan, Canada and the US). The unwelcome hordes of Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, etc have half filled many British towns and cities bringing fraud, corruption and a drain on all resources. Bangladesh with a population of 148million and Pakistan with 166 million seem unable to develop and offer a future to their natives, this despite huge amounts of aid and building programmes carried out by the US, UK and others. Their helplessness was particularly seen in the wake of the earthquakes, when like those in New Orleans they seemed to wait for aid from the developed (white) world. These prople lead the mass immigration into all our European countries, Canada is but an example of colonisation by these peoples.</p>

			<p>This is an important term in Canada, as their laws require giving preferential hire to &#8220;visible minorities&#8221;. Apparently they dispense with even the ridiculous minimal formality  we have of requiring them to be &#8220;historically disadvantaged/underrepresented&#8221; and simply just give preference to minorities, which means even high-scoring Asians are given preferential hire.</p>
