						<p>A Hispanic woman who won the Miss California USA contest only to have her crown yanked days later sued the pageant Thursday for half a million dollars, alleging rigging and racial bias.</p>
<p>The pageant director rejected the claims, saying winners during his tenure have been some of the pageant&rsquo;s most racially diverse ever.</p>
<p>Christina Silva, 24, was crowned Miss California USA on Nov. 25. Three days later, the pageant&rsquo;s executive director, Keith Lewis, told her &#8220;there has been a mistake and you are not the winner,&#8221; according to the lawsuit filed in Superior Court.</p>
<p>Raquel Beezley, 21, was subsequently crowned.</p>
<p>Silva is of Ecuadorean and Mexican descent. The lawsuit claims Lewis was &#8220;uncomfortable with the fact that Miss Silva spoke Spanish with certain vendors; he felt that it may detract from the caliber of the pageant and some of the &#8216;all American girls&rsquo; may not opt to compete in the following year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silva alleges that Lewis, the pageant, its producer K2 Productions and the Miss Universe Organization engaged in fraud, negligence, breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among other charges.</p>

			<p>If anything the pageant should be sued for discrimination against whites. This Silva woman is not bad looking but you could walk down any street in Santa Monica and find a white woman who would blow any of the other contestants out of the water in terms of beauty.</p>

			<p>Other than the obvious diversity malarkey, you&rsquo;d think that directors of any organization would place more attention on making sure they make the final decisions concrete and 100% correct so as not to set oneself up for questioning. </p>
<p>Silva&rsquo;s allegation is ridiculous, but Lewis asked for it.</p>
<p>Is the girl legal? They probably didn&rsquo;t check into it. </p>
<p>I digress. It&rsquo;s all too common that people in high ranking positions(not that director of a pagent is a too high ranking position) do not fulfill their responsibilities(do their job). People in big positions make big mistakes that are unforgiveable. It&rsquo;s who you know, not what you know. </p>

			<p>I am in agreement with much of what people say on this site. But the comment of &#8220;Civilized Neighbor&#8221; is very subjective. In my view the best looking Latina women easily hold their own against White women in the looks department. For example I&rsquo;ve seen Puerto Rican girls in NYC that will floor any man with eyeballs and a pulse. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand, I&rsquo;d never have kids with one and I&rsquo;m not knocking white women at all. </p>

			<p>If most of the 12-20 million Latino illegal aliens looked as good and were as White/European as this beauty - Christina Silva, 24, I would support amnesty tomorrow. Wow! What a beauty. I must say that the whiter Latin/Spanish women are some of the best looking women in the world and few have bad politics or watch corrupt anti White &#8220;American&#8221; (yeah right) TV or movies.</p>

			<p>In the multicultural paradise that is now the United States of America, there is forever going to be, in every situation involving a choice, charges of racial bias, racism, favoritism, etc., from every &#8220;minority group&#8221;, that feels aggrieved by the dominant culture. It permeates this society now as ubiquitously as the air we breath and will not end in the forseeable future.</p>

<p>If she was speaking Spanish to certain vendors than she was making it clear that she was not a true US citizen.  In that sense, she wouldn&rsquo;t be a good representer of an English speaking country. <br>

<p>PUHLEEZE, stop calling them Spanish! The Spanish people don&rsquo;t look like this, they are Europeans. What will it take to convince Whites that Spaniards DO NOT look like what&rsquo;s invading the country? Spaniards look like us! </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mean to rant, but I see this all the time and it drives me crazy. Must be all those Spanish tourist posters of flamenco dancers who are Gypsies.       </p>

			<p>Samuel, Thank you for correcting me.. but as I saw it, neither her hair texture skin color nor physiogonomy pointed to a purely black woman. Apparently the average American black is 30% white, this woman stikes as closer to an even mix. But then theirs surgery skin lightner&hellip;who knows? .. still I wish her well.</p>

			<p>Samuel, if both of the new Miss America&rsquo;s parents have strong white ancestry, which is likely judging from her appearance, then she is Mulatto. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, I believe white women deserve exclusive franchise in the Miss America Pageant, as it was originally. Whites represent my vision of America, others can always display themselves in other pageants  &mdash;  even other national pageants.</p>

			<p>I think that most Latinas are way better looking than most Whites, but that&rsquo;s just my 2 cents. They are also a lot smarter than you might think they are. The Hispanic is a formidable opponent, and yes, in Hispanic areas of California, you see Hispanics of all classes who look quite White. They look about the same as a lot of Med Whites. It&rsquo;s true that the more middle class ones with some money tend to be lighter and the very poorest and gangbangers tend to be darker, but that&rsquo;s just a generalization. These people are just a genetic grab bag really.</p>

			<p>Why not sue a beauty contest on the basis that they simply thought you were ugly? After all, ugliness is discriminatory (like race) and according to the Marxists beauty is just a construct, a product of culture and social conditioning (like race). Heck, why shouldnt the elephant man win the damn contest..it&rsquo;s just a different standard of beauty, that&rsquo;s all!</p>
<p>Multi-racialism puts judges of beauty contests in am impossible bind. If they are white, they will naturally find white women more attractive, and will vote for them. So how are they supposed to judge if not from their own personal preferences? Are they also supposed to try and imagine what an oriental man would find attractive in a chinese woman? I suppose the only answer is to have racially-mixed panels..but then of course most people will simply vote for their &#8216;own&rsquo; woman out of loyalty..thus creating another source of friction, which will inevitably be blamed on whitey-why didn&rsquo;t you do something/why didn&rsquo;t you stop doing that/why didn&rsquo;t you do this (delete as applicable to demonstrate white culpability)<br>

<p>LOL!  Your tastes are quite different than about 99.9% of other white males, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>I lived and worked in Calif., Ariz., Nevada, Colorado, Texas, and if I were to give an unbiased general description of the average Latina it would be:  About 5&rsquo;2&#8221;, 170 pounds, with  manish-looking features, and a personality that incorporates a lot of complaining.<br>

			<p>Only a brain-dead bureaucrat could have invented the word &#8220;Latino.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at all the countries in Latin America. They don&rsquo;t even all speak Spanish. Portuguese-speaking Brazilians range from coal-black, especially in the improverished backward north, to Germans and Italians from the south.</p>
<p>Having grown up with Cubans in Florida, I can generalize that the lighter they are, the better they are. All your better class of Cubans are proud of their heritage in Old Spain   &mdash;   and they&rsquo;ll let you know it.</p>
<p>So: White Latinos Si, black-Indian Latinos No.    </p>
<p>As for Miss Silva, she looks white enough to me that I&rsquo;d say she&rsquo;s welcome in the USA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d no sooner exclude white Brazilians, Cubans,  or Argentines from our country than I would Spaniards, Italians, Greeks, or any other caucasian of Mediterranean type. Nordic-Slavic-Mediterrean, the white race must stand together against barbarism. </p>
<p>As for the rest, you couldn&rsquo;t build a fence high enough.</p>

			<p>wr: Don&rsquo;t think so. Latinas are regarded as hot by most folks around here. That means Whites, Blacks and Hispanics. I&rsquo;m not talking about the fat ones. I&rsquo;m talking about the good looking ones. It&rsquo;s a case of a nice mixture of races producing a new race that is better looking than either of the components. On the net also, Latinas are considered hot. And if you go to Florida, it&rsquo;s always a dark-skinned Latina winning the beauty contests. I don&rsquo;t think a White blond even stands a chance. Everyone wants the Latina.</p>
<p>They are more submissive and feminine than White women, too, just my 2 pfennig. They will make you feel like a real man too, worship you like a God. They blow hot and cold, but so do Italians.</p>
<p>You would be surprised how many White guys here go for Latinas. There are White Supremacist gangs in my town called Peckerwoods but the joke is not only do they let Blacks and Mexicans join, but lots of them have Latina girlfriends. Welcome to California.</p>

Just a european view and shes really not that great looking man ive seen girls ten times nicer than that just walking around california.</p>

			<p>A mulatto did just win Miss USA. Her predecessor is also a mulatto. These pagaents are becoming a joke. Since they started giving the title to &#8216;the black one&rsquo; now all of the states are sending &#8216;black ones&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Miss America has kind of turned around started crowning whites again. Probably because the PC got so out of hand it nearly destroyed the franchise. </p>

<p>It is?  I live in Florida, and if you think a good looking blond isn&rsquo;t appreciated or could win a beauty contest I have a bridge called the Sunshine Skyway I&rsquo;d like to sell you.</p>
<p>While there are definitely SOME good-looking Hispanic women, to say they&rsquo;re the cream of the crop is just plain silly, or that they&rsquo;re numerous.  And to say they&rsquo;re submissive makes me wonder if you know what you&rsquo;re talking about at all.  Most are argumentative and complain a lot, and they don&rsquo;t come across as very bright to me. (I&rsquo;m referring to non-Cubans who are mostly mestizo.) I lived and worked in several areas in the West with large Hispanic populations and I have to say that, to read what you are writing, plus your prior posts, you come across as some kind of self-hating white that wants to denigrate his people all he can, perhaps because you haven&rsquo;t been successful with white women and resent them for it, I don&rsquo;t know.  But there&rsquo;s some kind of underlying animosity that taints your views, over and above the usual left wing brainwashing that grips a lot of people like you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re so much pro-black and pro-non-white, why would you want to live in this country?  The people of color you prefer are just over the border.  I suspect you could get a few bucks together and start a business down there, if you couldn&rsquo;t get a job.  Wouldn&rsquo;t you be happier?</p>

			<p>Robert Lindsay is just baiting you folks here. I live and work in L.A. and most whites do not go for &#8216;latinas&rsquo;, just as most latinas do not go for whites.. The ones here and there who are attractive are mostly white in their genetic background. However, most are unattractive and primitive looking. That&rsquo;s a fact. If there&rsquo;s bias, it&rsquo;s the other way, as non-whites are handed almost every top prize in every contest imaginable in this state, most of the time of course not deserving any type of prize or reward at all. </p>

			<p>Latino and Hispanic are really misnomers.  They only assumed that name because of the carry over from the &#8220;Latin Church&#8221; that then became the geographic term Latin America.  Latins are northern Italians and Latin is a root European language.</p>
<p>Today, it is easy to find indigenous Mexicans - Mestizos at best - attempting to claim that they are closely related not just to Spaniards but the French, just because the languages are Latin based.  That is what comes of little or no education and racial politics.</p>

<p>Peckerwoods or &#8216;woods is what Whites are called in the California Prison/Jail system. I doubt these are &#8220;White Supremacists&#8221;. They are a bunch of kids with a swastika tatoo and a Meth habit. Not White in my book. Welcome to California. Your going to say good-bye to California one day like a lot of Whites are doing or you will be finding yourself the victim of a hate crime. And I only say this because I like you Robert.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m 50 and never married, but I have dated 200 women or so in that lifetime. Most of them were White, I assure you. I don&rsquo;t know if that counts for success or failure, but that&rsquo;s a short sexual history for your prying eyes.</p>
<p>My attitude about White women right now is they are greedy and money grubbing. They practically won&rsquo;t go out with you unless they can see your bank account or your net worth, but maybe I just say that because I&rsquo;m broke. </p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&rsquo;t been successful&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t exactly cut it. Resent em? Yeah, I don&rsquo;t like money grubbing females of any ethnicity.</p>

			<p>I live in a state with a population of over 40 million people (not counting the many illegals) and whites are definitely a minority here now. Yet the majority race, Latino, continues to enjoy all the free welfare perks of minorities while we get taxed and kicked to the side. I think miss entitled USA should go back to Mexico and run for Miss Mexico.  </p>
