						<p>L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa warned that work-site raids on &#8220;nonexploitative&#8221; businesses could have a severe impact on the local economy.</p>
<p>Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is asking federal officials to rethink their policy on workplace immigration crackdowns that involve established businesses and to focus on employers that mistreat workers instead.</p>
<p>The mayor said in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff that work-site raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement could have &#8220;severe and long-lasting effects&#8221; on the local economy, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Villaraigosa accused federal officials of targeting &#8220;established, responsible employers&#8221; in industries that rely on &#8220;workforces that include undocumented immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In these industries, including most areas of manufacturing, even the most scrupulous and responsible employers have no choice but to rely on workers whose documentation, while facially valid, may raise questions about their lawful presence,&#8221; he wrote in the March 27 letter.</p>
<p>He said ICE should spend its limited resources targeting employers who exploit wage and hour laws.</p>
<p>Chertoff has not responded to the mayor&rsquo;s letter, but Homeland Security spokeswoman Laura Keehner said the department believes its priorities are correct.</p>

			<p>This is an example of why we need to make the e-verify program mandatory for all workers with no exceptions.  A pro-Latino racist like Mayor Villarigosa should not be allowed to dictate how our nation&rsquo;s immigration laws will be enforced.  We do not allow white people to decide whether or not we enforce the tax laws even though they pay most of it.  We don&rsquo;t let blacks decide if murder laws are enforced even though they are 33 times more likely to commit murder than an Asian.  The same is true with Hispanics even thought they commit the majority of  immigration offences.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned Villarigosa is just a bigot of color.  Perhaps there is a way we could sue him on the grounds of discrimination on the basis of national origin.  My origin is American.</p>

			<p>  The Mayor of Los Angeles is supporting illegal aliens taking jobs from Americansaccording to this article. <br>
  Why can some citizens  who live there not sue the Mayor for violating their civil rights to the jobs held by illegal aliens who used false papers ?  <br>
  Why does the Mayor aid forgers and fraud in taking jobs from American citizens ? Can the Federal government not arrest him for his public stance of defending illegal /criminal acts of FRAUD even without the illegal aliens being arrested first ?<br>

			<p>With the unemployment rate nearing 5 percent, there&rsquo;s no need for illegal workers. The businesses are probably kicking back to the mayor in return for his support. Jail some business owners and you&rsquo;ll see how quickly they&rsquo;ll change their tune.</p>

			<p>Notice how they never offer any proof?</p>
<p>Increasingly, real statistics are being kept about this and other economic issues related to immigration.  Overwhelmingly, they say the same thing, no matter what country it is.  Non-white immigration is an INCREDIBLE drain on every economy.  In a very real and direct manner, economic prosperity for a community, ANY community in the world, no matter what the country, but most dramatically in the USA, depends on getting rid of non-white immigrants, especially those on welfare and/or of a criminal bent.</p>
<p>Want the US economy to boom?  Shut down the border and start mass deportations.  That&rsquo;s the bottom line.</p>

			<p>Why should this Mexican mayor want to obey any immigration law, his culture disproportionately benefits from its law-breaking in America and he is showing his bigoted nepotism ; plus here is a man who disrepects the law of God, fidelity in marriage; so breaking a secular law is even easier for this traitor.</p>

As for the comment: Villaraigosa accused federal officials of targeting &ldquo;established, responsible employers&rdquo; in industries that rely on &ldquo;workforces that include undocumented immigrants.&rdquo;<br>
The last two words, undocumented immigrants&#8221; is the clue to the simple minded mayor as to whom ICE should target, regardless of how well established the employers.  What doesn&rsquo;t the mayor not understand about the fact that it is the duty of ICE to apprehend and deport illegal aliens(notice his use of the far more benign &#8220;undocumented immigrants&#8221;).</p>

This may as well read Villaraigosa accused federal officials OF DOING THEIR JOBS.</p>
<p>This is a guy who failed the bar four times, and left his wife and kids for a newscaster who has since dumped him.  Anyone ever hear him speak?  He couldn&rsquo;t pass Public Speaking 101 in English or Spanish.  A thorough discrace.    He&rsquo;s and empty suit, a smile and a handshake. Totally devoid of ethics, morals or a decent education. However he&rsquo;s quite the hero in the Spanish press and LA Times.</p>

			<p>Why are these traitors allowed to break the law with impunity?  Any person who champions the rights of illegals is defacto breaking the law, and must be punished.  When the government decides to enforce the existing laws, I feel that banishment would be a fitting penalty - let the enabler criminals live among the third worlders who they claim they can&rsquo;t live without.</p>

At their swearing-in ceremonies, don&rsquo;t mayors have to pledge something about upholding the laws of the land? If this Brown Supremacist isn&rsquo;t willing to do that, then let&rsquo;s begin proceedings to remove him from office. </p>
<p>This flagrant disregard for the white man&rsquo;s laws and culture is simply more proof that Villa-Reconquista regards the non-latino citizens of LA as nothing more than a useful nuisance. Other than the all-important TAX $$$ that LA&rsquo;s whites and Asians generate   &mdash;   without which Antonio and his beloved mestizo millions would all drop dead before dinnertime   &mdash;   Americans and American institutions (ICE, LAPD, etc) are regarded as mere obstacles on the road to Mexicanizing the entire SoCal region. <br>

			<p>If some businesses can&rsquo;t (WON&rsquo;T) pay a fair wage and HIRE AMERICAN WORKERS, those businesses DO NOT DESERVE TO SURVIVE! Any questions?</p>
<p><br>
As a patriotic and THINKING American, I am tired of hearing these weak lies and claims meant to justify the presence of 35 million illegal immigrants. DRIVE THEM OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.  We Americans want, DEMAND our country to be as it was 30-40 years ago. Clean, White, relatively crime-free compared to today!</p>

			<p>This is standard fair for ex-gangbanger Tony Villar, A.K.A. Antonio Villaraigossa. He is quite simply a Mexican Nationalist, who has been given power by the elite that run California,and Los Angeles(no, I don&rsquo;t believe the citizens do)in order to have someone represent the massive wage depressing, employer enriching illegal alien population for them. No mystery to his dramatic rise to power at all. No rational person would believe such an ignorant person as Villaraigossa(failed law exam 4 times)could reach becoming Mayor of the second largest city in the U.S. by his own intelligence. He had much help, from the well connected and influential  &mdash;  or as one poster wrote, &#8220;Those in power use the values of the powerless, as a means of controling them&#8221;  &mdash;   Friedrich Nietzche.</p>

			<p>It gets worse. The Los Angeles police department has a policy against inquiring into the immigration status of gangsters. Dennis Zine introduced a bill that would require police officers to inquire into the status of gangster but the mexicans on the city council are opposed to the policy. Mr Zine introduced the bill after African american citizen was killed by an illegal mexican. LA city&rsquo;s policy appears to favor the freedom of illegal criminals over the safety of American citizens.</p>
<p>In the California State Assembly Democrats are introducing crazy legislation to increase taxes on beer, plastic bags and practically everything that leftists deem a sin to close a budget deficit caused by the economic burden imposed by Latino immigrants.</p>

<p>I have made this point here in AR, (before I changed my screen name), and I suppose it&rsquo;s time to make it again.  If it were white towns in Mississippi that passed laws prohibiting its local cops from giving information to the FBI when they investigate cases of Federal civil rights abuses by whites against blacks, the left wouldn&rsquo;t need a Tom Tancredo to cut off money.  The FBI would have already rode cowboy into the town and arrested the white politicians who gave &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; to civil rights abusers, and the U.S. JustUs Department would draw up charges of obstruction/conspiracy, etc etc.  Why the FBI isn&rsquo;t riding into L.A. to arrest the Mayor is a mystery, but I have a good idea why not.</p>
