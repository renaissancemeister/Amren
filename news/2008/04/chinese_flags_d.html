						<p>China&rsquo;s red flag was seemingly everywhere on the Australian leg of the Olympic torch relay, a nationalistic display that swamped protesters&rsquo; efforts to draw attention to human rights issues in Tibet and elsewhere. </p>
<p>Critics said the demonstration of Chinese pride was orchestrated by officials linked with Beijing, which has been profoundly embarrassed by protests during what was supposed to be a parade of global harmony ending at the Olympics. </p>
<p>China denied any involvement in sponsoring supporters. </p>
<p>Australian officials celebrated the relative peace of Thursday&rsquo;s 10- mile run through the capital as a triumph &mdash; at least compared to other places where the torch was almost seized by protesters or security measures were so strict that the event appeared more military than celebratory. </p>
<p>The Australia leg began as a half-dozen police in jogging pants, T- shirts and baseball caps formed a cordon around the torchbearer while other police manned crowd-control barriers. </p>
<p>An airplane skywriter spelled out &ldquo;Free Tibet&rdquo; overhead and police hauled away one man who sat down for a split second in the path of a torch runner. </p>
<p>In one of several tense scenes away from the relay, a group of pro- Chinese tried to use their flags to cover &ldquo;Free Tibet&rdquo; signs carried by protesters. The two groups yelled at each other until police intervened. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thousands of Chinese supporters traveled from Sydney and Melbourne for the relay. City officials estimated there were about 10,000 pro- Chinese, outnumbering protesters 4-1. </p>
<p>Pro-Tibet protester Thanh Tan Huynh alleged Chinese government officials had paid expenses for ethnic Chinese to travel to Canberra. </p>
<p>Stanhope said it was evident that &ldquo;some central organization&rdquo; was behind all the China supporters and that he believed the Chinese ambassador had been in contact with Chinese community groups. </p>
<p>A Chinese Embassy official who refused to give his name told The Associated Press the government had not been involved in sponsoring any relay supporters. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu sidestepped a question on the issue, instead questioning whether &ldquo;disruptive elements&rdquo; were asked if they received outside help. </p>
<p>Chinese newspapers reported that 3,000 Chinese flags collected through an Internet donation drive had been shipped to Canberra. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s irrelevant whether the Chinese government sponsored them or not. The fact that these Chinese were willing to travel to Canberra to take part in the protest is proof of their feelings for their &#8220;motherland&#8221; and evidence that they are indeed a fifth column in Australia. I have no doubt that among the protesters were many Australian permanent residents, citizens and students studying here in order to get residency in the future. </p>

			<p>I have hearn that in Vancouver, BC there are Chinese restaurants where they will not serve a non-Chinese.</p>
<p>All that PC work on whites only to have a large group like the Chinese negate it.  But it is every affected nation&rsquo;s fault for allowing in overwhelming numbers in the first place.</p>

			<p>The Han Chinese are perhaps the most ethnocentric people in the world. Note how their support for China - which illegally absorbed and abuses Tibet - is based not on any concept of fair play but is just a tribal refex. </p>

			<p>What is interesting is the total lack of guilt in the Chinese about the murder of a million people in Tibet. This is the same with the Turks. Most Turks I have come across have not guilt about their brutal empire, especially their treatment of the Armenians. They will never allow the mass immigration of Arabs, Greeks and Bulgarians to their own nation. Compare that to Europeans (especially Northern Europeans) who are filled with guilt for just being born whites. People like the Swedes whose ancestors hardly had much of an empire and who send a lot of aid to Africa, are encouraged to have a guilty consciousness. </p>
<p>    I wonder why? Maybe because the Chinese and the Turks have never been brainwashed with Christianity in their past?</p>

			<p>Now that we have a new (Chinese speaking) Prime Minister in Australia, we&rsquo;re set to become even more enmeshed into Asia.  Large parts of Sydney these days barely resemble a Western civilised city.  </p>
<p>Apart from noticeable recent influxes of Indians (many looking like surly individuals) and black Africans (causing increasing mayhem on the streets of our capital cities, and even some regional cities), the vast majority of faces seen almost everywhere one looks is Chinese.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that outside help would not be necessary to provide a show of support for the Beijing Olympics, as there seems to be &#8216;teeming millions&rsquo; of Chinese everywhere I look in Sydney.  </p>

<p>It appears to be that chinese people, whereever they are, demonstrate they pride and don&rsquo;t show the slightest sign of remorse for the human rights violations of China.</p>
<p>What a difference with white people!!!</p>

&gt; This is exactly what I have argued for years on Amren.  Even European socialism is a product of the self-deminishing influence of Christianity.  Compare it to Chinese Communism, where patriotism and racial pride is encouraged.  (Luckly, Russia is split in this as the Orthodox church made native soil a big part of the religious identity.  In Serbia, King Lazar, who was killed by the invading Turks in Kosovo is revered as a Serbian Christ.) <br>

<p>Christianity is blamed for the failure of western european civilization. It is not Christianity but western european intepretation of Christianity that is the problem. It was western european protestants who made the examination of conscience a fetish. Christianity has died in western europe and been replaced with the examination of conscience for leftist sins such as racism, neglect of the environment and smoking.<br>

			<p>All nationalities demonstrate pride in their heritage, whether it be the Irish, Italians, CHinese, Mexicans, blacks, or even Germans.<br>
When Italy won the World Cup in 2006, Australian Italians, many second or third generation, came out in force brandishing Italian flags and generally just whooping it up. And Serbian-Australians and Croatian-Australian spectators have clashed in the past at Australian Tennis opens. Why would one not expect the same from Chinese Australians?</p>
<p><i>Note how their support for China - which illegally absorbed and abuses Tibet - is based not on any concept of fair play but is just a tribal refex.</i></p>
<p>Utter rubbish. China&rsquo;s claim over Tibet goes way back before the first European stepped foot in the Americas. China&rsquo;s claim over Tibet is of course not entirely unchallengeable but it is at least one hundred times more legitimate, in a moral sense, than the white presence in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Furthermore since China resumed sovereignty in 1950, Tibetan life expectancy has almost doubled from 35 to 67 today (note that Australian aboriginal life expectancy is only 59). The population has doubled from 2.5million to over 5 million. Tibetans, as do other ethnic minorities benefit from a raft of affirmative action policies, including easier access to tertiary education, and most of all they are not restricted by the one-child policy.<br>
Tibetans also have the choice of education entirely in Tibetan or entirely in Mandaring. Bilingualism is enforced in all the autonomous regions of China. Tibetans are still 80 to 90percent of the population of Tibet. Aborigines and Native Americans comprise only about 2 to 3% of the populations of their respective places.</p>
<p>Whites should perhaps just stop passing judgement on China&rsquo;s actions in Tibet - which are much more humane than the way whites have treated their own indigenous populations. </p>
<p>But of course whites will not do this, because they fear the rise of a high-IQ non-white power. The first great non-white power in living memory. But that is just tough. Learn to live with it.</p>

<p> You quite unwittingly prove everything I said about the ethnocentric nature of the Han Chinese. If the Chinese rule over Tibet (&#8220;re-assumed in 1950&#8221;, I like that euphenism, as if it was as natural an event as a spring rainfall) was so wonderful why are the Tibetans rising up in revolt? Do you live in the west by the way? If China is such a paradise why is this? And while you condemn White expansion you enjoy its benefits by residing in the west. Do the words hypocrite mean anything to you? (Assuming you are residing in a western country).</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Luckly, Russia is split in this as the Orthodox church made native soil a big part of the religious identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true I know several ex-protestants who have gone over to the Orthodox churches since they feel that many of their own churches have been completely PC-fied. By Orthodox I mean Russian, Ukrainian etc&hellip; as the Syrian or Ethiopian are too alien for whites to go to. One of the Presbyterian Church I went to was obsessed about helping Africa. Same with some devout Catholics I have come across. Once they were promoting adopting poor African kids and they had brochures with photos. The only good point about these White Christians was that they were generally of good stock, had a lot of kids and maintained traditional values to a greater extent.  Anyways a religion which can be shared with other races especially blacks is not really a good idea. Whites need something like Hinduism or Shinto, something race specific in nature.<br>

			<p>Mr Liu,     </p>
<p>  However humane the Tibetans might have been treated, nearly a million of them have been killed. That is a genocide right there.  You cannot complain about the actions of the Imperial Japanese Empire while justifying the actions of the Chinese Communist in Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Manchuria and Eastern Turkmenistan. You cannot have it both ways. The Tibetans never invited you. As far as Native Americans and Aboriginals are concerned, the majority of them died due to disease. I agree some brutality was committed against them on the part of Europeans, something which most Whites accept and feel guilty about anyways. Most Chinese I know justify their genocide and feel no guilt whatsoever.</p>
<p>    The difference between the achievements of Aboriginal Australians and Tibetans can be explained by the fact that the Chinese came across a high IQ north East Asian population similar to the Chinese in Tibet while the Whites came across a very primitive low IQ (probably lower than African blacks) population in Australia.  </p>
<p>   We have nothing to fear of a high IQ non White nation. We are more concerned about the state of affairs in our own nations. It is not easy to keep a high IQ population down for long just as it is nearly impossible to uplift a low IQ population (African and Australian blacks). The Japanese empire came out as a serious military challenge to the White powers much before China but the White powers did not stop it from remerging economically after WW2. China is not the first great non White power in the modern era, the Japanese beat you to it.<br>

			<p>Jasper; That one million figure is so laughable that even many Tibetan activists don&rsquo;t use it anymore. After all there were only about  2.5 milIion Tibetans in 1950. It is a crazy figure bandied about to discredit China&rsquo;s role in Tibet. </p>
<p>Those that did die were part of the cataclysms of the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution - events that affected everyone in China. Destruction of Tibetan monasteries (often carried out by Tibetan red guards) was matched by the smashing of Han Chinese cultural artifacts and cultural traditions.</p>
<p>Ninety five percent of Tibetans were slaves to a feudal theocracy in 1950. The 1959 uprising was carried out by Tibetan aristocrats and Lamas angry that their lands were being redistributed to the theretofore landless peasantry. Most Tibetans see themselves to be a part of China. It is ridiculous to hold the views of Tibetan <i>exiles</i> to be representative of all Tibetans - just as it would be ridiculous to assume the views of Miami Cubans on Castro represent the views of all Cubans.</p>
<p>As for genocide, even the Dalai Lama only uses the term &#8216;cultural genocide&rsquo; - which is ridiculous to anyone who has ever visited Tibet. In Tibet, Tibetan culture is everywhere, the Tibetan language is heard, Tibetan TV stations and radio stations abound and many Tibetans still follow traditional pastoral and nomadic lifestyles. Constrast this to American or Australia; one could visit both these places and hardly ever sight an indigenous person, let alone see TV in an indigenous language, hear radio in an indigenous language. And those few indigenous who remain are often of a very genetically altered form.</p>
<p>As for what you call &#8216;East Turkmenistan&rsquo; the fact is this area has been part of China for far longer than Texas, New Mexico or California has been part of the US. </p>
<p>Manchuria and Inner Mongolia are also part of China - these people invaded China and assimilated themselves into China - hardly something you can blame the Han Chinese for. Everyone has heard of Genghis Khan, and some will know that the last ruling dynasty of China, the Qing, ruled for some 400 years. Manchurians almost all consider themselves Han now and have been totally assimilated. Just like how the Normans conquerors were assimilated into Britain.</p>
<p>And very few Inner Mongolians have a problem with being part of CHina - intermarriage between Han and Mongolians are extensive - after all these two groups are about as different as Swedes and Finns.</p>
<p>So yes, Chinese do feel bad about what happened to Tibetan culture during the Cultural Revolution, including the current crop of leaders - many of whom also suffered in the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>But overall China&rsquo;s record in Tibet is a noble one; Tibetans are far better off than they were in 1950 in almost any single respect you could care to think of. </p>
<p>And unlike the indigenous that came up against European rule, Tibetans still form 80 to 90percent of the population of Tibet.  <br>
And strangely enough under the &#8216;genocidal&rsquo; CHinese, the population has doubled along with life expectancy. Surely if the Chinese were keen on wiping out Tibetans they would have done it (600million Chinese against 2million Tibetans) in the thirty years China was completely shut off from the outside world?</p>
<p>And by the way, the US recognized Tibet as part of China, as it does today, in 1942 - eight years <i>before</i> the so-called 1950 &#8216;invasion.&rsquo; </p>

			<p><i>China is not the first great non White power in the modern era, the Japanese beat you to it.</i><br>
Japan, like Germany was set up by the US as bulwarks against international communism. Japan does not have an independent foreign policy and is just the lickspittle of the US - hardly a great &#8216;non-white&rsquo; power.<br>
China won its independence in 1949, and has maintained that independence against two of the greastest superpowers the world has  ever seen - the US and Soviet Union. And over the past thirty years  the rapidity and scope of her rise has been unprecedented in all of human history.</p>
<p>China does not threaten the West. But based on her past history China has every reason to fear the West. And the behaviour of whites towards the Tibetan issue shows that whites still have not given up on their designs to carve up China.</p>

			<p>The attitude of Chinese Australians reminds me of when I was living Down Under, and an Iranian soccer team came to play in Sydney.  Iranian Australians were happy to see them, and the young women, wearing bikinis and flip-flops were out waving Iranian flags.  I suppose that soccer team never forgot the experience.</p>
<p>Two of my closest friends in Australia were ethnic Chinese.  One was the guy I worked with, and the other was a fellow who could best be described as a &#8220;nazi&#8221; my co-worker introduced me to.  They were a funny pair.  My co-worker had been born in Malaysia, and hids family had left becase since Chinese are smart and work hard, Malays hate them.  The nazi had been born in Australia, but was shorter and darker.</p>
<p>The running joke was that the nazi was an Indonesian, or didn&rsquo;t know how to use chopsticks, or that my co-worker was too Asian.</p>
<p>They took me out to dinner the evening I left, at an all-you-can-eat buffet, with the usual banter between them.  I miss those guys.  It has been ten years.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t use their names here, but the nazi was feeding pork to the Muslims in his lab.  He&rsquo;d bring rissoles some mornings, and share them out.  These are a sort of meat pastry.  He told the Muslims it was veal.  It wasn&rsquo;t.  His great-grandfather was in Chiang Kai-Shek&rsquo;s equivalent of the Gestapo.  I brought him a kevlar helmet after a return to the US in 1998.  I also brought him a vest I wore through customs.  It wasn&rsquo;t a PASGT vest because I couldn&rsquo;t find one small enough, so I got him a vehicle crewman&rsquo;s vest.  Even my mother didn&rsquo;t know I was wearing it until she hugged me at the airport.  He loved America and firearms and visited US ships that came to Sydney, especially aircraft cariers.  I think he wished he was white.</p>
<p>He thought about selling it once, but his grandfather told him to keep it.  </p>
<p>It was my hope to take him shooting in the US someday, but he hasn&rsquo;t been here, and I can&rsquo;t have access to my gun collection.  I have only a gauss rifle, the second I built.  The first is in Japanese SDF hands to be evaluated.</p>
<p>Exaggerating the small differences between we whites and the people most like us doesn&rsquo;t help anything.  My wife and I have a Welsh flag, green and white with the red dragon on it, and a Confederate flag, the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia.  My wife is about as anti-China and anti-Communist as it is possible to be, but allowing folks a little celebration and pride is a harmless thing.  Yes, they&rsquo;re Chinese, and I am mostly Celtic.  When I was in Australia I flew the Confederate stars and bars over my door.</p>
<p>Whites made north America and Australia attractive places to live, but it is normal for recent immigrants to a country to have a sense of identity and be proud of who they are.  My attitude toward my friends was that they were whites who had eyes that looked a little different from mine.  I consider myself male first, Celtic second, American third, and white a long way down the list.  </p>
<p>If the CSA was hosting the Olympics in Richmond, Virginia, or Scotland in Edinburgh, or Wales in Cardiff, or Ireland in Dublin, I&rsquo;d be out waving a flag as well.</p>

			<p>     The Han Chinese are the most racist people in the world. Whereever they are allowed to live; they soon dominate commerce. This is done by clannish behavior and their intelligence.Ask the Fillipinos,Malaysians,Burmese,Indonesians,Vietnamese,Laotians and the Russians (Siberians). It&rsquo;s said to see Australia going down that dark road to extinction.</p>

			<p><i>China won its independence in 1949, and has maintained that independence against two of the greastest superpowers the world has ever seen - the US and Soviet Union.</i> - John Liu</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s odd - I don&rsquo;t recall either the US or the USSR attempting to invade and conquer China recently. If the US were on an imperial streak we could&rsquo;ve kept Japan and Western Europe after WW2, Korea after the war there, Kuwait, Grenada, etc.</p>
<p>China hasn&rsquo;t maintained its independence out of any particular brilliance. It&rsquo;s done so because there&rsquo;s just so damn many of them, and because free trade has replaced colonialism as the preferred economic system.</p>
<p>One of these days the white nations of the world are going to open their eyes and realize that the Chinese have been pursuing an invasion-via-immigration policy for sometime. When that happens, the billion-plus people of China will be stuck where they are - and they won&rsquo;t be happy.</p>

			<p><i>Whites made north America and Australia attractive places to live, but it is normal for recent immigrants to a country to have a sense of identity and be proud of who they are.</i></p>
<p>Indeed - that&rsquo;s why numbers matter. A small number of Asians can enrich the flavor of society. A large number and suddenly they want to replace your culture with theirs, replace your political beliefs with theirs.</p>
<p>Genes matter. They shape the kind of society we want, believe it or not. Witness the recent study where Asian babies and European babies were placed faced down in their cribs. The Asian babies stayed put. The European babies rolled over. We have yet to truly understand how deep or profound these differences are. Suffice it to say that life, culture, society and politics are significantlydiffernt in Asia than in the West.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cliche, I know, but many of my best friends in high school and college were Asian. Some still are. I loved them, their intelligence, their culture. But I would not, do not, will not see their culture supplant mine through mass immigration. They came here because they wanted to, and because we let them. If they don&rsquo;t like it they should go back - Asia, after all, is the biggest damn continent on the planet. There&rsquo;s plenty of room for them there, and if there isn&rsquo;t then it ain;t my fault.</p>

			<p><i>It was whites who were responsible for rebuilding Japan and their economy after WW2. Japan in the most heavily westernized nation in all of Asia.</i></p>
<p>You are of course correct here. That is why you no longer fear Japan. Japan is a US lackey.</p>
<p>China, apart from some Soviet aid in the 1950s, pulled itself up by its own efforts. In the past twenty years, wealth of the average Chinese person has increased twenty-fold. Obviously some Westerners are uncomfortable with this - thus all this &#8220;Free Tibet&#8221; rubbish - obviously they do not really care for Tibetans - everything about keeping non-whites down.</p>

			<p> Alan you are right, Chinese are the most sneaky crafty people in the world. They fooled us Indians in 1962, saying &#8216;Hindi Chini bhai bhai&rsquo; meaning Indians and Chinese are brothers in Hindi and attacked us the very next day. Tibet a part of China, hah. Tibet was always a part of AkhandBharat. Tibet was deeply influenced by India. During Indian independence ceremony in 1947, Tibet sent it&rsquo;s own dimplomats at the event.<br>
 I think China had too many people in 1962 and thus wanted to cull themselves by pitting themselves against the brave jawans of the Indian army.<br>

<p>India seeks better relations with China but the past is not forgotten. We forgive but will never forget. Leave Indian teretory and give Tibet it&rsquo;s freedom.</p>

			<p>Mr Lieu, Japan built itself up into a great power well before 1941.  They were treated as a major player in the naval disarmament treaties of the early 1920s.  They did it by their own labor.  Yes, they bought Western technology, but so what?  China didn&rsquo;t invent the airplane, and neither did England, all countries learn from other countries.  Nobody gave them any modern technology for free before WW2.  Japan was, unmistakably, the first modern Asian power, regardless of their present foreign policy.  Attacking the U.S. Pacific Fleet was hardly the act of a lickspittle.  You have a poor grasp of historical chronology, Mr Lieu.  Perhaps your Chinese chauvinism has trumped your knowledge of the calendar.  <br>

<p> &#8220;the west no longer fears Japan&#8221;,,,</p>
<p> That&rsquo;s funny. I thought Japan invaded and occupied China for many years and was only ultimately defeated by the west, particularly the U.S. I think the truth is China no longer has to fear Japan BECAUSE of the west. Not that I expect any gratitude from you. </p>
<p> Your comments about the west using Tibet as a Trojan horse to undermine China are ludicrous. Almost all protesters I have seen on the news are ethnic Tibetans, a consequence of liberal western immigration policies.</p>
<p> BY THE WAY you never DID answer my question? Do you live in China or the west? The answer says a lot more about you then it does about me or any other poster on AmRen. If I had a dollar for every Oriental who ever told me how great their country was, how wonderful their culture is, how much better eastern ways are, but somehow, is alwasy choosing to live in a WESTERN country, I&rsquo;d be rich.</p>

			<p>John, the basic problem with China is that it is entirely dependent on selling to the West. You have no other outlet for any of your products. Think about that&hellip;if America wasn&rsquo;t so fetishistic about free trade, so willing to sacrifice its own industries for the sake of China, where would China be? Where would you sell your Chinese junk once Americans decide that they really don&rsquo;t need plasma screens and protectionism becomes the ruling ideology? Where is the &#8220;alternative United States&#8221; you could use to dump your products? Answer: Nowhere. Your people are too poor to buy anything that China produces and your nation does not have the legal traditions of property rights and the rule of law to create the kind of domestic market economies that create real wealth. You will forever be a society of slave laborers supplying international markets over which you have no control.</p>
<p>And&hellip;no&hellip;white, Western countries don&rsquo;t fear you. We don&rsquo;t have to. Japan fears you&hellip;Thailand fears you&hellip;Taiwan fears you&hellip;Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia&hellip;all fear you. India and Russia fear you&hellip;or, at least, don&rsquo;t trust you. They ring your territory and share your water access. Their hatred and manpower combined with American resources and Japanese technology guarantee that Chinese arrogance will be met with deadly force&hellip;and that your land will one day be carved up by victorious powers. Heck, America could bring down China by simply raising the price of food!</p>
<p>John, you make the mistake of believing the US media and the American corporate stooges when they talk about the &#8220;Asian century&#8221; and the &#8220;Chinese presence in the global economy.&#8221; You fail to realize that there is no global economy and that China is merely America&rsquo;s economy extended globally&hellip;one that we could easily do without.</p>
<p>Yes, you can have all the pride that you want&hellip;just remember, the Soviet economy looked very impressive back in 1970, too. </p>

			<p>I agree with Mr Lui that the &#8220;Free Tibet&#8221; issue is aload of rubbish and Tibet is now an integral part of China. However the Chinese economy has developed due to foreign companies moving there for cheap labour reasons, if nationalism and protectionism grip the world the Chinese economy will slip hugely. As for the destruction of Tibeten monastries all places of worship were closed or smashed during the cultural revolution, but some freedom of religion is allowed in China now hence the huge growth in Buddhism and Christianity.   </p>

<p>It is like a buch of Englishmen attacking Indian freedom fighters in South Africa or a bunch of Dutchmen attacking Indonesian freedom fighters in Spain before 1945. Jasper is right, there is a big difference between Whites and Asians as far as guilt is concerned.</p>

			<p>As an Indian I can see Mr Liu gets his history from Chairman Mao&rsquo;s little Red Book. Every country that borders China doesn&rsquo;t trust her. As for the west posing a threat to China, wasn&rsquo;t it America&rsquo;s so called lackey Japan that did all those awful things in Manchuria and attacked Pearl Harbour, wasn&rsquo;t it the Soviets that helped liberate China from Japanese occupation?    </p>

			<p>The main advantages China has is just a massive pool of extremely cheap labour and draconian labour laws. The pollution in the country is terrible. Every person I know who has ever been to China has always told me that. The rivers are like sewers.</p>

<p>I find it funny that you mention &#8220;American resources&#8221; and &#8220;Japanese technology&#8221;. The Japanese only produce technology that suits their nation as well as small gadgets.  Americans specialize in larger technology that matters, such as for the military and space.</p>

<p>I read an article in Newsweek printed version a few weeks back.  It was about the recent Japanese slump, and the fact that there haven&rsquo;t been any world-beating internationally popular Japanese electronic or gadget innovations in two decades.  It said that when the global internet was starting to become popular, ca. 1995, that the Japanese couldn&rsquo;t comprehend why, because they didn&rsquo;t see the necessity in communicating in anyway outside of your small click of familiar folk (including business), or at most outside Japan.  The Japanese have some great and technologically advanced gadgets that sell great within Japan, and appeal to Japanese sensibilities   &mdash;   but flunk outside of Japan.  Meanwhile, Nokia and Apple are dominating most of the rest of the world, but not Japan.</p>
<p>They caught onto the internet, but while, their domestic broadband speeds within Japan are the best in the world, an American will constantly get better speed tests to Europe than Japan.</p>
<p>That insularity will mean that there will be a Japan in 2100, but there won&rsquo;t be a USA or UK, at least not one recognizable to today&rsquo;s Americans and Britons.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;free Tibet&#8221; bit is because just as Belgium once deserved to be free of Spain, and once as Poland deserved to be free of Russia, Austria and Germany, Tibet also deserves to be free.  If you let them go, they might even be your friends on their own, someday.</p>

			<p>What I find interesting and noteworthy is that the Chinese protestors are not the uneducated rural peasants but the educated young, presumably internet-savvy ones. What a blow this must be to all those western liberals and universalists who believe that the modernization of China will lead to democracy and China becoming a &#8220;good-guy&#8221; country like any other western democracy. The very people the western liberals had counted on leading China into a brave new world of being a &#8220;liberal&#8221; country with &#8220;universalist&#8221; values are spitting in their face. Nationalism is the ethos of the Han Chinese mentality. They are not going to be America&rsquo;s &#8220;partner&#8221; in some global new world order. China is going to do its own thing. What a shock to all those liberals who think that creating democracy etc, is the &#8220;answer&#8221; to everything. The universalists just don&rsquo;t understand that other people don&rsquo;t share their values. Universalism is not, well universal. This flawed thinking also played a role in creating the Iraq disaster. Just turn Iraq into a democracy and all our problems will be solved. The idea that the various peoples who comprise Iraq may have ideas of their own and may not be reading from the same script never entered into the heads of those Washington &#8220;universalists&#8221; and their &#8220;freedom Agenda&#8221;.</p>
