<h1>Congo Plane Crashes at End of Runway and Bursts Into Flames</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charles Ntirycha, AP, April 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Congolese jetliner with about 85 people on board failed to take off Tuesday from an airport in this eastern town, slamming into a busy market neighborhood at the end of the runway and bursting into flames, officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The tragedy underscored the dangers of plane travel in Congo, which has experienced more fatal crashes than any other African country since 1945, according to the Aviation Safety Network.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The plane was operated by the private Congolese company, Hewa Bora, and was headed to the central city of Kisangani, then the capital, Kinshasa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Employees at World Vision said the plane &#8220;failed to leave the ground,&#8221; plowing instead &#8220;through wooden houses and shops in the highly populated Birere market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plane appeared to have been &#8220;totally flattened&#8221; by the impact, said Rachel Wolff, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for the organization who has been in contact with her colleagues in Congo.</p>
<p>A former pilot who survived the crash, Dunia Sindani, gave a similar account in an interview broadcast over a local U.N. radio station. The plane suffered a problem in one of its wheels &mdash; possibly a flat tire &mdash; and did not gain the strength to lift off, Sindani said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just last Friday, the European Union added Hewa Bora Airways to its blacklist of airlines banned from flying in the EU, without specifying a reason.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, European Union spokesman Michele Cercone said she had no information on Hewa Bora specifically but she said that all airlines based in Congo are banned from EU air space.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is because there is a general lack of effective control by the civil aviation authorities there to monitor and maintain minimum technical standards&#8221; for airplanes, Cercone said.</p>
