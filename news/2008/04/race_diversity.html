<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>This third London Mayoral contest will be by far the closest run yet. It&rsquo;ll also be the bitterest.</p>
<p>Of course, a bittersweet dynamic of this fierce contest should lead to a better-than-average voter turnout &mdash; crucial if the BNP are to be denied any Greater London Assembly seats.</p>
<p>But my worry is that many Londoners will be left feeling &lsquo;don&rsquo;t we deserve a better contest than this?&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous two mayoral elections race has taken centre stage and I&rsquo;m sorry that it has because London generally has a lower level of racial tension than we have seen in recent years in Paris, Bradford, or Birmingham.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years, particularly in the last 50, the capital&rsquo;s teeming diversity has been its strength. Diversity won us the 2012 Olympic games. But that&rsquo;s not to say there aren&rsquo;t tensions, or that tackling race inequality is no longer a priority.</p>
<p>The fact is that for the vast majority of people living in the capital, particularly the young, their identity as a Londoner is worn as a badge of honour. The identity of race and religion are not diminished, however, whether or not you are born here; the inclusive nature of London is very appealing.</p>
<p>The biggest problem young Londoners face is not a racial divide but rather a territorial division that pits one neighbourhood against another &mdash; that&rsquo;s a serious problem for any mayor.</p>
<p>The capital&rsquo;s identity politics, as in the politics of voting, also takes on a life of its own. When the novelist Jeffrey Archer began his ill-fated quest to become the capital&rsquo;s first Mayor he made it his business to schlep all over the capital in an attempt to win over potential voters.</p>
<p>He courted the black vote so much that it was said he would go to the opening of a fridge if he knew there would be a black audience. It began to pay dividends. Archer would tell anyone who would listen, that he was not like his then exceedingly unpopular Conservative Party.</p>
<p>His politics, he argued, were &lsquo;for a world beating multicultural city, dynamic as they are different from the &lsquo;run of the mill politics&rsquo;. In a poll commissioned by Operation Black Vote (OBV) back in 1999 asking black communities who they would vote for as Mayor, Archer beat Livingstone, Trevor Phillips, and Susan Kramer. The next Tory candidate Steve Norris continued Archer&rsquo;s narrative that celebrated multicultural London.</p>
<p>So, why has race negatively come to the forefront this time around? There are two main factors. The first has been the wholly disproportionate attention towards Ken Livingstone&rsquo;s former equality aide Lee Jasper, and a number of black groups and individuals, including Doreen Lawrence and Pastor Nims.</p>
<p>No-one in the black community condones financial wrongdoing but many have asked, was the scale of this focus on these allegations fair, and how come everyone targeted by this media onslaught just happens to be black?</p>
<p>The second element has come from Boris Johnson himself. His remarks about Africans and Africa have forced him to make an unreserved apology. Johnson has had to learn quickly that the politics of London demands that it&rsquo;s not enough not being a racist, you have to be a passionate anti-racist.</p>
<p>There is a third racial element, which until last week largely went ignored. The Ken v Boris Punch and Judy Show has focused attention away from the politics of race hatred: BNP. Masquerading as democrats, and even courting their once archenemies &mdash; the Jewish community &mdash; the BNP are hoping their claim that they are no longer bigoted boot boys will win acceptance.</p>
<p>If they can keep up the charade, and there is a low voter turnout, the BNP would hope to pick up one or two Assembly seats. The result would be disastrous for London. The very essence of what brings people to London from all over the world to a multi-cultural metropolis would be threatened by politics that has its roots in fascism.</p>
<p>Some commentators have suggested the BNP&rsquo;s success might not be a bad thing as it would shake up the mainstream parties. I disagree. Any far right political success directly translates into racial abuse, verbally and physically. Worse still their bigoted ideas would, even more, seep into mainstream thinking.</p>
<p>Last week, the mainstream candidates stopped attacking each other to unite against the threat of the BNP.</p>
<p>Speaking at OBV&rsquo;s coalition against the BNP, Boris Johnson declared that Londoners must register to vote and defeat the BNP. Ken Livingstone argued that as well as attacking the capital&rsquo;s cultural identity the BNP&rsquo;s racial hatred &lsquo;would turn visitors away&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I agree with both of them and would add that, if we value what we have in London, lets protect it on May 1st.</p>
<p>Simon Woolley is the director and a founder of Operation Black Vote.<br>

			<p>Is this article crafted out of pure truisms, platitudes, and name calling?  Who wrote this, a 5 year old?  Anyone could have said this, it&rsquo;s just more of the same completely meaningless baseless assertions.</p>
<p>If you oppose someone taking your land and displacing your children: you&rsquo;re a racist.</p>
<p>If you support invading someone else&rsquo;s land and displacing their children: you&rsquo;re a dynamic diverse strength.</p>
<p>Muslims are inclusive and proud to be integrated Londoners, as shown by their london bus bombings, continuous sharia creep, and crime rates.</p>
<p>It is bigots, ie, the people still old enough to remember defeating Hitler and ruling a world empire with peace, justice, and prosperity for all beyond anything they could do themselves, who &#8216;drive tourists away&rsquo; and &#8216;ruin the reputation of London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just keep yapping!  Who are you fooling?  BNP grows by the day.  And when they do take power, I hope someday all the traitors will be called to account for their actions.</p>

			<p>Yawn. More soft-headed liberal wishful thinking. </p>
<p>&#8220;For hundreds of years, particularly in the last 50, the capital&rsquo;s teeming diversity has been its strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>What has this guy been smoking? London has been a multicult paradise for &#8220;hundreds of years&#8221;? This proves that these people are mentally deranged. They worship an ideology that they will mentally re-write history to preserve.  </p>

&#8220;No-one in the black community condones financial wrongdoing&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;except of course all those hundreds of thousands of blacks locked up for various financial wrongdoings. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;But that&rsquo;s not to say there aren&rsquo;t tensions, or that tackling race inequality is no longer a priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;race inequality&#8221; and reverse-discrimination with which Red Ken, NuLabor, and their co-conspirators on the Left have been using for decades TO BEAT DOWN WHITE BRITONS is precisely what&rsquo;s fuelling the rise of the British National Party. It&rsquo;s having been reduced to second-class citizens in their own land that&rsquo;s turning thousands of indigenous British men and women into Nick Griffin supporters. </p>
<p>Go BNP! Take back the capital   &mdash;   and then take back the country! England for the English!<br>

<p> NO. For hundreds of years London&rsquo;s and Britain&rsquo;s strength was its racial homogeneity. No race riots, little crime, no suicide bombers on buses and trains etc,,</p>

In the six months I lived in London, I was mugged, my &#8220;flat&#8221; (apartment) was burglarized and once I even got punched square in the face. </p>
<p>Therefore I now formally announce my refusal to revisit the city until a BNP mayor is elected. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the Socialist Multicult that has it&rsquo;s roots in Fascism. These liars are sooner or later going to have to recognise that Fascism is a variety of Extreme Leftwing ideology that was <br>
re-labelled &#8216;Rightwing&rsquo; by Stalin.  It&rsquo;s Socialists  who practice racial abuse, verbal and physical against those races they despise ie, Whites, and to varying degrees, the Jews. Worse still their bigoted ideas have seeped into mainstream thinking.</p>

			<p>I think its racist to purposely negate the Anglo race in its core habitation, whether by displacement or miscegination, but if the majority of anglo&rsquo;s desire this,  perhaps its a just form of racism. Let the men of the house have their choice in furnishings.</p>

			<p>Strange how the election of partisan Black and Asian candidates is celebrated as reflecting the Diversity of London whereas the election of a candidate working for the indiginous people of London is Fascist.</p>
<p>Does anyone see the the racist agenda in that situation?</p>
<p>Black is good and white is evil. </p>
<p>Many Boroughs are now minority white - the indiginous population effectively having been &#8220;cleansed&#8221; from the area - leaving only the poor and elderly to suffer in isolation.</p>

			<p>The author flat out states that both mainstream parties have closed ranks to deny the BNP any influence.  Whatever happened to the old fashioned notion of representatives that act in accordance with the wishes of their electorate?</p>
<p>In the late 1990&rsquo;s the two major political parties in the Queensland, Australia state election closed ranks in exactly the same way against the nationalist One Nation party.  Despite getting over 10% of the primary vote, One Nation did not gain any seats in state parliament.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Any far right political success directly translates into racial abuse, verbally and physically.&#8221;</p>
<p>The corollary to that, is that any far left success directly translates into racial abuse of whites, verbally, physically and legally. Fortunately for us, the left hasn&rsquo;t had any success over the last 60 years&hellip;</p>
<p>Forgeting politics for a moment&hellip; just the physical presence of people of color seems to translate into all that and worse. </p>

			<p>It would &#8220;turn visitors away&#8221;, now would it?</p>
<p>I was just in London. It would have been nice to meet and talk to English people there.  It would have been nice to get a drink at the pub and see a football game among people of the English persuasion.</p>
<p>It would have been really nice to feel comfortable, and not stared down and threatened, for being a white woman and NOT in a burqa.  I&rsquo;m not kidding- it was pretty hostile.  I have family there.  They are miserable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to London several times, since I was a kid.  This last trip, I pretty much decided would be my last.</p>
<p>Goodbye, my mother country!  I&rsquo;ll probably never visit you, or my family there, ever again!</p>

			<p>I urge you Amreners to study up on sales and persuasion as well as marketing.  It&rsquo;s fun, interesting reading.  And vital to our success in retaining our homelands.  Because you know the opposing mush-head folks are using it now as we speak.</p>
<p>I urge you to start posting on forums and discussion boards everywhere.  The Internet is flooded with discussion boards and forums like this one.  Post on blogs too.</p>
<p>Face it, aside from prayer and having lots of kids this is all we&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>We have a right to our homelands and to our culture.  We have a right to live in safe prosperous communities that foster our culture.</p>
<p>Go to these discussion boards and don&rsquo;t tear down the black man or whoever.  We don&rsquo;t care about that.  What we care about is securing a future for our genetic group.  Take a stand against multi-cultural mush-heads and diversity fanatics.  Explain why their point of view is fraught with error and endangers us all.</p>
<p>Start from where your target audience is and lead them to something they haven&rsquo;t known before.  Don&rsquo;t argue, don&rsquo;t confront, just pace and then lead them.</p>
<p>Ask them, &#8220;Has anyone ever told you that Europeans are only 12% of the global population and will be just 9.76% by 2050?&#8221;  &#8220;Ask them what will it be like being one of the few pale faces around in such and such city or region?&#8221;</p>
<p>Listen, if you don&rsquo;t make an effort each day to get out and post on these boards then what have you done for your genetic group?  Because every day that passes is a day things get worse and beyond hope.  Making these posts is fun and it&rsquo;s easy and it makes you feel like you&rsquo;ve done something and yes, you&rsquo;ll open eyes too.  </p>

			<p>And further to my comments above about the flat out rejection of the wishes of the electorate: anti-racists, multicults and the like always say &#8220;If you want to reduce immigration, vote for someone who will do that!&#8221;.  What inevitably happens is that mainstream parties close ranks, no nationalists are elected, and the left wing uses this fact as evidence that this is a fringe movement only supported by a couple of white low class stereotypes!</p>
<p>See, the democratic process is of no concern to those who push these neo-Marxist agendas.  Nor is science, equality, cultural preservation etc.</p>

<p>&gt; This paragraph is full of amazing poses of propaganda.</p>
<p>  &#8220;For hundreds of years..&#8221;  What??  London has been a white dominant city for hundreds of year!  It is only in the past 50 - post WW2 period that this has been changing, much to London&rsquo;s loss.  &#8220;Diversity won us the 2012 Olympic Games&hellip;&#8221;  Oh really, is that also what gave them to China?</p>
<p>By creating pretentious claims in sentences aimed at even another political point, these types of writers create a fantasy world for one another that they gobble up without ever asking if the premises are true or not.  Accepting the pretences of such writing creates a disinformation base that is then built upon for further manipulation of the reader.</p>
<p>Whites be vigilant!</p>

<p>The blacks feeding at the trough supplied to them by the avowed Marxist mayor Ken Livimgston certainly condoned it as the lavish foreign holidays &amp; other perks they enjoyed amply testifies. Through taxpayer-funded organisations like Operation Black Vote [OBV] which trawled through the black immigration communities signing-up housefulls of Nigerians [18 bodies in some cases] brought into the UK for just the purpose of being voting fodder for the criminal elite. It allowed these &#8216;black community activists&rsquo; to sample all these delights at the expense of the genuine taxpayers of lefty-run Zimbabwe-on-the-Thames as long as the black vote was secured. These cultural marxist enablers are the real racists. But it is no surprise that a journalist from the lefty rag New Stateman, like all liberal/marxists, parrots the mantra &amp; Big Lie &#8216;for hundreds of years &hellip; i.e. it&rsquo;s always been like that&rsquo; while leaving unsaid the unspoken corollary &#8216;&hellip; so there&rsquo;s nothing you or anybody else can do about it. &amp; the sad thing is the majority of young whites have been brainwashed into believing this.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t have a clue what is wrong with the British.  Whites in America have already started voicing loud opinions on the situation we face here.  We are all over mainstream radio and our voices are now coming out in the TVs.  Politicians have followed suit.  We still need the clergy to demand white civil rights.  They either will march with us or eventually find their pews empty.  America is sovereign and we don&rsquo;t want foreigners here.  They are all getting it now.   We are sovereign, Britain is sovereign or we are nothing.  Tell them they are not welcomed and need to go home.  Demand action for repatriation.  Demand reparations from their home countries for the costs incurred and even the crime and oppression we natives suffer at the hands of foreigners who come here demanding like the colonialist and imperialists they are!!! Enough!!! Out!!!</p>
