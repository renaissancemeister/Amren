						<p>With his 28-year grip on power slipping, President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s government has again lashed out at Zimbabwe&rsquo;s white community, calling his black opponents tools of former colonial master Britain and stoking anger against the nation&rsquo;s whites.</p>
<p>In the past, such attacks struck a chord in a country that suffered under white minority rule until 1980 and where whites controlled much of the economy even decades later.</p>
<p>But after repeated attacks, the seizure of most white-owned farms and the near collapse of the economy, the white community&rsquo;s size and power have dwindled. It may no longer be effective to use whites as a scapegoat for the nation&rsquo;s ills.</p>
<p>Attacking the nation&rsquo;s whites is &#8220;the last card&#8221; Mugabe has in his fight for political survival, analyst John Makumbe said. &#8220;He has nothing else to offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Following the vote, which he reportedly lost though the results have yet to be released, Mugabe again turned to the racial issue, telling Zimbabweans that the land taken from the white farmers was under threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;This our soil, and the soil must never go back to the whites,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Since then, ruling party militants have invaded scores of the farms still owned by whites. The opposition says the attacks are part of a wave of intimidation by Mugabe loyalists meant to ensure that the president does not lose an expected runoff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looting is taking place. It is a free-for-all. Farmers are being told they are enemies of the state. There is no more discussion than that,&#8221; said Trevor Gifford, head of the mainly white farmers&rsquo; union.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, there are only 30,000 whites left out of a population of about 12 million &mdash; though an estimated 5 million Zimbabweans, black and white, have fled as economic fugitives and political exiles.</p>
<p>Many of the remaining whites are retirees finding it nearly impossible to live on their meager pensions with the official inflation rate of 100,000 percent, the highest in the world. Independent financial firms say real inflation is closer to 290,000 percent.</p>
<p>One white retiree in the Alexandra Park suburb of northern Harare said his monthly pension does not buy him a loaf of bread, and he survives on handouts from relatives abroad.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>White enclaves such as tennis, sports and social clubs, have largely disappeared. Whites no longer display what affluence they retain, fearing it will make them targets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, increasing numbers of whites are suffering stress-related conditions, respiratory illness and alcohol abuse, doctors said.</p>
<p>Mugabe&rsquo;s allies in the ruling party, with their luxury cars, ornate mansions and access to state-subsidized fuel and special rates for buying hard currency, now sit atop the economy.</p>
<p>Businessman and former ruling party lawmaker Philip Chiyangwa owns a Hummer even though gasoline is almost impossible for ordinary Zimbabweans to find. He boasted in the state media recently that he installed a computerized color-coded wardrobe for matching hundreds of suits, shoes and fashion accessories at his 30-room home in the exclusive Harare suburb of Borrowdale.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many black farm workers seen as opposition supporters are being intimidated, and several black-owned farms have been raided, witnesses said.</p>

			<p> Wheres the U.N.? Just what does the N stand for in U.N. This is obviously Americas future. Brigit Bardot can,t even talk about the problems in France without being fined but they can steal the white farmers property with the blessing of the government in Zimland. Diversity is not embraced in that country so why does France and America have to put up with this diversity disaster?</p>

<p>Oh, spare me!  Rhodesia &#8220;suffered&#8221; under white rule?  It was the second most prosperous country in Africa, at least before the Mugabe guerrilla war took its toll, and starvation was unknown.  I guarantee that the vast majority of Zimbabweans would gladly go back to those days.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;This our soil, and the soil must never go back to the whites,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most horrible revenge whites could ever inflict on them would be to refuse, under any circumstances, for any reason, far any incentive, reward etc. to EVER return.</p>
<p>Well, they might return after they all die.  That won&rsquo;t take long, based on what&rsquo;s going on now.</p>

			<p>   In 1739 England went to war with Spain because the Spainards had cut an ear off an english sea captain.  Too bad white nations are no longer willing to take up for thier own kind.  It would be so easy to relieve the plight of whites in Zimbabwe and other subsahara African countries.</p>

			<p>Good Lord&hellip; These black &#8220;leaders&#8221; are so racist and fascist and incompetent.  What is going to happen to the World when the typical World leader is more like Mugabe than Eisenhower?  Zimbabwe used to have the most advanced agricultural economy in Africa, and the blacks have turn it to total garbage in less than a decade.  </p>

			<p>Mugabe, as stated in the article, is using the last card in his deck to survive: the White Bogeyman. I think that the Bogeyman theory will work, at least in the short term&hellip;because of the utter credulity of Blacks when it comes to anti-White conspiracy theories&hellip;A credulity ruthlessly exploited by thugs like Mugabe who use it to enrich themselves or entrench their power. We see this not only in Africa, but in North America, where it has been raised to an art form by leaders of Blacks like the various Reverends Farakan, Sharpton, Jackson, ect. In short, Blacks will believe any lie about Whites, no matter how outlandish or incredible.</p>
<p>There is a conspiracy by Britain to undermine the Great Leader Mugabe&hellip;yeah right. The lefties in Britain and Canada actualy supported and cheered Mugabe and his rise to power. As a Canadian I vividly remember the accolades showered upon this murdering, racist thug terrorist by our political and media elites, especialy the Marxist Canadian icon Steven Lewis. Lewis, the former Canadian Ambassador to the U.N and now the Secretary General&rsquo;s &#8220;special envoy&#8221; for HIV/AIDS in Africa, was among the most vocal gobsmacked supporters of Mugabe around 1984, when he took power in Zim.</p>
<p>Even today Lewis tries to make the case that all of Mugabe&rsquo;s problems (and those of Africa as a whole) are the fault of White Westerners due to &#8220;hundreds of years of oppression&#8221; and the after effects of colonialism.</p>
<p>It is people like this sick neo-Marxist elitist Lewis who will never, ever place the blame for Africa&rsquo;s abysmal, unbelievably wretched condition on the shoulders of the people who bear the real responsability: Africans themselves. At the same time, this allows him to continue to extort money and aid from the perpetually guilty Whites and throw it at the perpetual Black victims.</p>
<p>It is White enablers of African monsters like Mugabe (and countless others) who bear a large share of the blame for the dispossesion and genocide of Whites in Africa. </p>

			<p>The next natural event to occur in Zimbabwe is the return of canabalism. </p>
<p>Since the Africans are de-industrializing their nation (no other race performs this phenonema), the final end-point is canabalism. </p>
<p>It will be the whites they will kill for food.</p>

			<p>I was doing a search of a small country in West African, and it mentioned there, in that country around 1994, was the first time a head of state in Africa peacefully stepped down from office after an election. I couldn&rsquo;t believe the first time ever was in the 1990&rsquo;s. Who knew it would be one of the last times, too?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think this is the case.  I have read stories of whites in South Africa, that came to the states, paying their own way, but asking for political asylum.  It wasn&rsquo;t granted.  Someone else on here may know more than I.  Please advise.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Now, there are only 30,000 whites left out of a population of about 12 million&hellip;an estimated 5 million Zimbabweans, black and white, have fled as economic fugitives and political exiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, the further vicissitudes of that most revered african black messiah, Robert Mugabe. Obviously, the people of Zimbabwe still fail to appreciate the complex genius hiding beneath this man&rsquo;s canny leadership. </p>
<p>If only they realized that his strategy of brutality, land theft, general economic collapse, and mass poverty and starvation deliberately forced on the nation was the single most certain method of finally ridding the place of all its white devils. </p>
<p>Cheer up Zimabaweans, doubtless it will all be over soon. </p>

			<p>This has an interesting historical parallel: Haiti.  During the French colonial days, Haiti was the wealthiest colony in the New World.  Most of the sugar, tobacco and cotton sold in France at the time was produced in Haiti.  The only prolonged period of relative order in Haiti since then was when the US Marines were running the place.  </p>
<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s future is not Haiti, though.  Haiti benefits from its proximity to the United States; because of the location, the US is forced to pay attention to Haiti.  Zimbabwe, on the other hand, is landlocked and located in a pretty irrelevant area.  Zimbabwe will be much poorer than Haiti.</p>

This country suffered under white rule? please elaborate and tell us what great and wonderful changes that make this Marxist nation better today than in 1980. It must be the integration that has brought this one oppressive nation into the great and prosperous black paradise we see today under the sagacious leadership of Black rule. Perhaps this same leadership will come from the Black manufactured messiah Obama right here in the United States.<br>
One white retiree in the Alexandra Park suburb of northern Harare said his monthly pension does not buy him a loaf of bread, and he survives on handouts from relatives abroad.<br>
This is obviously a &lsquo;white&rdquo; lie, communism under a black potentate such as Mugabe is loving, kind and benevolent and would not allow this to happen to white people, communism would not allow suffering in this abyss of goodness!<br>
Well it&rsquo;s just as well if the remaining white population left Mugabe&rsquo;s abyss if they cannot live on the kindness of Black love, how un grateful these white people are.<br>

<p>I guess you don&rsquo;t live in the States.  The public policy of de-industrialization of the united States of America has been proceeding at speed since 1973.</p>
<p>Since our industrial base is so much larger than Zim&rsquo;s, it will take much longer to get the deed finished.  Maybe then, we remaining whites should look around us for the cannibalism from our black &#8216;Peers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Perhaps cannibalism was the only thing the Knoxville thugs spared Christian and Newsome.  But what do we know?  The trial proceeds and maybe we will have still more surprises?</p>

			<p>Knowing of the tremendous ability of the white Rhodesians regarding their advanced armament and training, I&rsquo;m a bit surprised that we haven&rsquo;t been hearing of white subversives making guerilla style raids on the existing authority.</p>
<p>I can only guess that the reasons for the absence of that is because any white victories wouldn&rsquo;t be supported by the West, since it is now controlled by gutless wonders who are more concerned about profit than doing what is right.</p>
<p>But, still, I wouldn&rsquo;t rule out white guerilla groups in Rhodesia and certainly not in South Africa.</p>
<p>When the West implodes from racial clashes, it&rsquo;s very likely we will see Rhodesia and South Africa burst into action as well.  </p>

			<p>If there were no Whites, WHO or WHAT would Africans blame their collective failures on?</p>
<p>It is worth thinking about. The Black African people of today are the end-result of well over 50,000 years of evolution, development and mental growth. Need I say any more? These Blacks got their start around the same geologic time we Whites did. Look at them and see for yourself, the vast difference between the two racial groups.</p>

<p>&gt; What are you complaining about, Black Zims or Jews?  But there is little real comparison to the plight of Jews in Europe 1933-1945, as Mugabe hasn&rsquo;t constructed holding pens for whites or cells for gassing them to death, etc.  From what I have heard on the BBC, many whites have left both Zim and SA and live in many Commonwealth countries.  During Nazi Germany, Jews were prevented from leaving and those that did were welcomed nowhere.</p>

			<p>Whiteplight at 7:59 PM: Jews were allowed to leave Nazi Germany at least until 1938.  Of the 525,000 Jews in Germany, 280,000 left, of which 240,000 came to the U.S.  This is according to the Jewish British historian and Winston Churchill&rsquo;s official biographer, Martin Gilbert. </p>

			<p>Whiteplight is wrong, Jews were allowed to leave Germany but many rightfully saw germany as their country and so didn&rsquo;t. Hitler&rsquo;s hatred was toward the slavic people and hence slavic Jews, the Jews in Nazi occupied France mainly survived. </p>

<p>Hitler also gave the US the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Robert Oppenheimer:  German Jewish<br>
Albert Einstein:  German Jewish<br>
Edward Teller:  German Jewish<br>
Leo Szilard:  Hungarian Jewish<br>
Enrico Fermi:  Italian Christian with a Jewish wife</p>
<p>One of Germany&rsquo;s highest-scoring WW-1 aces was Jewish.  Werner Voss downed 48 Allied airplanes, and alone, he gave No. 56 Squardron a hard fight before Arthur P.F. Rhys-Davids shot him down.  Even Hermann Goering was unable to have Voss stricken from the honor roll.</p>
<p>Rhys-Davids would only live another month, but exclaimed, &#8220;If only I could have brought him down alive!&#8221;</p>
<p>Voss once claimed he was a better pilot than von Richtoffen (true) and a better marksman (assuredly not true.)  The best shot on either side (and the least likeable personality) was probably Renee Fonck.  </p>
<p>My own favorite is James McCudden.  He fought without hate, and once wrote home about an enemy airplane he downed in flames, &#8220;By God, there was a man in there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jews as a group *may* have a complaint against us gentiles.  On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t recall mistreating one.  Their complaint is against the Nazis, and American gentiles fought agsinst the Nazis, being the main instrument of the defeat of the Third Reich.  The Holocaust?  One of my great uncles was killed at the Battle of the Bulge in t6he US army.  Even Russia could not have stood alone against Hitler.</p>
<p>Could the US have done more?  I don&rsquo;t see how, except by defeating the Nazi regieme, which we did.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;I was doing a search of a small country in West African, and it mentioned there, in that country around 1994, was the first time a head of state in Africa peacefully stepped down from office after an election.&#8221;</p>
<p>   Are you talking about Jerry Rawlings of Ghana. He is half Scottish from his father&rsquo;s side. He was the best leader in Ghana&rsquo;s post independence history and single handed reduced corruption and turned the economy around. A similar case is that of Jean Ping of Ghana one of the most competent politician in Africa. He is half Chinese from his father&rsquo;s side. Thus the best black leaders are the ones with European or Asian blood.</p>
