<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But the Rev. Jeremiah Wright is retiring in luxury  &mdash;  with all the trappings of the white &#8220;middleclassness&#8221; he warns his flock to avoid.</p>
<p>Wright is forsaking South Side Chicago and the black ghetto for a gated golf club community in Tinley Park, an affluent suburb. The area has seen a boom in growth from mostly non-Hispanic whites buying upscale homes in new subdivisions like Wright&rsquo;s adopted Odyssey Club neighborhood, which boasts some of Tinley Park&rsquo;s largest homes and a mix of townhomes. It adjoins the Odyssey Country Club and golf course.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with that; it&rsquo;s the American dream. Except that Wright has condemned that dream (along with America) in sermons he&rsquo;s delivered to the 8,000 mostly black congregants of Trinity United Church of Christ. He says it&rsquo;s all part of a white conspiracy to get blacks hooked on middle-class materialism and separate them from the inner-city and their African roots.</p>
<p>He also preaches the gospel of &#8220;Black Liberation Theology,&#8221; a false Christian doctrine promulgated by Marxist-leaning black writers of the 1960s that espouses &#8220;economic parity&#8221; and other collectivist claptrap.</p>
<p>The concept of practicing what you preach is apparently lost on Wright.</p>
<p>After decades of lecturing blacks to remain loyal to the black ghetto and eschew the white suburbs, he&rsquo;s now building a 10,340-square-foot mansion in the white suburbs. Among its amenities: an elevator, a rubberized exercise room and room for a future theater and indoor swimming pool.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps this is &#8220;sharing in the prosperity,&#8221; as Obama has so eloquently rephrased redistribution of income. Funny how those who demand economic parity end up taking the biggest share.<br>

					<p>Always remember these basic rules and yo will do fine:</p>
<p>1. &#8220;Integration&#8221; is Good.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Integration&#8221; means black people escaping black ghetto trash by moving into predominately white neighborhoods.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;White Flight&#8221; is Bad. </p>
<p>&#8220;White flight&#8221; means white folks escaping the same black ghetto trash by moving into predominately white neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Rev. Wright is Good since he is &#8220;integrating&#8221; Tinley Park.  </p>
<p>You, on the other hand (assuming you could afford to move there) are evil because you are &#8220;white flighting&#8221; from the same criminal black folk that Rev. Wright is escaping.</p>
<p>On the other hand, given that he is high yellow from way back, Rev. Wright may be an evil white flighter, too. He is just passing after all.</p>

					<p> This preening, octoroon fraud, who appears to have even less black heritage than Obama, is yet another demonstration of one of the oldest truisms in the world: Hypocrisy pays. Having spent many years screaming his message of racial hatred to ignorant blacks who swallowed it whole like watermelon, he is now retiring with the handsome spoils of his &#8220;ministry&#8221; to bask in luxury among those &#8220;white folks&#8221; he so despised.</p>
<p> If Wright loves his &#8220;black bruthuhs and sistuhs&#8221; so much, why didn&rsquo;t he buy a lot in an upscale black neighborhood in the suburbs   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m sure there are a number of them in Chicago now, due partly to affirmative action and partly to the fact that these blacks are lucky enough to have had ancestors who were brought to the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>as slaves, instead of, say, Brazil or Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p> He probably was afraid such a neighborhood wouldn&rsquo;t be safe enough for him and his family. Gang bangers, you know. He loved having them in the pews, shouting &#8220;That&rsquo;s right, bruthuh!&#8221; and the like, but, let&rsquo;s face it, would you really want to live next to one?</p>

10,000+ square feet of haute-bourgeois luxury, including an elevator, a rubberized (?) exercise room and an indoor pool. Wright for him   &mdash;   but <span class="caps">WRONG </span>for you, Casper! </p>
<p>&#8220;Disavowal of middle-classness&#8221;? This uppity octoroon has done skipped middle-classness and gone straight to <span class="caps">UPPER</span>-classness. What are those &#8220;8,000 mostly black congregants&#8221; dropping in Da Rev&rsquo;s collection plate, anyhow? Fitties? Franklins? G-notes? </p>
<p>But I must say I&rsquo;m impressed with the angry, sarcastic tone of the article, considering it&rsquo;s from Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily. It sounds more like some white-solidarity website   &mdash;   and I mean that in the most flattering way. <br>

					<p>One would think that, in a sane world, the black congregation would look down on its pastor for wanting to move into a white neighborhood, and it would. However, in the current world, the goal of all blacks is to move into a white neighborhood, or at least a better neighborhood (in other words, white or formerly white). So naturally, the congregation simply sees this as a sign that its &#8220;chosen son&#8221; has made good in the world, something they all want to do themselves eventually. Unfortunately, over time, the neighborhood they move into loses the traits that made it desirable in the first place, and the process has to start all over again. I&rsquo;ve seen it happen before, and I continue to see it happen in my own area.</p>

					<p>I am sure the rich White liberal leftists that live there will welcome him with open arms. Probably even have a block barbecue with ribs and all the trimmings for him and his friends&hellip;..More black hypocricy. He made a fortune off his hate for the White man and that same White man will welcome him into his community.  A pox on both their houses!</p>

					<p>You mean the ol&rsquo; shuck and jive worked? Of course this is what he did. It&rsquo;s what every black pastor I ever worked with did. They tell the congregations that they will not be blessed unless they bless the &#8220;man of God&#8221; first. Then they buy a Lexus and have a guest speaker come in (a professional fleecer who goes from one church to another). These guest speakers brag about their big houses and redeliver the pastors message, taking more money from the congregation. Black pastors keep black people down, not me. </p>
<p>I wonder if his neighbors will now move. If they are liberals they will have him over for dinner and apologize for how the white man created a society in which he can live free from the fear of his own congregation.</p>

					<p>Yeah, the article forgets to mention that Wight purchased his new home with a <span class="caps">HIGHLY </span>dubious 10 million dollar loan taken out in his church&rsquo;s name.  Don&rsquo;t be surprised if, in the near future, you see Wright on the steps of his home, being lead off in handcuffs.  </p>

<p>The Obamas and the Wrights want to see blacks prosper more because it embarasses them to be a part of a race of failures who rightly have a reputation for being dimwitted with almost zero ability, so they rant and rave about racism, slavery and inequality hoping to intimidate whitey into giving blacks even more than what they get right now, to sort of upgrade the group.</p>

					<p>The interesting thing here is not Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s hypocrisy but the fact that he clearly made a fortune as a preacher in a tax exempt church.  (I certainly couldn&rsquo;t afford to move into his new neighborhood.)  These black &#8220;reverends&#8221; always do very well for themselves.<br>

<p>And where will all the dough to pay for racist Wright&rsquo;s new digs come from?  It&rsquo;ll come from all the dollars and cents his hate preaching convinced his poor and middle class minions to give to the church. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for his so-called followers, but shouldn&rsquo;t they feel hoodwinked now that he&rsquo;s out in safe, White Tinley Park and they&rsquo;re still stuck back in one of the worst areas of Chicago?  </p>

					<p>Jeremiah is living the dreams that many televangelists also live so I can&rsquo;t blame him for his hypocrisy.  However, what I&rsquo;m <span class="caps">ALWAYS </span>going to be suspicious of is the fact that Hussein Obama is even more of a phone hypocrite than is Jeremiah.  Let&rsquo;s face it, this guy has been tied to anti-white groups and causes and apparently is headed toward being our next President.  This creep gives me chills.</p>

					<p>This mostly white &#8220;black&#8221; hatemonger has spent years amassing a fortune selling hatred of whites (which always sells in the black community) and extolling the black community, but then he retires in wealth and luxury as far as he can get from those blacks he praises, and, just to make sure those blacks <span class="caps">KEEP OUT, </span>he lives in a <span class="caps">GATED </span>lily white neighborhood at that.<br>
If those whites are so evil and dedicated to harming blacks, why would he want to live amid them? Apparently he feels more comfortable and trusting of whites than he does blacks. Like Obama, he is a big phony. His snake oil was selling hatred of whites just like Nazis did selling hatred of Jews. He made his fortune at <span class="caps">OUR </span>expense: Then has the <span class="caps">GALL </span>to live among us.</p>
<p>And this just in on the black pathology news front: A black Nigerian national serving in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>military (why?) stationed in Japan just stabbed to death a Japanese taxi driver. This just after another black <span class="caps">U.S. </span>serviceman was arrested for the rape of a 14 year old Japanese girl. And that just after another Japanese woman named a group of black <span class="caps">U.S. </span>servicemen in her gang rape. Violent crime after violent crime, in a country where violent crime is nearly non-existent, and consistently it is blacks brought into Japan by the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>who are the perpetrators. Remember the horrific kidnapping and rape of that 12 year old Japanese schoolgirl by 3 black <span class="caps">U.S. </span>servicemen? Even when blacks are only a tiny proportion of the population, they will be responsible for a wild disproportion of violent crime in places where such violence was almost unheard of before their arrival.<br>

					<p>Unbelievable. First of all I want to thank <span class="caps">AMREN </span>for all that you do. I love reading the posts and articles. Keep up the great work.</p>
<p>It has been a while since I have posted anything, but wanted to bring up a point that I think has been missed in the biased mainstream media. Obviously, the libs and Obama are tring desperatly to downplay the actions of this preacher. Question, wasn&rsquo;t it not to long ago that Don Imus was literally crucified in the press for calling the Rutgers girls nappy-headed hoes? Now, I really see nothing racist in his remark at all. He simply made an observation, or at worst expressed an opinion. I can certainly agree that they are a bunch of hood rats, who&rsquo;s only talent is playing street ball, wow. I&rsquo;m impressed.</p>
<p>Anyway, this just goes to show yet annother example of America&rsquo;s double standard towards race in an effort to lift an otherwise useless race up out of it&rsquo;s own gutters. See, I feel that if he wants to try and promote his race and assist with their opportunities&hellip;. fine! I mean really, it does not bother me. Someone needs to call them out and instill some values. Bill Cosby tried to shed light on the subject and the critics tore him apart as well. </p>
<p>Where I have the serious problem is when whites attempt to do the same thing. I consider myself very pro-white. I live in town that is 98% white, and I could leave my keys in my brand new truck in town square and come back out of a store a few hours later with no reservations or risks. My kids are safe, life is good to make a long story short. But you see, my pro-white beliefs would surely be misconstrued in the PC world of course. If I went to a &#8220;White&#8221; church that spoke in the same manner as this &#8220;Holy man&#8221;, my goodness, you would think that I was a grand wizzard myself. I just get so sick of the constant pandering to this group. If I want to build up and support my race, then that is my God given right. If they want to do the same, fine. But don&rsquo;t make me out to be the bad guy for having the same goals as you, for wanting my kids to go to college, and prefering the company of folks of similar thought. </p>
<p>Sorry so long folks, thanks for your time.</p>

					<p>Not surprising at all.  All people with money move to white neighborhoods.  This is nothing new.  I know plenty of white hypocrites who live in all lily white neighborhoods who also call me a racist.  This may be nothing new to us who are aware, but just remember that the mainstream media and people in academia will exaggerate and say that we are the racists while they run away to white neighborhoods.  The trick is to call them on it and inform others who are not racially aware.  We have a job to do.</p>

The black ghetto is already conquered territory. They need to move to white areas to conquer more territory. It is <span class="caps">ALL </span>about the conquest, domination and emasculation of the white man. For this, his black congregation will give him anything he wants.

<p>You hate that which you depend on.  Most hate their bosses.  Most hate their jobs.  Most teenagers resent their parents, yet their parents are the ones who put food in their stomach, buy them cell phones, fancy clothes, nice cars, etc&hellip;</p>

Jeremiah Wright is retiring in luxury  &mdash;  with all the trappings of the white &ldquo;middleclassness&rdquo; he warns his flock to avoid&hellip;Wright is forsaking South Side Chicago and the black ghetto for a gated golf club community in Tinley Park, an affluent suburb. The area has seen a boom in growth from mostly non-Hispanic whites buying upscale homes in new subdivisions like Wright&rsquo;s adopted Odyssey Club neighborhood, which boasts some of Tinley Park&rsquo;s largest homes and a mix of townhomes. It adjoins the Odyssey Country Club and golf course&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course all those <span class="caps">WHITES </span>who live there are those <span class="caps">GREEDY WHITE MEN </span>who keep <span class="caps">BLACKS </span>poor and downtrodden&hellip;yet, <span class="caps">HE, </span>isn&rsquo;t &#8220;GREEDY&#8221;&hellip;because, as we all know&hellip;ONLY whites are corrupt, racist and greedy!&hellip;he, being a <span class="caps">BLACK </span>man, is living the <span class="caps">AMERICAN </span>dream!&hellip;HE&rsquo;S getting <span class="caps">HIS </span>share of the pie&hellip;but, <span class="caps">GREEDY</span>?&hellip;oh no&hellip;NOT him!</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with that; it&rsquo;s the American dream. Except that Wright has condemned that dream (along with America) in sermons he&rsquo;s delivered to the 8,000 mostly black congregants of Trinity United Church of Christ. He says it&rsquo;s all part of a white conspiracy to get blacks hooked on middle-class materialism and separate them from the inner-city and their African roots&hellip;</p>
<p>Funny how this &#8220;retiree&#8221; has jumped from <span class="caps">PO&rsquo;&hellip;</span>living in the ghetto into a <span class="caps">RICH </span>retiree&hellip;completely bypassing <span class="caps">MIDDLECLASSNESS</span>!&hellip;</p>
<p>He also preaches the gospel of &ldquo;Black Liberation Theology,&rdquo; a false Christian doctrine promulgated by Marxist-leaning black writers of the 1960s that espouses &ldquo;economic parity&rdquo; and other collectivist claptrap&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;economic parity&#8221;?&hellip;with who?&hellip;Donald Trump?&hellip;the neigborhood he&rsquo;s moving into is one that the common working average person could <span class="caps">NOT </span>afford!&hellip;</p>
<p>After decades of lecturing blacks to remain loyal to the black ghetto and eschew the white suburbs, he&rsquo;s now building a 10,340-square-foot mansion in the white suburbs. Among its amenities: an elevator, a rubberized exercise room and room for a future theater and indoor swimming pool&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a &#8220;preacher&#8221; in a <span class="caps">BLACK INNERCITY CHURCH </span>with <span class="caps">POOR BLACKS </span>as his flock and he can afford a mansion?&hellip;I truly have to wonder how <span class="caps">DOWNTRODDEN </span>and <span class="caps">PO&rsquo; </span>those people are?!&hellip;wouldn&rsquo;t his <span class="caps">FLOCK </span>benefit more if the funds used to build the mansion were given to his flock?&hellip;or is it only <span class="caps">WHITES </span>who are expected to redistribute <span class="caps">THEIR </span>wealth?&hellip;and, along with this mansion he has a $10,000,000 &#8220;letter of credit&#8221;!&hellip;a <span class="caps">PREACHER</span>?&hellip;has anyone investigated his &#8220;church&#8221;?&hellip;they are the ones who are financing this mansion and the letter of credit!&hellip;is <span class="caps">THIS </span>why they are given tax-exempt status?&hellip;to make the preacher <span class="caps">RICH</span>?&hellip;has anyone investigated Wright&rsquo;s income tax returns and the financial records of the church?&hellip;if not&hellip;why not?&hellip;Obama&rsquo;s real estate deal should also be investigated too!</p>
<p>Perhaps this is &ldquo;sharing in the prosperity,&rdquo; as Obama has so eloquently rephrased redistribution of income. Funny how those who demand economic parity end up taking the biggest share&hellip;</p>
<p>Funny how those who want &#8220;equality&#8221; and &#8220;parity&#8221; actually feel they are <span class="caps">ENTITLED </span>to have <span class="caps">MORE </span>&#8220;equality&#8221; and <span class="caps">MORE </span>&#8220;parity&#8221;&hellip;which is <span class="caps">NOT </span>&#8220;equality&#8221; or &#8220;parity&#8221; at all!&hellip;</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">RACE GAME </span>and the use of the <span class="caps">RACE CARD </span>is a <span class="caps">SCAM</span>!&hellip;the purveyors of this are <span class="caps">SCAM ARTISTS </span>making an <span class="caps">EXTREMELY </span>good living off the backs of their ancestors and &#8220;people&#8221;!&hellip;these people &#8220;PLAY&#8221; their own people <span class="caps">MORE </span>than any <span class="caps">WHITE </span>has!&hellip;they <span class="caps">USE </span>their own people <span class="caps">MORE </span>than any <span class="caps">WHITE </span>has!&hellip;they <span class="caps">KEEP </span>their people down, to benefit <span class="caps">THEMSELVES, MORE </span>than any <span class="caps">WHITE </span>has!&hellip;RACISM and <span class="caps">CLASSISM </span>of <span class="caps">WHITES </span>toward <span class="caps">BLACKS</span>?&hellip;how about <span class="caps">RACISM </span>and <span class="caps">CLASSISM </span>of <span class="caps">CERTAIN BLACK </span>race hustlers towards <span class="caps">BLACKS</span>?</p>

					<p>&#8220;Remember the horrific kidnapping and rape of a 12 year-old Japanese girl by three black US servicemen&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>One of those perpetrators raped and murdered a white woman back here in the United States after serving his sentence in a Japanese prison.</p>
<p>The US has forces stationed in Iceland, but they are not allowed off-base after dusk.</p>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s first crush was on a pair of Finnish twins at her junior high school, so she might safely be accused of having &#8220;white fever&#8221;, but the loathing she and most other Japanese have for niguro - kokujin if you prefer - really must be witnessed firsthand.</p>
<p>She thinks they hate anyone who is civilized, out of envy, and that it has nothing whatever to do with slavery.  Reverend Wright&rsquo;s move to a high-end white neighborhood confirms this to both of us.  Their simultaneous hate and envy is really quite remarkable.</p>
<p>I tried getting her to post here a few times, as she has an interesting perspective on race in America, being married to a grey-eyed devil/cracker/neo-Copperhead.  Either her written English wasn&rsquo;t good enough, or her messages too vitriolic, so they didn&rsquo;t pass muster.</p>
<p>There <strong>are</strong> decent blacks out there.  One of them was in the WW-2 battle reenactment society I used to belong to.  He owned a hobby store, of all things.  Another, I knew in college.  Still another is a neighbor, who likes the same movies I do.  His wife was the crazy one, and this left their daughter somewhat unhinged.  Yet another neighbor is black; he&rsquo;s a college student, and gay, with a white boyfriend (?)  They are just ordinary people.  One can&rsquo;t hate people like them.  What would be the point?  I&rsquo;m the ex-con in the neighborhood, after all.  The retired <span class="caps">CIA </span>agent across the street is now my friend, but his first three words to me were &#8220;You f*****g felon.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no white &#8220;plot&#8221; to ruin the lives of blacks; whatever the Reverend Wrights of the world would like to believe, just as there was no US plot to provoke a war with Japan in 1941.  My wife cried when I had her read about it.  The oil and scrap metal embargo that precipitated the Pearl Harbor attack was accompanied by US insistance that Japan withdraw from China.  They thought this included Manchuria.  It did not, and the Pacific War was thus fought by mistake.  The US also wanted an end to European colonialism in Asia.  We had already promised the Philippines their independence before the war, and Britain promised India it&rsquo;s independence with some urging on our part.</p>
<p>No hominid subspecies has been as vilified for doing good as European whites.  We&rsquo;ve had our bad moments, like when we imported Reverend Wright&rsquo;s ancestors, the Inquisition, the nazis, the communists, and the sort of fusion of all four we call &#8220;political correctness&#8221;, but on the whole, we&rsquo;ve done rather well.  </p>
<p>The Reverend Wrights of the world are hypocrites.  Should we accept them as co-nationals and fellow human beings when they spout such obscene hatred of us?  &#8220;God damn America&#8221;?</p>
<p>I am a healthy 13/16 white 3/16 Amerind male who lives in Colorado.  I have 79 US and foreign patents awarded and over three dozen articles published in peer-reviewed journals.  I turn 42 in a week, but I look about 25.  I could find work in my old field if I left the <span class="caps">US. </span> I could have my old gun collection shipped to me if I moved to the right country.  I have a wonderful wife and a little girl, who would come with me wherever I go.  While I strongly suspect the US is not ready for a convicted felon as President, and I am certainn it is not ready for a Japanese First Lady, there is so much else that makes being an American great. </p>
<p>&#8220;God damn America&#8221;, Reverend Wright?  I am a federal felon on the Terrorist Watch List, who will never have a chance at shooting my rifles again, let alone living in a gated golf-course neighborhood (are there rifle-range neighborhoods?  I mean, outside of Iraq, the Sudan and Afghanistan?)  </p>
<p>I love America, and I spent 14 months in Australia far more homesick than I was during three years in prison.</p>

					<p>My coworker is a member of Wright&rsquo;s church and she lives in a white suburb as well. On a few occasions, I have overheard her making anti-white slurs to her black co-workers. Why do they hate us but they want to be everywhere we are?</p>

<p>The best I can figure, is that most of the unsuccessful peoples of the earth, and not just blacks, seem to have the mindset that like nice neighborhoods, good schools, thriving economies etc. are natural features of the earth similar to mountains, rivers or forests, and not the product of human efforts.</p>
<p>For example, take the case of Zimbabwe, it is said that the whites stole all the &#8220;productive&#8221; farmland, hence the need for land seizures.  In fact the Whites took the wastelands, made them productive, and when the whites were forced out these &#8220;productive lands&#8221; returned to the wasteland. The blacks probably did genuinely believe, that they could simply kill the white farmers, put their feet up and reap the windfall profits that would surely roll in, not realizing the hard work and planning that went into industrial farming.</p>
<p>Likewise with immigrants or internal subnational entities, like African Americans, these people seem to have a mindset that the features of white communities such as non crime ridden neighborhoods, white collar jobs, good schools are natural resources no different than fresh water or timber which the whites are greedily hoarding from them and not in any way connected to the character of the people in those neighborhoods.</p>
<p>When people like Wright move into lilly white neighborhoods, it isn&rsquo;t to be around white people but to claim their fair share of the good things in life which whites have been keeping from them. Like the black farmers in Zimbabwe they probably genuinely believe that these &#8220;nice&#8221; neighborhoods will remain so even if the people that made them nice are driven out and displaced.<br>

					<p>I was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago. Obama was my neighborhood&rsquo;s Illinois State Representative just a short 6 years ago, before he was pushed up to become US Senator now pushed to be our President. Obama&rsquo;s children go to my former private school - mostly White, Jewish, mixed race, very few Black Blacks though the surrounding neighborhoods are 95% Black Black.</p>
<p>I have noted these facts about mixed race and very light skinned Blacks like Barack Obama and Jeremiah Wright. </p>
<p>The basic rule is that mixed race men who want to pass for Black, go with the Black thing are the most anti White, chip on their shoulder types. They have to constantly insult, challenge White men, they go for sexual conquests of as many White women as they can, but choose to marry Black women and support far away hate White Black causes like Mugabe in Zimbabwe, <span class="caps">ANC </span>etc. </p>
<p>Very, very few mixed race women have this problem, most don&rsquo;t hate White people. Mixed race women, lighter skinned Black women tend to know the score, know how extremely destructive Black, Black men are and they are generally reasonable people. It&rsquo;s the Black, Black women and lighter, mixed race men that are the folks who are obsessed with hating WHite people. The Obama husband and wife team - mixed race male, Black, Black woman are hate White people team.</p>
<p>The former <span class="caps">NBC</span> Today Show Host Bryan Gumble is another light skinned &#8220;Black&#8221; who follows the Barack, Rev. Wright mold. Brian Gumble had/has a huge racial chip on his shoulder, always goes for anti White stances, yet he sexually harassed, went for White women.</p>

<p><strong>Why am I mot surprised he is both a hypocrite and a phony? Looks like he is embracing the Devil afterall, since he can&rsquo;t wait to move into a community made up of people he calls devils. He could always buy a nice stretch of property in a Black community, and build a beautiful large house on it. But then, he knows his home would be a risk for break-in robberies, and by guess who? Deep down, even he knows who the real devils are in society!</strong></p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m confident the &#8220;93.2 percent White&#8221; demographic includes numerous White Liberals who fancy themselves Black. </p>
<p>Rest assured, many Whites in Minister Wright&rsquo;s new neighborhood are the same ones who&rsquo;ve been apologizing for Minister Wright and Minister Farrakhan since their inception of their ministries, and they&rsquo;ll be casting their votes for Barack Hussein Obama and a &#8220;better, Blacker&#8221; America.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Funny how those who want &ldquo;equality&rdquo; and &ldquo;parity&rdquo; actually feel they are <span class="caps">ENTITLED </span>to have <span class="caps">MORE </span>&ldquo;equality&rdquo; and <span class="caps">MORE </span>&ldquo;parity&rdquo;&hellip;which is <span class="caps">NOT </span>&ldquo;equality&rdquo; or &ldquo;parity&rdquo; at all!&hellip;&#8221;<br>
Posted by Suzan Donoghue at 1:04 PM on April 4 </p>
<p><br>
Excellent points, Susan.</p>
<p>Regarding parity, I think the black leadership is caught up in pushing for it, because they have some delusion that economic status will somehow elevate blacks to the equal of whites in every respect, considering that they believe that whites succeed only because they &#8220;know&#8221; someone who gets them a well-paying job, or they advance via some crooked means.</p>
<p>They believe that once blacks have economic parity they will whistle along doing what whitey has been doing all these years, and things will be fine.  It is their naivete, and lack of intellect that allows them to dupe themselves into believing such nonsense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m positive they believe that every black is a potential Barack Hussein, but can&rsquo;t realize their full potential because of whites.  </p>
<p>A huge black economic powerhouse, in no time, would resort to the mean and amount to nothing more than more of the same black failure. </p>
<p>There will <span class="caps">NEVER </span>be peace in any society that has primitive blacks to deal with.  <span class="caps">NEVER.</span> And their presence will <span class="caps">ALWAYS </span>constantly drag down the other races around them.</p>

					<p>That&rsquo;s right Brothas and Sistas! Reach into your pockets and purses, and give money to the church. Don&rsquo;t aspire to the white mans evil way of money and materialsim. I will continue to prech against the evil, wicked, white man until I have collected enough to retire and live comfortably among them.</p>

					<p>JR: </p>
<p>My theory about that, the reason why mulatto men are the most strident &#8220;diversity&#8221; enthusiasts is that, they know their white half makes them smart and presentable, but the one drop philosophy means they&rsquo;ll never be white.  Since they can&rsquo;t be white, they don&rsquo;t want anyone else to be white.</p>
<p>And I slightly disagree about this axiom not applying to mulatto women   &mdash;   there was a local talk radio host in St. Louis named Lizz Brown.</p>

					<p>Being in an affluent suburb cant keep them away. This is the same Tinley Park that saw some corn-rolled black come in and kill 5 women in a clothing store a couple months ago.<br>
Naperville, another big affluent suburb, just had a murder with 5 men currently facing charges. Naperville is probably 95% white. the 5 chargees were all black and of course from other towns.</p>
