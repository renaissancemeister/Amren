<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>
							As far as I can deduce, beneath the suffocating silences of the state bureaucracy &mdash; now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Labor Party &mdash; last Monday a group of violent racists acted out their YouTube fantasies and stormed into Merrylands High School at 8.50am, armed with machetes and baseball bats. They then started to beat the crap out of people.
						</p>
						<p>
							A week after this rampage, any member of the public interested in this crime could have deduced the alleged perpetrators were Tongan morons. Or perhaps morons who are, regrettably, Australian citizens but portray themselves as &#8220;nigga gangstas&#8221;. The reaction of the various state agencies to this crime was best described in a Herald editorial last week as &#8220;a torrent of the most extraordinary obfuscation, and a reluctance to acknowledge the reality that local residents live with every day&#8221;.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just as Goulburn jail, home to the most violent offenders, is dominated by Aborigines, Pacific Islanders and Lebanese Muslims, so is racial hate-mongering in our society disproportionately represented by these same groups, even as the ideologically tainted human rights industry obsesses about white racism.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the internet you can find hundreds of video clips featuring variations on the Tongan-moron theme, glorifying crime and racial violence. Here&rsquo;s a smattering of lyrics from a rap song on YouTube: &#8220;I want your head boy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Two niggers in the front, two niggers in the back .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My homies .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. brains over the sidewalk &hellip;&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							Out in the real world &mdash; the one not controlled by the ideologically driven, politically captured spin machine of the NSW Government &mdash; what the people who live with the glorious ethnic melting pot of western Sydney have to say is closer to the gritty truth than anything the Government or police is telling us.
						</p>
						<p>
							Take, for example, some of the responses on the internet to one video from a group of self-styled Tongan gangstas, known as Gee-40, a group allegedly affiliated with the five teenagers charged in the rampage at Merrylands High:
						</p>
						<p>
							&mdash; &#8221;Tongans showing their class.&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							&mdash; &#8221;You&rsquo;re not in America. Get a life.&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							&mdash; &#8221;A f&mdash;ing disgrace to Polynesians all over. I&rsquo;m embarrassed to even be culturally associated with you wannabes.&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							&mdash; &#8221;Get the f&mdash; out of Sydney, coconuts.&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							&mdash; &#8221;Sad flops, coconuts.&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							&mdash; &#8221;F &mdash; u faggots ain&rsquo;t shit lil boys talkn rubbish u betta hope u&rsquo;s dont get lokd up juvi or big boys ma uso&rsquo;s gona f&mdash; u&rsquo;s up&#8221; (Threat posted by samoan2170).
						</p>
						<p>
							&mdash; &#8221;I have more respect for the lebanese community than u f&mdash;s. The majority of FOBS are wannabe niggas acting it up. Face it you people are just imitators, get a life UR NOT BLACK!&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							You could waste a life reading this stuff; there&rsquo;s so much of it posted on the internet. Every so often, this simmering melting pot boils over, as it did last Monday.
						</p>
						<p>
							The most notorious example took place on December 12, 2005, when hundreds of violent, racist Lebanese Muslim men, many of whom had been sexually harassing young women at Sydney beaches for years, swept in convoys to the eastern beach suburbs for revenge raids in response to the anti-Lebanese demonstration and fracas at Cronulla the day before. The revenge attacks made the police response look reactive and inert, and were followed by meaningless tough talk by the Premier, Morris Iemma, the member for Lakemba, the area where the convoys of armed men had gathered.
						</p>
						<p>
							I know many police feel disconnected, even fatalistic, about the back-up they get from the justice system. This is why so many moonlight at other jobs, because their dreams of fighting crime seem naive.
						</p>
						<p>
							Typically, one of the five Tongan morons charged with invading Merrylands High School last week had been released just the previous week after being charged with armed robbery. He was deemed no threat to the community, although the proudly self-incriminating antics of Gee-40 on YouTube suggested otherwise.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was the latest example of a justice system that insults common sense on a routine basis when it comes to dealing with violent young offenders.
						</p>
						<p>
							The day after the rampage another insult was delivered by Justice Elizabeth Fullerton, who directed a jury that none of a different group of five offenders could be found guilty of murder even though they had gone to the White Horse Hotel in St Peters, three of them masked and armed with a shotgun, meat cleaver and a knife. In an ensuing melee, a bar patron, Stojce Petreski, died from a stab-wound to the heart.
						</p>
						<p>
							Justice Fullerton obviously felt compelled by the laws of evidence, and no doubt had an eye towards the appeals court, when she ruled that the jury could not find a direct causal link between the group going to a hotel to commit armed robbery and the death of Petreski. She went out of her way to insult the parents of the dead man when she said his death could have been an accident.
						</p>
						<p>
							The idea that you live with the consequences of your actions seems alien to the pedantic morality of the courts. Instead, the five could only be charged with armed robbery. To compound the insult, the criminal recklessness that led to the pointless death of a 33-year-old man remains coddled in anonymity. Those charged can only be known by their initials &mdash; SL (the ring-leader), RT, WS, II and ST &mdash; because two were under 18 at the time of the crime. Petreski&rsquo;s mother expressed disgust with Justice Fullerton&rsquo;s findings, saying the five would be back on the street in a few years. She&rsquo;s right.
						</p>
						<p>
							By the way, the five charged with armed robbery are all Tongan, although we&rsquo;re not supposed to mention that either. Apparently, the community can&rsquo;t be trusted with the truth.<br />

							Australia took away the citizen&rsquo;s right to bear arms a few years ago and look at it now. It seems that citizens are basically being offered for consumption by the growing minority groups arriving there. At least in the state I live in I can carry and have the right to defend myself.

							Uh, uh! Most ordinary Australians were always against the wholesale importation of Third World immigrants into Australia.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, they were howled down as &#8216;racist&rsquo; etc. but of course they were right. And they are the ones who have had to suffer the consequences of importing primitives into Australia.
						</p>
						<p>
							The only people who refuse to admit it are government officials and the PC brigade, including most of the media and academia.

							The Lebanese are just as criminal in Canada. They are a criminal tribe.
						</p>
						<p>
							Their idea of relating to Western women is to use their easy access to Middle-Eastern drugs as a route to sex. Because of their patriarchal culture, the males are encouraged to prey on outsiders by their families and communities. Many end up in jail on charges related to drugs or sex assault.

							In the suburb that I live in there is nearly no crime, very little vandalism except for some graffiti occasionally that gets removed quickly and the vast majority of the people seem very happy and feel safe.<br />
							Did I mention that 99% of us are white.<br />

							<br />
							- Actually, sounds like America for as long as I can remember. The media has been and continues to spin liberal fantasies, among them, that blacks and hispanics aren&rsquo;t committing disproportionate levels of crime here. They often leave off race/picture of a criminal, at least when it is a black/hispanic criminal, yet will play many times over the race if it is a white. Virtually never are black crimes portrayed as hate crimes,and when they do occur, they are rarely given much press, yet white crimes against a minority (which are far less common), no matter how tenuous the link are portrayed as hate crimes. And how often are minorities given the spotlight, while whites are left out? Look at any show like &#8220;Today&#8221;- even though in reality, more doctors, lawyers, etc are white men, minorities are chosen as their &#8220;experts&#8221;. If it was truly a race-blind, equalitarian act, it would be more white men, like one would get by random selection. What they are intentionally trying to do is smear white reputation, while blacks and hispanics are given a polished up appearance. It is psychological warfare, and institutionalized racism.

							Hmmmmm it seems the more I read the news the more I realize that the government elites in the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have betrayed the wishes and interests of their populations. The question now is not if these political leaders, media elites and the &#8220;useful idiots&#8221; that keep them in power are traitors, because without a doubt they have betrayed all of our nations, but what can we &#8220;the people&#8221; do about it?

						</p>
						<p>

							You are right the only people who lost their guns here were the registered law abiding gun owners. The criminals here are still very well armed.<br />

							Australian gun ownership was strictly limited after a maniac shot up a restaurant in Port Arthur, Tasmania, killing about 20 people.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was living in Sydney shortly afterward, and remember the newspaper pictures of the guns that were turned in to be destroyed. One of them caught my eye - an Argentine navy FN-49 - super rare - in even better condition than mine.
						</p>
						<p>
							I had long wanted a single-shot Martini-Enfleid in .303&#8221;, and had hoped to find one in Australia, but I didn&rsquo;t even bother looking once the laws had changed.

							These third-world throwbacks know that their own people would never allow hostile and incompatible aliens to push them around in their own countries. Because Western nations roll over and play dead for these foreign interlopers instead of forcing them out, they have no respect for the people of the Western nations they infest and one can hardly blame them for feeling this way&hellip;

							One of the common definitions of a totalitarian state is when a government uses the actions of the criminal minority as the pretext to define the rights and privileges of the law-abiding majority. Why don&rsquo;t the Aussies introduce their politicians to a little thing we Americans call a necktie party and reclaim both their manhood and their liberty? Come on boys, you don&rsquo;t really believe you&rsquo;re going to live forever do you?
