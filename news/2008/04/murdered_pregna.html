						<p>When Laci Peterson became the symbol of maternal homicide in the mass media and in the law books (the Violence Against Unborn Children Act is also known as the Laci and Connor&rsquo;s Law), it put a white face on the horrendous crime of maternal homicide. In reality, that face is actually young, and often, black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Left behind in much of the media attention is a slew of similar cases involving black women.</p>
<p># On June 13, 2007 Dawna Denise Wright was at her job, managing the office of a San Diego neurologist. At 2 p.m., a man came to her office bearing a bouquet of roses. &#8220;Are these for me?&#8221; she reportedly said, surprised. The man took out a gun and shot her.</p>
<p>Her killer was her on-and-off boyfriend, Roger McDowell, who was also the father of her 8-year-old daughter. An hour later, he confessed to the police but plead not guilty to murder charges.</p>
<p>Wright was three months pregnant with McDowell&rsquo;s child.</p>
<p># On Sept. 8, 2007 in Louisa, Va., Irwin Fountain, 28, was found guilty of shooting his 18-year-old girlfriend, Shantay Latrice Wheeler, 18, to death and dumping her body. Fountain, who was married at the time of the murder, had given Wheeler money for an abortion and became infuriated when he discovered that she was 8 1‚ÅÑ2-months pregnant. Her body was found in a field five months later with multiple gunshot wounds.</p>
<p># On February 7, 2007, Adrian Estrada, a 23-year-old San Antonio youth pastor received the death penalty for choking and stabbing 17-year-old Stephanie Sanchez to death and leaving her to bleed to death on her kitchen floor. Prosecutors said he was angry because the teenager, who told him she had been in love with him, had become pregnant with his child.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the CDC, black women have a maternal homicide risk about seven times that of white women. Black women ages 25-29 are about 11 times more likely as white women in that age group to be murdered while pregnant or in the year after childbirth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Fast Fact</b></p>
<p>The CDC estimates that 4-8 percent of pregnant women in the U.S. are abused by an intimate partner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;An abused wife or girlfriend may be hesitant to call 911 for fear that he&rsquo;ll be treated violently or even killed by the police,&#8221; says Theryn Kigvamasud&rsquo;Vashti, co-director of Communities Against Rape and Abuse in Seattle.</p>
<p>Mandatory arrest laws used in some states require police to make an arrest during any domestic dispute call. And if the batterer presents the situation to make it look like the wife is the initiator of the violence, she could be the one arrested. If she has children, she may fear losing them to social services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Young Moms: A Means of Control</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The CDC estimates that 4-8 percent of pregnant women in the U.S. are abused by an intimate partner.</p>
<p>For men who want to be &#8220;in control&#8221; of a relationship, an unwanted pregnancy can lead to anger and violence.</p>
<p>Then there are abusers who use pregnancy as a means to control their girlfriends, to keep them in a vulnerable and dependent condition.</p>
<p>A recent, disturbing study of 61 poor teenaged Boston-area girls of various ethnic backgrounds in abusive relationships published in the journal Ambulatory Pediatrics revealed that 26 percent had reported that their partners were actively trying to get them pregnant against their will. The girls reported that their partners manipulated their birth control or told them that they wanted them to become pregnant.</p>

			<p>Since most of the violent criminals are blacks, that makes sense. This is another attempt by big media to make the perpetrators look like victims. They always leave out those little facts like over 90% of inter-racial crimes there is a black attacking someone else.</p>

			<p> &#8220;(the Violence Against Unborn Children Act is also known as the Laci and Connor&rsquo;s Law), it put a white face on the horrendous crime of maternal homicide. In reality, that face is actually young, and often, black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strange this dork never saw fit to highlight the immense amount of black on white crime, but instead wants everybody to know about blacks killing each other.</p>
<p>We know all about that, because it&rsquo;s something the MSM rats don&rsquo;t try to hide.  Black on white crime is the big secret, if it is secrets they want to reveal to the public.</p>
<p>Of course they won&rsquo;t, because black on white crime is an image contrary to the pursuit of their agenda.<br>

			<p>This article has left-wing bias and left-wing sentiment dripping from almost every paragraph. Even when writing about abuses of non-white men against their partners, the article manages to take a dig at &#8220;the police,&#8221; as if the threat of violence from them is the real underlying problem.<br>

			<p>The media&rsquo;s verbal gymnastics on this sort of thing are always hilarious, and Miz Goldwert is no exception:</p>
<p><i>Cases of maternal homicide involving minority women are underreported and underpublicized.</i></p>
<p>The implication being, of course, that whitey hides the truth of the matter because he wants to do harm to non-whites, when in fact the media hides the truth of the matter because non-white crime rates embarrass them and would give whites &#8220;the wrong impression&#8221; if reported fairly.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;An abused wife or girlfriend may be hesitant to call 911 for fear that he&rsquo;ll be treated violently or even killed by the police,&#8221; says Theryn Kigvamasud&rsquo;Vashti, co-director of Communities Against Rape and Abuse in Seattle.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting way of putting it.  I wonder if Miz Goldwert would report other delusions with the same straight-faced approach; you know, fears of the Easter Bunny, driving off the road to avoid Santa&rsquo;s sleigh, etc.  LOL.</p>

			<p>Laci Peterson started out as a missing person case that turned into a real, live murder mystery soap opera. The husband only became a suspect weeks into it. </p>
<p>Being white makes it of interest because the majority of this country can identify with a middle class young white mother. Of course there are more black pregnant women murdered because their boyfriends are almost exclusively black. Society are large does not identify with the black underclass or care what happens in the ghetto because they know it is a jungle populated by predators. It&rsquo;s tragic for the parties involved but the internal workings of alien populations are of no interest to me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that one of the mothers in this story is hispanic. Bobby Cutts&rsquo; girlfriend was white. It appears pregnant women carrying the child of a black man are most at risk to be murdered, regardless of the race of the woman.</p>

			<p>This coming Sunday my wife&rsquo;s cousin makes a trip to Florida to see her black husband who is in prison. He has tried to kill her twice and has not succeeded.  This last time he stole all her money and her car. He got caught and is now doing time.<br>
People has tried to talk sense into her but there is none.<br>
As a preacher, I will eventually be asked to do her funeral.<br>
I can only come up with one word, trash. <br>
You reap what you sow.<br>
As for all those who think Christianity has caused our society to be color blind (to not see color) my Bible tells me that there are differences.  I will bring up verses which might shock those who might not know the Bible well enough at some time in the future.</p>

			<p>The REASON more pregnant black women are killed then White ones is because most of them have BLACK males for their partners. It is the violence of black males that is the reason, not some nebulous White conspiracy.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The man took out a gun and shot her.<br>
Her killer was her on-and-off boyfriend, Roger McDowell, who was also the father of her 8-year-old daughter. &#8220;</p>
<p>Do Black criminals like this ever think of where they will be on Crime Day + 1? How much foresight does it take to see their personal situation will be far, FAR worst than before their nefarious acts?</p>

			<p>There are slews of WHITE girls murdered by their black ghetto &#8220;prizes&#8221;:<br>
https://www.kmbc.com/news/15131820/detail.html<br>
Another white girl (Olivia Jackson, and pregnant) murdered by her black boyfriend (Sedale Fox, the father of her unborn child), in Leavenworth KS. The black killer&rsquo;s myspace pays homage to his gansta&rsquo; idol Tupoc, and &#8220;Thug&rsquo;s Life&#8221;, with the slogan &#8220;Only the strong survive&#8221;. I guess the dopey white girl was really enamored with this. This follows the white girl in Tyler TX just murdered (and then cannibalized) by HER black boyfriend. And we all remember the white woman in Canton OH pregnant with her second illegitimate child of a black male, Bobby Cutts, who murdered her. How many other cases have we just not heard about. The media is normally very careful to never show the photo of the victim and the killer in the same news story. It would be very interesting to see a study on the percentage of white females whose boyfriends are black (8%???) compared to the percentage of MURDERED white females who were killed by BLACK boyfriends (50%???). What these ding-a-ling white girls who associate with black males are too stupid to realize is that not only do they face a wildly increased risk of AIDs and a host of other incurable STDs that are RAMPANT among black males, but they face a wildly increased risk of being murdered too.<br>

			<p>Black, pregnant women being slapped around by black men isn&rsquo;t news. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s so commonplace and so accepted as normal in black culture that nobody bats an eye. On the other hand, the O.J. Simpson and Bobby Cutts murder cases involved Caucasian women and so were news.</p>
<p>Putting it another way, Tina Turner was slapped around by Ike Turner for 20-plus years. The only news here is why she put up with it for so long. If she was slapped around by Bruce Springsteen for 20 years, then it would be newsworthy, BECAUSE OF THE INTERRACIAL ASPECT.</p>
<p>Shonyelle Africa being shot and killed by Willie Kasavubu in South-Central Los Angeles is not news. If Africa were shot and killed trying to rob a Hispanic-owned liquor store by Carlos Escobar, then it would be news. South-Central would also be in flames, I&rsquo;d say.</p>

			<p>One sad aspect of this is that teenage girls (and young women) will absolutely refuse to listen to you if you try to explain the dangers of dating black men.  If those girls/women are related to you, all that will happen if you try to give them the facts, is that they will consider you a racist and not take you seriously any more. It&rsquo;s so important to get it into their head at an EARLY AGE that high risk relationships are not worth pursuing.  At the same time it&rsquo;s vital to not demonize all blacks.  If you do make sweeping statements about blacks, what&rsquo;s going to happen is she&rsquo;ll meet a black who happens to seem very nice and articulate.  When she sees this, she&rsquo;ll assume everything you told her was lies.  For those of us with daughters, it&rsquo;s like walking a tightrope.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m suprised since the vast majority of black births are illegitimate and done for profit by the mother. The father is nothing more that a sperm donor with no ties with the mother of the bastard child. Blacks routinely murder each other anyway for one foolish reason or another. Most have little concept of consequence for their actions and don&rsquo;t make very good criminals because of this fact.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s the co-director of &#8216;Communities against Rape and Abuse&rsquo;?, and that&rsquo;s what she has to say? Sounds more like she&rsquo;s director of something called, &#8216;Coddling Criminals and Making Excuses for Them&rsquo;, to me. Otherwise known as ADL (another dumb &#8216;liberal&rsquo;). </p>

<p> In the East Coast cities, there are 20/20 clubs. The prerequisite is that a young man father 20 children by as many different women as possible by the age of 20. Of course the mothers cant&rsquo;t inform the authorities who the father is because then they will lose all social benefits.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve written on here several times about how racist and biased blacks are, and if we just took one point to give an example of that the best one would be their complete disregard for their country and their non-black countrymen, and a fixation on their race no matter where in the world that might be.  </p>
<p>Example:  Remember Natalee Hollaway?  Well, this is what the good reverend had to say about her, during an anti-white, pro-black rant that he called a sermon:</p>
<p>&#8220;Black women are being raped daily in Darfur, Sudan, in the Congo and in Sub-Saharan Africa. That doesn&rsquo;t make news,&#8221; Wright said in the August 2005 edition of Trumpet Magazine, a publication of his Trinity United Church of Christ. </p>
<p>But, &#8220;One 18-year-old white girl from Alabama gets drunk on a graduation trip to Aruba, goes off and &#8216;gives it up&rsquo; while in a foreign country, and that stays in the news for months!&#8221; he added. &#8220;Maybe I am missing something!&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes, you ARE missing something you hateful little dork.  Natalee Hollaway is a fellow countryman.  Those in Darfur, Sudan, Haiti, Congo, Zimbabwe, South Africa are not.  Get the picture, Old Boy?  Didn&rsquo;t realize you were advertising your black loyalties over all else when you said that, did you?</p>
<p>And those doing the raping in those black countries are those you refer to as your racial kin.  You see, like the Muslims in every country in the West, blacks reach across national boundries to form their kinship and loyalties.  The country they live in means nothing to them, other than a place to earn money and viciously criticize when they&rsquo;re too dumb to compete, blaming their pitiful inabilities on white racism and oppression.</p>
<p>And also like the Muslims, if religious or racial Jihad occurs in one Western country, their religious kin or their racial kin will be fighting right with them, helping them any way they can.  An enemy to one of them is an enemy to all.  Having Muslims and blacks in our countries is EXACTLY the same as having foreign armies stationed in our homelands that hate us.  There&rsquo;s no difference.  </p>
<p>Does anybody still think that these Reverend Wright types aren&rsquo;t inciting their minions to rebel against their country?  Be advised that this man has aligned himself and his church with Louis Farrakhan&rsquo;s Black Muslims in the US.  And that is only one step away from aligning with Jihadists everywhere.  All that is needed is a call to action.</p>
<p>Adhering strictly to their racial loyalties and religious loyalties in the event of conflict, has a name now by those in the military sector who study the changing face of warfare.  It&rsquo;s called Fourth Generation War.</p>
<p>This evil multicultural agenda has so altered Western societal structures a new form of warfare to contend with has been the unintended consequences by the radicals responsible for it.</p>
<p>Or is it &#8220;unintended?&#8221;</p>

<p>&gt; I&rsquo;m not so sure of that.  Here&rsquo;s why; I grew up in Sacramento County and in the late 1960s, early &rsquo;70s it was not that hard to find white women with black men.  In every case I knew anything about, the white women were beaten regularly.  It seemed to me that it was due to rage felt by black men towards whites in general and white women in particular, who were - even after submitting to the black man sexually, still just too &#8220;high and mighty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forty years later, many young white women are nothing but black women with white skin, so socially trained are they.</p>
