<p>The contemporary white church has largely accepted King as a religious hero. Yet some observers say there is one religious community that continues to shun King &mdash; the largest black churches.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosperity ministers preach that God rewards the faithful with wealth and spiritual power. Prosperity pastors such as Bishop T.D. Jakes have become the most popular preachers in the black church. They&rsquo;ve also become brands. They&rsquo;ve built megachurches and business empires with the prosperity message.</p>
<p>Black prophetic pastors rarely fill the pews like other pastors, though, because their message is so inflammatory, says Henry Wheeler, a church historian.Prophetic pastors like the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the former pastor for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama, often enrage people because they proclaim God&rsquo;s judgment on nations, he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The prosperity gospel started as a fringe doctrine in the black church. It was pioneered by &#8220;Rev. Ike,&#8221; a prosperity televangelist with a pompadour who boasted during his heyday in the 1970s that &#8220;my garages runneth over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan Walton, author of &#8220;Watch This! Televangelism and African American Religious Culture,&#8221; says that although people may have chuckled at Ike&rsquo;s flamboyance, his theology exerts more influence in the modern black church than King&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;King got the glory and the history books, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [Ike has] got the numbers,&#8221; said Walton, who is also an assistant professor of religious studies at the University of California, Riverside.</p>
<p>Black prosperity preachers say their message is not based on greed, though, but self-help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The debate between self-help and political activism is nothing new in the black community. Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois clashed over the issue at the beginning of the 20th century. Most black prophetic teachers teach self-help along with activism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>King wanted to use the convention [The National Baptist Convention] as an institutional base for the movement. But his tactics &mdash; civil disobedience, publicly confronting segregationists &mdash; were repudiated by convention leaders and the Rev. J.H. Jackson, the convention president, says Wheeler, the church historian.</p>
<p>&#8220;He thought that if blacks were good citizens, worked hard and did what was expected, our rights will come; we would prove out merit,&#8221; Wheeler said.</p>
<p>In 1961, King tried to orchestrate the election of a leader to replace Jackson. He and a group of black ministers attempted to vote Jackson out of office at the convention&rsquo;s annual meeting. It was a disaster.</p>
<p>According to Taylor Branch&rsquo;s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, &#8220;Parting the Waters: America in the King Years,&#8221; ministers exchanged blows. One lost three teeth. Another was killed when his skull was fractured. Riot police were called out to separate the warring pastors.</p>
<p>Jackson kicked King out of the convention and held onto power. The pastors who aligned themselves with King formed their own group, the Progressive National Baptist Convention. The schism remains today.</p>
<p>Wheeler says the black church&rsquo;s rejection of King wasn&rsquo;t confined to its leadership. Most people in the pews didn&rsquo;t want to get involved. The movement was driven primarily by younger people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A new generation of prophetic ministers in the black church is now trying to do what King once attempted: gain a voice in the establishment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A few prophetic pastors have even talked about taking another approach to raising their profile in the black church: television, says Lawrence Mamiya, a professor of religion at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them have talked about the need to get on television and try to counter the televangelists, but I don&rsquo;t know of any social justice preacher who has a broad television audience,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At least one young prophetic minister has found a prominent place in the public eye.</p>
<p>The Rev. Raphael Warnock, senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where King preached, says that prosperity preaching is not just a distortion of Jesus&rsquo; message but a betrayal of the black church&rsquo;s heritage. The black church was formed by slaves who saw Jesus&rsquo; message as a tool for social justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prophetic voice of the black church is the very reason for its being,&#8221; Warnock said. &#8220;The only reason that there&rsquo;s such a thing as the black church is because of the question of freedom, justice and equal access.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walton, [Jonathan Walton, author of &#8220;Watch This! Televangelism and African American Religious Culture,&#8221;] says contemporary black churchgoers have now embraced another mission: equal access to wealth. &#8220;It&rsquo;s the theological doctrine of American culture,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s voice may ring out in the history books, but it no longer rings out in the black pews. Walton says the battle between the prophetic and prosperity ministers in the black church is over for now.</p>
<p>The Rev. Ikes have won.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Says Walton,] &#8220;We like to identify with Dr. King in theory, though we emulate Rev. Ike in practice.&#8221;<br>

					<p>This fight was lost when the blacks went along with <span class="caps">WEB</span> DuBois and his crowd over the teachings of Booker T. Washington. There&rsquo;s no going back for the blacks. They had their chance and muffed it. Now they&rsquo;re done for.</p>

					<p>After witnessing what goes on at Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s church, and hearing other blacks explain that it is the norm among black churches, any other unfavorable revelations like those here are now accepted without surprise.  </p>

					<p>I think Obama is in for a nice surprise this election season.  There is no way he&rsquo;s getting elected.  Now that he&rsquo;s been outed as a racist, his support among whites will evaporate.</p>
<p>But what is going to utterly destroy him will be the evaporation of support among blacks.  Blacks support him because he is black.  But their are limits.  He&rsquo;s crossed waaaay over those limits.</p>

					<p>The race industry is very strong. They rake in millions of dollars by keeping Blacks down and blaming Whites for all their troubles.</p>

					<p>&#8220;THe black church was formed by slaves who saw <span class="caps">JESUS&rsquo; </span>message as a tool for social justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>They should study a little harder. <span class="caps">JESUS </span>told the slaves, to be obedient to their masters,and work hard, and do their best.He also told the slave owners, to treat their slaves well, and be kind to them. He never advocated their release. The deciples often refered to themselves, as the slaves, of the <span class="caps">LORD JESUS CHRIST.</span> Blacks think they have a monopoly on slavery,when in fact, the people of nearly every country,have been enslaved,at some time in history. </p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that no one ever mentions Rev. Jesse Petersen of <span class="caps">BOND. </span> He is truly helping Blacks out of victimization.  He is against the race-baiting of the Black leadership and loudly denounces the &#8220;racism&#8221; argument so many Blacks subscribe to as an excuse for their own failures. He also defends Whites and condemns the racism towards them. Rev. Petersen is often overlooked because his message isn&rsquo;t popular with most Blacks and he doesn&rsquo;t have a megachurch. But he is deserving of the attention nonetheless.</p>

					<p>Well of course, judging someone by the color of their skin instead of the content of their character is paying off handsomely for black race-hustlers.</p>

					<p> Since the days of slavery, preaching and undertaking have always been the professions of choice in the black community. Undertaking because, due to the high rate of black criminality, there is never a shortage of black deaths in the ghetto. Preaching, because its one of the few businesses you can enter into in which the only inventory you need is hot air!</p>

					<p>As a white man living in the south (and old enough to see him in the media while he was still alive), I have always been an admirer of Dr. King.  Despite all the negativity expressed about Dr. King (some documented), his message was intended not just for Blacks, but for <span class="caps">ALL </span>people.  Dr. King made some very important and necessary strides for change.  Yet, if exhumed, I would reasonably suspect that Dr. King would be found to have literally &#8220;rolled over in his grave&#8221;.  If he could see the current state of not only the United States but also of the world, I would think that Dr. King would be severely disappointed - if not heartbroken.</p>
