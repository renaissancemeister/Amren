						<p>Mecca is the direction all Muslims face when they perform their daily prayers.</p>
<p>The call was issued at a conference held in the Gulf state of Qatar under the title: Mecca, the Centre of the Earth, Theory and Practice.</p>
<p>One geologist argued that unlike other longitudes, Mecca&rsquo;s was in perfect alignment to magnetic north.</p>
<p>He said the English had imposed GMT on the rest of the world by force when Britain was a big colonial power, and it was about time that changed.</p>
<p><b>Mecca watch</b></p>
<p>A prominent cleric, Sheikh Youssef al-Qaradawy, said modern science had at last provided evidence that Mecca was the true centre of the Earth; proof, he said, of the greatness of the Muslim &ldquo;qibla&rdquo; &mdash; the Arabic word for the direction Muslims turn to when they pray.</p>
<p>The meeting also reviewed what has been described as a Mecca watch, the brainchild of a French Muslim.</p>
<p>The watch is said to rotate anti-clockwise and is supposed to help Muslims determine the direction of Mecca from any point on Earth.</p>
<p>The meeting in Qatar is part of a popular trend in some Muslim societies of seeking to find Koranic precedents for modern science.</p>
<p>It is called &ldquo;Ijaz al-Koran&rdquo;, which roughly translates as the &ldquo;miraculous nature of the holy text&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The underlying belief is that scientific truths were also revealed in the Muslim holy book, and it is the work of scholars to unearth and publicise the textual evidence.</p>
<p>But the movement is not without its critics, who say that the notion that modern science was revealed in the Koran confuses spiritual truth, which is constant, and empirical truth, which depends on the state of science at any given point in time.</p>

					<p>Give me a break! Non-Muslims can&rsquo;t even enter Mecca, for Pete&rsquo;s sake, so why would it form the centre of anything that non-Muslims even have to remotely consider? If Muslims wonder why they have such a negative reputation among Westerners, they should think about Mecca, about which non-Muslims don&rsquo;t give a darn.</p>

					<p>This is funny, as before the West invented modern clocks, Muslims had no concept of precise time.  <span class="caps">GMT </span>is convenient, in large part because the Greenwich Meridian happens to be opposite a convenient spot to put the International Date Line.</p>
<p>Nothing is stopping Muslim countries from using their own system of time.  If they go over to Mecca Mean Time, fine, But while they&rsquo;re at it, they should keep in mind that it would be irrelevant for the purpose of determining time zones.  The world would still be 24,000 miles around and would still take 24 hours to spin once on its axis, meaning each time zone would still be 1000 miles wide, and local noon would still be when the sun was at its zenith.</p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t they all just move to Mecca?  Then they can live in their &#8220;True Center of the Earth&#8221; and never have to worry about the modern world imposing civilization on them.  Good riddens.  </p>

					<p>The fact is that even though the Islamic civilization was quite advanced at their time, after 1500 AD Europe definitely overtook it. And overtook it and other civilizations by a big margin. This has been a shock to muslims that a civilization of Khufrs (non-believer) have achieved so much. Besides modern science threatens to expose the Koran as a book written by a man or men rather than the word of God as muslims believe. Thus this desire to reconcile modern science with the Koran and claim that all the science and technology that Europe and North America has discovered/ invented was there in the Koran all along. One wonders why did the Caliph of Baghdad ride a flea infested camel while his scholars could have built an automobile or an aeroplane just by reading some verses in the Koran. <br>
   In some Islamic books it is written that the upper parts of the atmosphere were reserved for Mohamed alone. But when Laika the dog and Yuri Gagarin went to space this definitely proved them wrong. So the mullahs claimed that their rockets went up in space in chariots, the same way Mohamed had gone to the heavens. Not only muslims but Hindus too try to come up with ridiculous and funny  theories about how their ancestors invented everything Europe invented at a time when apparently according to them Europeans were living in caves. All this because they just cannot accept the harsh reality that the entire modern technological world was the work of genius of the European mind. If you want to see an Islamocentrist, Hinducentrist or an Afrocentrist&rsquo;s head burst with anger, gift them Charles Murray&rsquo;s remarkable book Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 BC to 1950.<br><br>

					<p>One tactical nuke is all it would take to end the problem of islam in the world forever after.  Destroy mecca and you destroy islam.  Islam exists for only one purpose&hellip;.to enslave the entire world to a caliphate located in mecca.  This becomes impossible if no such place exists.</p>
<p>More importantly, it would completely destroy the faith of muslims.  No matter how bad things are for them, they always insist that victory will one day be theirs because God is on their side.  They claim divine providence.  What would happen to them if we <span class="caps">FORCED </span>them to see that isn&rsquo;t true.  The most humiliating, utter, undeniable defeat&hellip;.total in every way.  Never again would anyone believe the lies of islam.  The entire fascist cult would be wiped from the earth in a single stroke.</p>

					<p>Since when should anyone go by what a Muslim cleric or scientist says? Their interpretations, beliefs, and schools of thought are based on fundamentalism. </p>
<p>Muhammad won followers in Mecca to start an Islamic community in Medina. It didn&rsquo;t have to be Medina. He attempted to form his Islamic community in other cities. Because Mecca wasn&rsquo;t suitable enough for him, he settled Medina or any city, and fundamentalists don&rsquo;t believe in territorial boundaries; do they even know why exactly they hold Mecca so highly? I know what they say, but there&rsquo;s no thought or questioning behind it. (Probably because no two fundamentalists have the same belief.)</p>
<p>Even if their &#8216;underlying beliefs&hellip;in the Muslim holy book&hellip;of scholars to unearth&rsquo; is only one view, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. They play fast and loose with historical fact and traditional religious interpretation to understand the past as they believe it should be understood. </p>
<p>The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>is the greatest representation of &#8216;falsehood&rsquo; and &#8216;unbelief&rsquo; to jihadis. Because Islam&rsquo;s enemies embody this &#8216;unbelief&rsquo; principle, the 500 years from the end of the Crusades(colonization of Islam) until the French/British incursions into Egypt(leading to <span class="caps">U.S. </span>&#8216;liberalism&rsquo;)are glossed over/non-existent. (I&rsquo;ll be their biggest #1 &#8216;unbelief&rsquo;. I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to let myself trust anyone who is Muslim, violent or not?) Fundamentalists change reality to conform to Islam. Their defense: it would be a distortion, otherwise. </p>
<p>I wonder who exactly are the critics of this new &#8216;scientific truth&rsquo;? Are they &#8216;Muslim&rsquo;?</p>

					<p>If we consider that Greenwich Mean Time is an expression of the Industrial Revolution and the mechanization of the world (c.f. &#8220;Progress&#8221; and &#8220;Rationalization&#8221;), then we should consider leaving <span class="caps">GMT </span>behind. Why? Because it seems the Western World no longer believes in Progress, but is slipping into fascism. What better capital for the world than the center of its most fascist religion? </p>

					<p>Michael C. Scott - good point. I live near Greenwich in London and have taken overseas students to the Royal Observatory on many occasions. The display of beautiful Harrison clocks, telescopes and other exhibits shows why the zero meridian was established there. This had more to do with trade than imperialism.</p>

<p>I love it that the secularist whiners that despise Christianity and denigrate it every chance they get are encouraging Islamists with everything they do, because every single tenent of Islam is ten fold more damaging to them than anything within the Christian faith</p>

					<p>Actually, muslims were originally commanded by m&rsquo;d to face Jerusalem when praying. This meant showing their backsides towards mecca, so m&rsquo;d changed his mind. Now they show their bums towards Jerusalem and palestine. They can&rsquo;t all face east.. what about those already living to the east of mecca? They must face west. Of course, if they ever reached the North pole, they would have to face south and would need to fast for 6 months during ramadan. Which way do they face if they are already living or visiting mecca? Ask a dozen muslims and you would be given 12 different answers.</p>

While I know what Islam is up to and I see the fruits of their ongoing work, for some reason, I find the demand to switch to Mecca time chilling. This shows what they want; total submission. They aren&rsquo;t even pretending to hide this ultimate goal.</p>

<p>Last I heard, the earth was a three-dimensional, spherical (or at least near enough) object. Therefore, by default, its center cannot be any point on its surface. How&rsquo;d they miss that one? Perhaps the follow up question should be whether or not the earth is flat.</p>

					<p>(from the article): <i>One geologist argued that unlike other longitudes, Mecca&rsquo;s was in perfect alignment to magnetic north.</i></p>
<p>Wrong. <a href="/wiki/Image_IGRF_2000_magnetic_declination.gif" rel="nofollow">Here&rsquo;s a chart</a> of the current <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/isogonic+line" rel="nofollow">isogonic lines</a> around the world; as one can readily see, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Mecca%2C_Saudi_Arabia_locator_map.png" rel="nofollow">Mecca is well inside</a> the agonic (zero) line running from central Europe into Africa, then back up into northern India. In fact, Chicago is a lot closer to an agonic line than Mecca, and is a major railroad hub to boot (think of all those iron rails leading to the place). So <span class="caps">IMO</span> Chicago has a better claim!</p>
<p>At any rate, the isogonic &amp; agonic lines are not constant   &mdash;   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_declination" rel="nofollow">they shift around over time</a> due to changes in Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. So even if Mecca were on the agonic line now, it wouldn&rsquo;t stay there for long.</p>
<p>Michael C. Scott wrote: <i><span class="caps">GMT </span>is convenient, in large part because the Greenwich Meridian happens to be opposite a convenient spot to put the International Date Line.</i></p>
<p>Quite true, and the main reason Greenwich was chosen for the zero meridian in the first place. Mecca is near 40 degrees East; putting the zero meridian there would put the date line near the Alaska-Yukon border, and well east of Hawaii. </p>

Wow! That&rsquo;s good.  Very well said!   I wish had written that.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily know if the take-over will (ultimately) be violent or not. Only time will tell. (Certainly our present &#8220;leaders&#8221; will sell us out without lifting a finger.)  But I do know it&rsquo;s one of the strategies. They&rsquo;ll avoid the trouble of bloodshed if they can, and that statement above puts it extremely well. Why have a fight when they can take over quietly from within?  (It won&rsquo;t be a novelty, btw.)</p>
<p>The only critique I might make is that we no longer have  a &#8220;well tended garden&#8221;. It is rapidly turning into a chaotic patch of weeds.  All the easier for one rampant vine to overwhelm the rest.</p>

<p><br>
The simple fact is, Muslims do not run the <span class="caps">USA</span>; they do not have us in Iraq; they have not torn open our borders and forced Immigration down our throat; they have not choked the dollar into nothingness; they do not control the Federal Reserve, they do not control our Educational system; they do not control Hollywood, whose principle product, movies, has for years been one of this countries highest exports, which combined with TV and Print Media, both also not under the control of Muslims, gives the people who do control it a propaganda empire unequaled in the history of the world, and a soap box from which they can preach their anti-White, anti-Christian, anti-American agenda, while depriving everyone else equal time, or doing so in a highly selective manner, etc, etc.</p>
<p>No, that doesn&rsquo;t describe Muslims.  If anyone IS going to &#8220;blame it on the Jews&#8221; it won&rsquo;t be &#8220;for fun&#8221; I can tell ya that.  It will be because such a person wants to practice their freedom of speech by applying it to <span class="caps">OBVIOUS, </span>in your face, <span class="caps">FACTS, </span>that everyone can see for themselves, and that no one can conceal or ignore any longer.  </p>
<p>But, as I said, the chances are, such a person will not even be permitted to exercise their right to free speech.  And why?</p>
<p>Well, just for laughs, we can blame it on the Muslims.<br>

					<p>The reason that the Prime Meridian runs through Greenwich, England, is because the Royal Observatory is located there.  When an Englishman invented the marine chronometer, the first portable clock accurate enough to use in navigation, the chronometers were all set to the correct time, as determined by astronomical observations at the Royal Observatory.  Since the British invented accurate navigation, they made the rules.  Read &#8220;Longitude&#8221; by Dava Sobel for the full story.</p>

					<p>&#8220;One tactical nuke is all it would take to end the problem of islam in the world forever after. Destroy mecca and you destroy islam. Islam exists for only one purpose&hellip;.to enslave the entire world to a caliphate located in mecca. &#8220;</p>
<p>   Great idea. There has been such a proposal before by John Dolan in this article though he does not stop at Islam<br>

					<p>Muslim countries also don&rsquo;t want to take their weekly days off on Sunday (Christian)or Saturday (Jewish). <br>
  This comment is sort of funny. In reality the Arabs in Kuwait and Saudi have changed their prayer days from Thursday and Friday to Friday and Saturday. It is convenient for banking the Kuwaitis said and the fact that Arab money in this way compounds interest each day instead of loosing that interest for one of the prayer days</p>
