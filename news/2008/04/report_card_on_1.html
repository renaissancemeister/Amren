						<p>Girls in Minnesota on the whole perform above the national average in many key indicators of future success, but girls of color in the North star state are faring worse than their counterparts across the nation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a key finding released Monday by the Women&rsquo;s Foundation of Minnesota, in it&rsquo;s &#8220;Status of Girls in Minnesota&#8221; report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Poverty rates for girls and boys of color are dramatically higher than those of white girls and boys in the state,&#8221; Williams explained, &#8220;As they move into adulthood women remain in poverty while that gap narrows for men.&#8221;</p>
<p>A staggering 43 percent of all African American girls in Minnesota are in households where the income is below the federal poverty line, which is the government&rsquo;s yardstick for determining eligibility for many assistance programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the bright side, Minnesota&rsquo;s girls overall are doing better the their peers around the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research shows that Minnesota girls are full of promise and potential,&#8221; said Lee Roper-Baker, who heads the Women&rsquo;s Foundation of Minnesota, &#8220;They work hard at home, in school and in their communities, they earn good grades, and they hold high aspirations for their futures.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said racism, sexism and poverty all play roles in creating that gap. The foundation wants lawmakers to consider the opportunities they have to make a difference in the lives of young women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Girls of color are also far more likely to become teen mothers than their white counterparts in Minnesota, according to the study, and more likely to report sexual abuse outside and inside their home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem, the study suggests, that is both a cause and a symptom of living in poverty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teen pregnancy among girls of color both limits their opportunities for education and economic stability, and results itself from limited opportunity,&#8221; Representative Neva Walker of Minneapolis remarked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When girls don&rsquo;t a future for themselves outside of motherhood it puts them at risk,&#8221; Walker said, &#8220;When girls don&rsquo;t have access to contraception or sex education because of lack of means or health care, it puts them at risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Suzanne Koepplinger, the director of the Minnesota Indian Women&rsquo;s Research Center, said girls of color are more often forced to deal with issues others can avoid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of our girls are facing challenges beyond their years including threats to their basic safety and security,&#8221; Koepplinger told reporters, &#8220;The high percentage of American Indian, African American and Hispanic girls reporting sexual abuse is startling, and quite frankly, it&rsquo;s unacceptable.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This should not be a surprise. Most of the blacks in Minnesota are criminals fleeing the justice system of their own home state and single mothers who come for the welfare. They are the dregs of the U.S. black population. The article tries to imply that white Minnesotans are to blame for the condition of the dregs that just show up here.</p>
<p>This study was also prepared by a socialist non-profit trying to get more tax money. These non-profits are run by delusional white leftists who think their magical liberal views will inspire ignorant welfare migrants to become just like the white liberals.</p>

<p>Well, of course she said that.  Fat chance she&rsquo;d ever say their low IQs were the cause.</p>

<p>What a shocker.  Who knew?</p>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that it&rsquo;s really white privilege to blame.  Or perhaps the legacy of slavery.</p>
<p>On second thought, the legacy of slavery is that American Blacks have a higher standard of living than any Blacks on the planet.  Where&rsquo;s the gratitude?</p>

			<p>why the continuing surprize about the under performance of &#8220;people of color&#8221;? (colour if you&rsquo;re black) What do all these education leaders see in blacks that makes them believe blacks should be doing better than they are today? Looking at the african black, what do they see that makes them think blacks in america should perform equally with whites or asians? I could understand the puzzlement if say, dutch immigrants to america were chronically poor and prone to crime, because their history and culture suggest they should succeed, but 100,000 years of black history and culture only suggests failure</p>

			<p>There are far more programs for helping girls than there are for helping boys. It is an almost proven fact that girls do better in school than boys, get into college and graduate at a higher rate and have far fewer discipline problems than boys. The poor boys are on drugs like ritalin far more likely than girls and are almost forced into a feminine mold by leftist teachers. Any sort of male behavior such as aggression or rough play is labled as &#8220;adhd&#8221; or &#8220;conduct disorder&#8221; and medicated. Girls, minority and White, need to be taught to keep their legs together to prevent pregnancy until they are married. It is almost looked upon pathologically if a girl just wants to stay home and be a mother. That is what I wanted and if I had just graduated college, taken a job and waited for Mr Right I would have saved a whole lot of money on student loans. </p>

<p>Hmmm.. I would have thought, personal responsibility, morals, parental guidance, good study habits and role models would have played a part.</p>
<p>Oh and also, how is it that immigrants from India come here (people of color)in poverty and don&rsquo;t seem to associate with these statistics? They actually work, study hard and prosper.</p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;..</p>

			<p>With the &#8216;womens movement&rsquo; being seen as white womans struggle, and black activism being about black males, in many ways black women have an experience similar to that of white men. You can&rsquo;t deny, however, that for the most part they get to be &#8216;black&rsquo;. </p>

			<p>The exclusionary term &#8220;(fill in blank) of color&#8221; is highly racist. That is why we must start regularly using the term &#8220;(fill in blank) of light&#8221; (meaning everyone not of sub-Sahara African origin).<br>
And notice no mention of Asians. Because that puts a lie to the blame-whitey (racism) mantra. Asians in every category are doing better than whites.<br>
Black girls&rsquo; problems are 100 percent self-inflicted by the black community itself. Mainly due to teen pregnancy.</p>

			<p>To the 11:32 poster, I like the &#8220;People of Light&#8221; term and would love to see it become part of standard usage, as it denotes a variety of positives, from intelligence, to being &#8220;in the Light&#8221; and children of God. </p>
<p>JHD, your point about the legacy of slavery for American blacks (or should that be &#8220;resident&#8221; blacks?!) is excellent and true, and it continues to amaze me that they are clueless as to just how elevated they are whilst in a White society in comparison to their brothers and sisters who remain mired in majority-black places. But then again, they genuinely believe that they built this nation and that they are entitled to be here.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s beginning to look like nothing can be done about this. Private and state organizations can continue establishing aid sources and expanding student counseling, but I fear we&rsquo;re dealing with people who are, on average, simply without the intellectual energy to personally develop and live by the higher civilized standards required to permanently raise human beings out of brutish primal behavior. </p>

			<p>I like the term &#8220;people of Light&#8221; too. White to me always sounded plain, like a blank sheet of paper or vanilla ice cream. I always write in European on an official form. If I have the choice to mark &#8220;refused&#8221; I will always do that, especially on a job application. On my earlier post it should have read &#8220;graduated from high school and taken a job&#8221; I have thousands of dollars in student loans and will be paying on them forever and cannot get a job in the field I studied. </p>

			<p>Uhmm,&rsquo;scuse me,but where is the report on &#8220;Boys&#8221;?? Arent boys the future men?? And dont men have to do lot of stuff like marry women,have children,support families and do the work that keeps our economy afloat and not dependent on aid from Haiti? How they gonna do all that w/o a good education? I havent the slightest doubt that the same womens groups who brag about the &#8220;good&#8221; girls and bemoan the &#8220;deprived&#8221; girls and are secretly beaming with pride that the girls who are white like themselves are the ones who are doing well&hellip;these same women are scrrewing up our schools so that boys will NOT excell,so they WILL be tripped up and gently(or not so gently) nudged to leave,the implicit message,&#8221;Ya know,boys arent really cut out for school&hellip;you fidget a lot&hellip;you really wannna sit at a desk all day?&hellip;school is a chick thing,a real boy doesnt like it&hellip;&#8221;  These women  &mdash;  -and why are so many of todays post-feminist women such utterly worthless sacks of fertilizer??  &mdash;  -get the best of all worlds:white girls are succesful and adored&hellip;Check. We get to bitch and moan about black girls,while feeling superior to them but also looking sooooo moral and liberal&hellip;Check. Boys(ESPECIALLY WHITE BOYS  &mdash;  -THE DEVIL!!!!)are completely overlooked as they are handed the least education women can get away with giving them. Stupidity is thriving in WomensWorld!!!</p>

<p>America was more poor 100 years ago, yet all girls acted better. </p>
<p>Look at the behaviour of the Hollywood and Bratty Rich girls. The more money and opportunity they have, the WORSE they behave.</p>

<p>It looks like they&rsquo;ve hit all the bases here.  Taken together, this is clearly code for &#8220;This is the fault of white males, and we want white males to give us some money, or else we will continue to use drugs and have teenage pregnancies instead of doing our schoolwork.&#8221;</p>
<p>This white male would like to tell each of them in person, &#8220;Go ahead.  I don&rsquo;t care; I graduated high school 24 years ago.  The country still needs cooks and maids.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the white male bugbear did not exist, he would have to be invented.</p>

			<p>When will they ever admit that the &#8220;poor&#8221; are the way they are due to their low IQ and the poor behaviors and decisions they freely make because of their low IQ? This is true for both blacks and whites. The root cause of poverty in the USA is low IQ.</p>

			<p>Note, too, that &#8216;poverty&rsquo; in our age does not refer to material deprivation. Instead, it refers to the ratio of taxpayer provided benefits you receive versus the income you actually earn, if any. So a person receiving annual government benefits (housing, health care, food stamps, etc) worth say $35,000 dollars and earns zero money from employment lives in &#8216;poverty&rsquo; even if they are in a nice middle class white neighborhood courtesy of Section 8. An individual a couple years out of college earning a $35,000 year salary will have about a third of that salary taken away by the federal income tax and state income and property taxes. Health insurance will take another big cut. Car insurance, gas, etc. will take another bite. Food even more. On down the line so there may be fifty to a hundred dollars of discretionary income left over each month. This person does not live in poverty even though he or she may actually have a lower standard of living than the welfare recipient in the first scenario.</p>

			<p>Hummmm I grew up poor too&hellip;but we had very good family values, my father worked hard and my mother worked hard at home, they made sure we went to school and graduated, went to Church, and back then, there was no money to send us to college, but we got good jobs and made something of ourselves.  We didn&rsquo;t sit at home and say oh me oh my I have no nice clothes or I don&rsquo;t have this or that, we went out and worked for things like that even as youngsters, we baby sat&hellip;.we did odd jobs for people&hellip;.but these blacks sit home, get welfare, and if they do graduate they get college free, if they keep plopping out illegitamate babies they get paid for that too&hellip;.now hasn&rsquo;t the world changed in the last say&hellip;.40 or 50 years or so???? Yep, the government started to pander to those of color and those who don&rsquo;t even BELONG IN THIS COUNTRY!! I FEEL CHEATED&hellip;SHOULD I SUE UNCLE SAM FOR THAT???? </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m from Minnesota and the thinking here doesnt surprise me. Minnesota is run by liberal goofs with an unending well of undeserved optimism about the value of education, environment, etc. Schools supposedly fix everything. Very boring and predictable thinking. But, you know, this is all going to come to an end soon&hellip;I predict this country is going to have a collective nervous breakdown when the reality of the Chinese nation sinks in. Soon after the Olympics are over, the reality of Chinese hegemony for the rest of the 21st century will make itself known. The scenes of the hundreds of building cranes in Beijing, and the giant new factories will prove what the elite already knows: the Chinese have won. The free-trade fools sold us down the river, and they did it even after the evidence ( the gross imbalance of trade) of the intellectual bankruptcy of free-trade was so overwhelming it couldnt be denied. Add to that a lazy and uneducable section of the population that amounts to about half of those of &#8220;working-age&#8221;, and you&rsquo;ve got a disaster. And, to top it all off,  a regnant political philosophy that puts the interest of the Iraqis and other &#8220;underdogs yearning to be free&#8221; ahead of the people here, and you have a slow-mo Cultural Revolution. A nation on a skewer, in short.</p>
