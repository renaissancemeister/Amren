						<p>State Sen. Gil Cedillo is trying to shine some light on a shocking but little known episode in American history. He faces an uphill battle.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Democrat is the author of a bill that would require public junior high and high schools to teach students about the deportation of about 2 million Latinos, including 400,000 Californians, to Mexico during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The deportation program was started in 1929 (and ran to 1944) by the Hoover administration, supposedly as a way to get rid of illegal immigrants and open up jobs during the Depression. Most of those rounded up and sent to Mexico were American citizens or legal immigrants, critics say.</p>
<p>Cedillo calls it &ldquo;an embarrassment to all Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cedillo&rsquo;s bill is scheduled to be considered today by the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if the bill clears the Legislature, it faces a possible veto by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who turned down similar legislation in 2006 that was introduced by then-Sen. Joe Dunn, a Democrat from Garden Grove.</p>

			<p>Amazing that a country would think that looking after its own as more important than supplying argicultural jobs that at the time had literally blown away and left many American farmers and sharecropers on the road, looking for simple farm work.</p>
<p>Historically, the disaster set up the change from the post Civil War era of small farms and sharecroping to corporate farming developments, funded by banks.</p>

			<p>The purpose of this course is to make hispanics hate &#8220;those evil whites&#8221; (ever more than they already do).  It&rsquo;s also meant to instill a deep sense of &#8220;victim class&#8221; syndrome in the minds of young hispanics.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Between 1929 and 1935, some 163,900 people were deported from the country for being here illegally, of whom 35,000 were deported to Mexico, *roughly 20% of the total.*&#8221;</p>
<p>Basically, the &#8220;Immigration Act of 1917&#8221; barred all immigrants that were &#8220;over the age of 16 and illiterate&#8221; - since many Mexicans fell into that category, they were in the U.S. illegally and so were liable for deportation.</p>
<p>I suppose he won&rsquo;t want an &#8220;amendment to the legislation&#8221; for the 80% of illegal immigrants from Canada/Europe, will he?</p>
<p>Or will he propose legislation requiring indoctrination of schoolchildren about Southern/Eastern European immigrants discriminated against in the various Immigration Acts as well?</p>

			<p>What do you expect from the Democrats ? It&rsquo;s mostly because of them that we are in the mess we are in right now with this diversity nonsense and the illegal aliens. Their main goal is to obtain power and keep it by creating a dependent class of people who will have to vote for them if they want the government goodies to keep flowing. They don&rsquo;t care about the future of this country or the people who built and maintained it.</p>

<p>Is he going to include in the bill that these people were deported because they entered the country illegally and that every country on earth deports illegal immigrants?</p>
<p>Is he also going to copy the bill after Mexico&rsquo;s law that is responsible for deporting twice that number back to Central and South America, after raping a good portion of the women and stealing whatever money they all had with them?</p>
<p>If not, why not?</p>

			<p>Gil Cedillo is a leading racist Mexican Reconquistador in the California assembly. He is a member of the Mexupremecest hate group MeCHA, which wants completely open borders with Mexico. He is the leading proponent of drivers licences for illegal aliens, even though Mexico doesnt do the same for illigal aliens in Mexico.What is even more amazing to me is how many white liberals trust him.</p>

			<p>This article is not clear whether those that were deported were citizens or illegal aliens.  If the children of illegals were deported, it once means that America, even the FDR variety, didn&rsquo;t take the 14th Amendment literally, and understood it for its intent, i.e. to make black former slaves American citizens. </p>
<p>Otherwise, this will only serve to increase resentment and rage among young Mexicans in Mexifornia.  I&rsquo;m waiting for news about the first Mexican-on-white hate crime committed because the perp was mad about this &#8220;injustice.&#8221;</p>

			<p>In this article, &#8220;legal immigrants&#8221; are a separate category than American citizens, so we must assume that they were here on tourist visas or green cards or some such documentation.  Such people have no right to remain in a country where they are no longer wanted, any more than I have a right to live in Nigeria or France.  I&rsquo;m going to take a wild guess and assume that the &#8220;American citizens&#8221; were nothing but anchor babies, who have no claim on citizenship except by a dishonest reading of the 14th Amendment, which itself is invalid due to the fraudulent and tyrannical means of its ratification by the States.  Just the usual lies piled upon lies.</p>

			<p>I wish U.S. politicans could be a little more focused on who they are suppossed to be representing and issues that affect the American people. </p>
<p>If they can&rsquo;t do any good for the U.S. because they&rsquo;ve gotten too used to just receiving a large some of money, they don&rsquo;t have to do anything harmful. They&rsquo;ll probably still be receiving their money- no harm done to we outsiders, middle-class Americans; we&rsquo;ll get by like we always have. </p>
<p>Nothing ventured; nothing gained. Considering who it&rsquo;s coming from, that seems better these days.  </p>

<p>This oughta help prove to the lemmings that sending back the 13-20 million &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221; is entirely out of the question. If anything they should be protesting in the streets to help secure equal rights for their &#8220;undocumented&#8221; brothers and sisters. In fact, they should think about deporting all of those workings-class and middle-class whites who oppose their bid to emancipate their brown-skinned brothas and sistas. </p>

<p>It could be worse, the &ldquo;Anglo&rdquo; zombies could have left their opulent soup kitchens and ate the Mexican &ldquo;food&rdquo; available?</p>
<p>The undiluted stupidity and arrogant ignorance of &ldquo;Latinos,&rdquo; like all other nonwhite minorities in the West, is simply breathtaking. It is as if, 1608 through 2008 were measured in seconds, not centuries.</p>
<p>The USA has simply always been the cornucopia and bridge between those who have snuff boxes, against those who have bones through their noses?</p>
<p>Or put another way, no better case can be made for deporting, without compunction, 100 million nonwhites, for the benefit of the 200 million whites living in the USA today;</p>

			<p>Personally, I find nothing wrong with what Hoover did, and to say that most of those deported were legal immigrants or american citizens is more than likely an outright lie. What race baiters like cedillo do not tell people is about all the whites from Europe back in the day that were not allowed into the country for various reasons. They would arrive at ellis island and be sent back to their native countries for age, health, economic, or political reasons. Hate mongers like cedillo would have everyone believe that if one was white that individual would automatically have the red carpet rolled out for them and the american government agencies would be tripping all over themselves to do everything they could for this individual for the sole reason that he was white. This white hating mexican piece of trash cedillo should be sent back to mexico because that is clearly where his loyalties lie. Garbage like him will never be american citizens in reality, once again proving that Hoover was right in what he did.</p>

			<p>I believe I read somewhere that Mexico gladly accepted them back because we paid them $10 a head.  Now I can&rsquo;t find that info anywhere.</p>
<p>Think about it.  Why did Mexico accept them back? Why didn&rsquo;t the Mexican government do something for its people? Why would they even allow them in the country?  They had to be in agreement with the Americna government.  </p>
<p>Mexico is a government and culture built on taking bribes, but you never hear about Mexico&rsquo;s role in all this.</p>

In any case, he is just one of the many run of the mill Mexican reconquista politicians that has in the past and is still in the process of ruining California. </p>

			<p>Since Los Angeles, in fact California and Arizona in general, are now basically a province of Mexico again  &mdash;   seems like there&rsquo;s little need to belabor an event like this.  The descendants of all those deportees and tens of millions of others have basically taken over the neighborhoods and political leadership of California and Arizona entirely.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, having seen their cities ruined, vandalism and crime rampant, drugs flooding into the neighborhoods everywhere, whites are fleeing California, Arizona and New Mexico in droves.  Nobody wants to raise their kids there, for obvious reasons.  Most wind up in the Mountain States or Midwest, or in some cases even leave the country  &mdash;   going to Central European places like Austria, Switzerland, Finland, Germany, Denmark, Italy, wherever we have ancestry or language skills I guess.  Quite a few people going to Chile, Argentina and Uruguay, which are probably among the whitest countries still remaining on the globe.</p>

			<p>It is only an embarassment to ALL AMERICANS if ALL AMERICANS think so. Don&rsquo;t hold your breath on that one, I do not sense any embarassment at all. In fact, sounds like a wonderful idea&hellip;.it would improve this country totally and preserve jobs for Americans.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Basically, the &ldquo;Immigration Act of 1917&rdquo; barred all immigrants that were &ldquo;over the age of 16 and illiterate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No wonder why the schools of my childhood were academically FAR superior to the multiculti morass out there today.</p>
<p>We knew back then that higher race and intelligence norms are the ONLY guarantees of a growing, thriving, successful nation.</p>
<p>But that was why the English Church was once also called, &#8216;stupor mundi&rsquo;- her members were conversant in Latin, Greek, history, and were racially homogenous&hellip;</p>
<p>More&rsquo;s the pity we are not learning from their example.</p>

			<p>As depressing as this coming depression is, it does shine the light on WHY we&rsquo;re suffering!  Most of our woes - financial, societal, environmental, etc. - are a direct result of massive and out-of-control illegal immigration!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about time that we put American needs over and above Mexican needs and corporate greed!</p>
<p>The more these illegal alien invaders and abetters complain, the more I want them OUT of our country!</p>
<p>Curious to see how their coming &#8220;May Day Protest&#8221; will unravel&hellip;  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll backfire on these illegal aliens just as their first &#8220;May Day Protest&#8221; did in 2006!</p>
<p>Power to the People and to heck with Mexico!  Deportation is sounding better everyday!</p>

			<p>I could be wrong, but I think Cedillo is also the one who pushed AB 540 (tuition breaks for illegals at CA community colleges).</p>

			<p>Instead of propagandizing this as another liberal classroom guilt trip, and since a recession significantly worsened by the presence of illegals has hit our country, let&rsquo;s re-institute the Hoover administration&rsquo;s policy as current law. </p>

			<p>We should think of how the Senate and House will look within fifteen years. Will white Americans fight for their piece of the pie.</p>
<p>When they are down to one car or none and their kids can&rsquo;t get a decent education or a job, will they understand and make a stand or will it be to late start deportations.</p>

			<p>Cid Cedillo of course was a member of MECHA,  the Chicano Student Movement of Aztlan.  They very openly advocate the hispanic demographic takeover of the southwestern states in the United States.  Mecha chapters are all over our college campuses from sea to shining sea in the United States. They openly advocate hispanics along with their demographic dominance in the Southwestern US also taking over the political institutions  as well. They are huge advocates of illegal immigration for the purpose of adding to their numbers of course as well as drivers licenses for illegals etc.. Corporate America and our banking establishment I&rsquo;m going to stop and correct myself, I should say our transnational corporations and international banking establishment here in the United States insure that through their bought and paid for politicians and their big foundations like the Ford foundation and other foundations, that anti white racist groups like Mecha and League of United Latin American Citizens and Maldef (mexican american legal defense and education fund)  get YOUR taxpayer dollars. Thats right your taxpayer dollars. Your taxpayer dollars are used to promote an agenda against you.</p>

			<p>  Our country is being poisoned into its own extermination by the liberals and neo-conartist in this country. What they did during the great depression was to try to stabilize the economy anyway they could. God bless them!  The job force was all but obliterated soon after the 1929 market crash. They did the best they could with what they had to work with at that time. To Hell with all the whiners that wish to moan about the past. Let&rsquo;s teach our kids something worthwhile for a change. But then, that would mean homeschooling or abolishing the teachers union. As a worthier poster than I likes to say&hellip;.God help us all!!!!!</p>

			<p>We need this program again.  I&rsquo;ve nothing against illegal foreigners and I mean it.  But we are a sovereign country and they do not dictate our policies.  We have our own language and culture.  Send them back to wherever they are sneaking in from and charge their home countries with the bills.  Mexico owes us tens of billions and so do other countries such as in the Caribbean.  If we the people are not sovereign and we the people can not dictate our future then let&rsquo;s split up now.  I would rather start anew while we still can.  </p>

			<p>I often wonder where the American parents are, with college age kids who have to put up with classes  &mdash;   that put them down. Again, apoligetically, I have to repeat, for the hundreth time, that the liberal/progressive programs instituted in this nation begun around forty years ago, have just about unglued, culturally, the fabric of traditional American Society. Its laws, customs, beliefs, aspirations, optimism,etc. I feel for the youth. They are the ones who are really going to pay for the &#8220;greatest generation&#8221; and the &#8220;baby boomers&#8221; utter neglect of the nation they inherited. </p>

			<p>&#8220;USA Today&#8221; in its typical leftwing inflammatory fashion (like the &#8220;black church burnings&#8221; hoax) ran a front page huge propaganda piece on this a year or so ago, without any challenge at all. But it turns out the thing about American citizens of Mexican origin being mass deported is another inflammatory BIG LIE. NON-citizen adults were the only ones deported. But many of them had CHILDREN who were American citizens who of course had to go with their parents until they were of age, upon which many returned to the U.S. That is the little detail they leave out when these propagandists talk about &#8220;U.S. CITIZENS&#8221; being deported.<br>
BTW, I am very pro-Hispanic, especially very pro-Mexican-Hispanic.<br>
