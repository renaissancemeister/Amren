						<p>Muslim sex offenders may be allowed to opt out of a prison treatment programme because it is against their religion, it has emerged.</p>
<p>Muslim sex offenders who do not take part in the course may spend more time in prison, experts say</p>
<p>The Prison Service&rsquo;s Muslim advisor has said there is a &#8220;legitimate Islamic position&#8221; that criminals should not discuss their crimes with others.</p>
<p>Under the Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP), which treats more than 600 prisoners including rapists and sexual killers each year, offenders must discuss their crime, sometimes in groups.</p>
<p>Ahtsham Ali said he would now urgently raise the issue with prison policy makers, raising the prospect of an exemption or special rules for Muslim prisoners.</p>
<p>However, union leaders warned that as treatment is used to assess whether prisoners are suitable for early release, Muslims who have to serve longer terms because they did not take part could sue the Prison Service.</p>
<p>The prospect of a dispensation for Muslim prisoners emerged after an unnamed prisoner wrote to a prison magazine asking for clarification of the position of Muslims on the programme.</p>
<p>He wrote: &#8220;I have always insisted that it was against Islamic teachings to discuss your offence to anyone, let alone act it out within a peer group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Ali said the issue had been raised before and told Inside Times: &#8220;I will be taking it forward as a matter of some urgency with colleagues, including those with policy responsibility for the SOTP programme.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Prison Service last night said it was seeking to ensure the programme was &#8220;sensitive to the diversity of religions within the prison context&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mark Leech, the editor of the Prisons Handbook, said: &#8220;Muslims who don&rsquo;t want to take part in the course may have to spend more time in prison, because their risk of re-offending will not be assessed as part of the treatment programme.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would be quite right, because we have to think about the victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is feasible there may be a judicial review so that Muslim sex offenders get a dispensation from the rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of probation union Napo, described the situation as an &#8220;intractable problem&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;The logic is that Muslims cannot take part in offender programmes and therefore their offending behaviour cannot be assessed and they are unlikely to be granted parole.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may then seek legal redress through judicial review on the grounds that they are being discriminated against on the grounds of religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Prison Service said the programme was suitable for all sex offenders.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;Membership of a particular religion is not a bar to participation in accredited programmes.&#8221;<br>

			<p>After these fine example of Muslim manhood finish their sentences deport them to their homeland where their sexual habits are accepted.</p>

			<p>&#8220;therefore their offending behaviour cannot be assessed and they are unlikely to be granted parole.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess the trick would be to assess their behavior, before they commit a crime for which even they need to be incarcerated by the state. Good luck with that. </p>

			<p>They are not being discriminated against on the grounds of religion, they are not engaging in the program of the country of their choice, which will not work with sex offenders anyway. It is their choice to continue with their religion. Britain looks so hopeless right now.</p>

			<p>There is no effective &#8220;treatment&#8221; for sex criminals because that behavior isn&rsquo;t an illness.  It&rsquo;s self directed behavior using free will to explicitly choose to do evil behavior.  Harsh punishment and permanent separation from potential victims (if not outright execution to make future crimes impossible) is what is appropriate.  No talking is necessary so there need be no conflict with the condemns religious beliefs.</p>

			<p>Another example of incompatibility with UK,US culture.  Seems using religion to front every violation of local laws &amp; norms is the exclusive mantra of Muslims.  I&rsquo;m all for separation of them because they can not abide by centuries old laws! If they want to live under their laws they need to move back from where they came!     V</p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the Koran have something to say about the commission of serious crimes in the first place?  If they didn&rsquo;t follow their religion then, why should they later be allowed to pick and choose the parts that are most convenient for them?</p>

			<p>My religion dictates that I not travel to foreign countries, violate their legal and moral codes, then feign victimhood.</p>
<p>But seriously, folks.  It&rsquo;s time we realize that radical Muslim immigrants who come to our country and rape and molest our women are the true victims.  Our American women were probably exposing their faces or ankles in broad daylight, obvious invitations to be violently raped.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s next?  The Koran forbids going to jail, reporting to parole officers, paying taxes, serving on juries, etc?</p>

			<p>Fortunately, given the current crackdown on sex-offenders in the US, this would never fly here across the pond.  Separation of religion and state here means that religion may not override criminal law.  Anyone who doubts me is invited to ask a certain Mr. Jeffs, a religious polygamist currently incarcerated in the Utah State Corrections system.</p>
<p>Treatment for sex-offenders is generally a condition of their parole in the US.  Violation of parole means the offender simply goes straight back to prison.  Many US states now require a lifetime of parole for sex-offenders, especially those who prey on children.  A former acquaintance who once stole from me and his other friends is now doing three-to-life with mandatory life on parole in the Colorado state DOC.  I intend to keep track of him online, and when he is due to come up before a parole board, I intend to send them a very informative letter about him.</p>
