						<p>House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, D-Des Moines, said Democrats wanted to send a message to the federal government and try to deal with a problem Iowans have been concerned about.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measure, which cleared the House on an 84-16 vote, requires employers to check driver&rsquo;s licenses or other state-issued photo identification from Iowa or the surrounding states and verify it within 10 business days of a hire. Employers or their designee must sign a form under penalty of perjury confirming they have examined the ID and &ldquo;facially validated&rdquo; the employee.</p>
<p>The measure also would mean aliens who are arrested would be denied bail, and local law enforcement agencies would be required to notify the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>The measure seeks to stop employers from paying employees cash or misclassifying them as independent contractors. Backers say the practice has been used in the construction industry and means employees can&rsquo;t get unemployment or workers&rsquo; compensation benefits.</p>
<p>Employers who misclassify those employees could face misdemeanor criminal penalties.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the law could result in civil penalties and those who make false statements or conceal material facts could be charged with a Class D felony and face a possible five-year prison term.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, voted against the bill. She pointed to what she called a humanitarian crisis and reminded fellow lawmakers of Iowa&rsquo;s tradition of lending a helping hand to immigrants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what I would do or any of us in this chamber would do if we were not able to feed our children. Would we break the law or would we allow our children to starve?&rdquo; Wessel-Kroeschell said.</p>
<p>After approval in the House, the measure now moves to the Senate for consideration in the waning days of the session.</p>

			<p>Another example of something that should GREATLY disturb Congress. States are fed up with the liberal corruption of our federal government, particularly the judiciary.  They have problems in need of solutions and increasingly the federal government is part of the cause.</p>
<p>The states are reserving more and more power for themselves as a result.  It won&rsquo;t be long until state laws conflict with federal laws and the states ignore the feds completely.  This will cause mass migration of people in this country into states and municipalities with laws they agree with.  The real trouble will start when the good communities refuse categorically to contribute to the bad ones, financially or otherwise.  The problem is particularly acute because of the intense racial and political segregation in the US.  We could split into two, even three countries over it.  You can easily see the likely borders on Census Scope.</p>

			<p>I hope the states keep doing the feds job. I also hope the states become less and less co operative with the feds. Its no problem to me if the US breaks into a  few separate countries. </p>

			<p>GO IOWA!! May the other states follow your example. The Federal Government has become dysfunctional and self-serving. It may be time for the individual states to take action to save America from incompetent dictorial politicans.</p>

Guess what?  Nobody starves in Mexico.  I have been to Mexico 16 times, top to bottom.  Mexicans may be poor, but they certainly don&rsquo;t starve.!</p>

			<p>This certainly is a humanitarian crisis, {for every citizen already in the U.S.} &#8220;What would you do if you couldn&rsquo;t feed your family&#8221;? Try, join the military, get a job, use contraceptives, or go back where you came from. They have obviously survived to this point, at their former location. P.S. I have been dirt poor,and have known lots of folks, who were worse off than me, the ones worth their salt,dug in, and made out. I&rsquo;m assuming these are imaginary people, she&rsquo;s talking about anyway. Only someone who is mentally, or physically incapasitated, would likely fit her senario.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s no problem to me if the US breaks into a few separate countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  10:39 PM</p>
<p>I would put it a little differently; I would be *absolutely delighted* if the US broke up into a few separate countries.  <br>
Old Dixie would be independant again.  California would probably split in half, somewhere between San Luis Obispo and Monterrey.  The mountain west could charge Nuevo Aztlan as much as we want for the water that flows off our hills.  &#8220;Water&#8221; you ask?  If the oil under Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela is the property of the people who live there to exploit for the pursuit of their own national interests, then snowmelt water is the property of Coloradans to exploit in *our* own interests.  Empty rivers would make Nuevo Aztlan a very unpleasant place in which to live.</p>
<p>Ethnically homogenous minicountries are usually freeer than multi-racial, over-militarized empires, which is what the USSA has become.  I drove out to Santa Cruz to visit college friends for the wqeek including July 4, in 1995.  We wanted a beach party, but the police had closed down all of the beaches between San Francisco and Monterrey.  I&rsquo;ll simplify that and repeat it: The police closed down the beaches on the day we&rsquo;re allegedly supposed to celebrate our freedom.</p>
<p>Since my felony conviction was in a federal court of the United Soviet States of America, a national breakup would effectively pardon me, allowing me my 82 firearms and 40,000 rounds of ammunition again.  Ted Kennedy, a known murderer currently fouls a Senate seat, while I did three years for something I *said*.  If the CSA and the remainder of the USSA could get along, provided that this time the USSA promptly withdraws the occupation armies they chose to leave at places like Ft. Sumter, I imagine the mountain west could get along with them, too, provided they paid the proper price for water and for using our land as a dumping ground for their nuclear waste.</p>

			<p>As I have said before, and will again, any breakup of the USSA into separate nations must be a temporary solution, agreed to solely as a means to build our strength before launching a war to regain our rightful territory.  Does anyone think that Aztlan will be a peaceful neighbor, respecting the new boundary?  Would East China not invite 100 million of their countrymen to share, and expand, the new homeland formerly known as Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia?  Will NYC and its allies stop exploiting the productive parts of the continent?  Let the peoples migrate to their preferred part of the country, but before any final treaty is signed, the White Army will attack the occupied territories, with no regard for collateral damage since only enemies and traitors will live in those areas.  All survivors will be expelled beyond the restored boundaries, or put to useful labor.  Clearing out all toxic waste sites would be an invigorating change of pace for anyone with a degree in sociology, for example.  A golden age for the White Race would follow, unquestionably.  </p>

<p>This is crazy talk.  Whites gaining the US back would require genocide and dictatorial power that would&rsquo;ve made Stalin blush. Focus on saving Europe, and holding on to parts of North America.  There are historical times when you have to admit defeat, and if its any consolation whites have no one to blame but themselves.<br>

			<p>How about this, representative Beth Wessell-Kroeschell?  YOU personally pay for the illegal immigrant&rsquo;s needs and demands.  Give them your address so they can have a home to live in and offer them the food from YOUR table.  You must understand that you can&rsquo;t make them leave when your purse ends up empty.</p>
<p>Make sure you allow them to roam free throughout your yard as well and allow them to party and drink whenever they please.  When they produce their anchor babies, you must feed them too.</p>
<p>When several of their numbers assault you physically, please understand that they can&rsquo;t help themselves and that they deserve full protection under the law.  That is, of course, if you survive.  </p>
<p>Let us know, Beth, how you make out.</p>

			<p>Samuel at 11:59 PM: How would you propose to hold on to parts of North America without a race war?  The foreigners are reaping the benefits of a victorious war, without having to fight, and they will continue to do so.  They are waging a race war against us through the courts, the Congress, the government bureaucracies, the media, big business, the schools, and our rulers are on their side.  How would you save Europe?  The French courts are prosecuting Bridgitt Bardoux (sorry for the spelling) for speaking truthfully about Islam, the Finnish government is importing Somalis, the British bring in Pakistanis.  If preserving ourselves requires powers that would make Stalin blush, so be it.  Many of our rulers and intellectuals are Stalinists at heart.  Why should we extend Anglo-Saxon rights to those who are destroying the culture that produced those rights?  The traditional rights won&rsquo;t survive our extinction anyway.  What is crazy is to believe that we have an alternative to war if we are to survive.  There is nothing you can point to, no change in policy, no serious action taken, no trend, that indicates that Whites will not be dispossessed within the next 30 years.  </p>

			<p>One thing&rsquo;s for sure, you can&rsquo;t have a 1st world nation if the education of the population is lacking.  </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the white middle class that&rsquo;s the engine for the US in terms of technology breakthroughs, tax revenue and corporate revenue.  </p>
<p>So chip away at that base and everything starts to collapse. And with mainstream anti white bias that robs white college grads of jobs, why should they bust their proverbial behind?  </p>
<p>This too being the case will impede further technological advancement.  To compete in the global economy the US needs to be the top tech producer and produce products that people want to buy.  Well think about this.  </p>
<p>Most major US corporations are more interested in diversity and PC than producing a fantastic product.  Most Universities are more interested in diversity and PC than educating youth with skills and the knowledge base that&rsquo;ll keep the US economy competitive. </p>
<p>We just bought a new dishwasher from a trusted American company.  But guess what?  This thing is a piece of bravo siera.  You can&rsquo;t fit a normal sized plate in it without the spinner hitting it.  The thing doesn&rsquo;t clean very well at all, it&rsquo;s a piece of junk.  My guess is some affirmative action hire designed this contraption and instead of meticulously working on it, he was busy chasing white girls in the office.</p>

			<p>Samuel at 11:59 PM: You&rsquo;re in the first stages of a race war whether you wan to be or not. Best get prepared while you still can. Guns and ammo, water purification supplies, necessary medications, fuel, and food should be stockpiled. </p>
<p>But most importantly, your mental attitude must change. Expect riots and worse during this election cycle (especially if BHO loses, as he must). Plan your SAFE route (Selected Area For Evasion) from the major cities. And teach your loved ones how to defend themselves against the hordes of predators, malcontents, and just plain @ssh-les that will come out of the woodwork for some &#8220;fun.&#8221;</p>
