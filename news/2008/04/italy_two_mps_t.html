						<p>The only two immigrants to have been elected to the new Italian parliament, &#8220;will have the honour of representing 4 million new citizens living in our country,&#8221; Italy&rsquo;s Immigrant Party president Mustapha Mansouri, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s Association of Moroccan women president Souad Sbai (photo) has been elected an MP for election winner Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s conservative People of Freedom party.</p>
<p>Senegalese born Jean Leonard Touadi, a former Rome city councillor, has been elected an MP for the centre-left Italy of Values party.</p>
<p>Mansouri promised his party&rsquo;s &#8220;full support&#8221; saying he hoped &#8220;channels of dialogue&#8221; would be opened with the anti-immigrant Northern League party.</p>
<p>The Northern League made gains in the election, taking over 8 percent of the vote, almost doubling the 4.5 percent it took in the 2006 polls.</p>
<p>It will have 47 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of parliament) and 23 in the Senate (the upper house), according to interior ministry data.</p>
<p>Two other immigrant parliamentary candidates, both fielded by the far left, failed to win seats in Sunday and Monday&rsquo;s polls.</p>
<p>Frias Merceder Lourdes stood as a leftwing &lsquo;Rainbow&rsquo; alliance candidate for the Chamber of Deputies and Khalil Ali, as a senator for the northern Piedmont region.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Rainbow&rsquo; coalition performed abysmally in the election, failing to take a single seat in either house of parliament. Its leader, veteran trade unionist and politician Fausto Bertinotti, has since resigned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Veltroni and the left paid a high price for ignoring issues linked to immigration,&#8221; said Immigrant Party vice-president Marc Angelelli.</p>
<p>&#8220;After making political capital from allowing immigrants to vote in primaries [for the recently formed centre-left Democrat Party led by Walter Veltroni], it then dropped them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Democrat Party drew criticism from immigrants for failing to field a single candidate of foreign origin in the national election.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result, we have fewer representatives of foreign origin in parliament than in the last legislature,&#8221; said Angelelli.</p>
<p>&#8220;But quality-wise we have improved. Souad Sbai represents much of civil society,&#8221; he concluded.</p>
<p>Ahead of the polls, Mansouri commented that the selection of 4 immigrant candidates to represent 4 million citizens was &#8220;an absolutely miserable figure.&#8221;<br>

<p>What they are really saying is that they will keep complaining until they have full control of the government with every slot filled by some third world alien</p>

			<p>Actually, what&rsquo;s &#8220;miserable&#8221; is that there are African immigrants in Italy to begin with.</p>

<p> How is Italy &#8220;HIS&#8221; country? How is Italy &#8220;THIER&#8221; country? Italy is the Italians country! This arrogant ass needs to remember that.</p>

<p>Half of these people are EU nationals and the rest are largely Albanian and other Eastern Europeans.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem appropriate to me to field a black African and a Moroccan to speak for these people.</p>

			<p>   As I read the names of the politicians involved in this ITALIAN election I thought I was reading the &#8220;Kuwait Times&#8221; or some other list of people from Saudi Arabia, it WAS an article about ITALY and its elections right??</p>

			<p>I voted for the &#8220;Lega Nord&#8221; and I am glad I did it. They doubled the vote of 2006 because a lot of people are SCARED.<br>
Immigrants are everywhere, they bring crime, drugs, drunk-driving accidents and people feel more and more unsafe.<br>
The best thing of these elections is that the far left, the communists, are out of the parliament. We&rsquo;ll no longer hear them screaming &#8220;this is racist!&#8221; or &#8220;this immigration law is too tough!&#8221; and &#8220;oh,we must love the  rainbow society!&#8221;.<br>
You all shut up now, silenzio!</p>

			<p>The fact these people got elected and that there&rsquo;s 4 million immigrants in Italy is unacceptable.You know I&rsquo;ve seen on a popular demographics blog where a bunch of professor types sit around reviewing demographics issues.  And they sit there, like it&rsquo;s a game talking about how they can add 30,000 Somalis, to a certain low fertility rate country and talk about switching work forces as if they were a god.  They like these people in Italy seem to think human beings are interchangeable and that Italy would still be Italian if it looked like Brazil.  Funny thing is, when I brought up this reasoning to these professors on this blog, suddenly my opinion which made things more diverse in terms of opinion wasn&rsquo;t acceptable.</p>

<p>Well said, Lukino. Like a true Italian patriot. I am also sick of blacks &amp; muslims here in UK continually wanting to change our institutions. It&rsquo;s incessant. Every day. These globalist elitists are close to pushing white people beyond their breaking point. I wonder which country will be the first to explode. Ordinary white people whose ancestors built &amp; fought for our white nations &amp; civilizations are just cattle to them. <br>
