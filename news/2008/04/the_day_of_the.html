			<p>The event is entitled &#8220;Conservative Youth&#8221; but the poster says &#8220;Nationalist Youth&#8221;. Is that a typo or are the words conservative and nationalist interchangeable in Flemish?</p>

I like this, but see a touch of irony. Belgium is probably the one country in Europe that is most likely to break into two nations at some time in the future. They have plenty of tension between their Flemish side and their French-speaking side. </p>
<p>If the bigger question of Europe&rsquo;s invasion by third world refugees can bring the two halves of Belgium together, then it is a good sign.</p>

			<p>We need to consider ourselves in the U.S. as European-Americans, youth or otherwise. Our cultural and political future as the soon to be largest minority group is only going to be enhanced if we stop allowing ourselves to be defined by skin color, but as a group whose ethnic heritage is European. Isn&rsquo;t this what the blacks have done in pushing for their new term, African-American?</p>

			<p>They must make it clear who the real enemy is: their own elitist liberal leaders, the media and educational systems. Without them, the invasion and destruction of European culture could not proceed. </p>

<p>Why did you have to say that last part about Skinheads? Some of them are violent idiots, but most of them are good decent White men with families. Instead of demeaning them you should embrace them as patriots in&rsquo;s the struggle for race realism/White Nationalism. </p>

			<p>They better be careful.  With &#8216;Nationalist&rsquo; in the poster people might associate it with &#8216;National Socialist&rsquo;- you know those evil Germans of the 1930&rsquo;s and &#8216;40&rsquo;s.  We sure do need something like this here in the United States.  Our time is running out fast.</p>

<p>I totally understand why the poster said it!  All anyone ever sees associated with &#8220;skinheads&#8221; are Nazi symbolism and folks holed up on a compound in Idaho with enough ammo to last a hundred years.  You can thank the media, or network TV, or weird websites, whatever.<br>
Hey, I&rsquo;m all for race realism.  But what organizations whose members are &#8220;good decent white men with families&#8221; would let themselves be known as &#8220;skinheads&#8221;?  <br>
I am sincere in my inquiry and am not trying to be argumentive.</p>

			<p>I wonder if the European Union is bringing about a &#8220;European&#8221; consciousness that hopefully grows. Since we share a million years of genetic heritage with them, that&rsquo;s reason enough to label ourselves &#8220;European Americans&#8221;. An African American girl told me she was not a color but at least wanted to be labeled &#8220;Black&#8221; instead of &#8220;black&#8221;. For us maybe &#8220;Eurowhite&#8221; presents a middle position that would assist our solidarity and nationhood, and especially to distinguish us from Hispanics. </p>

			<p>This is obviously Nationalism and not Conservatism at all&hellip;and thank goodness for that!! &#8220;Conservatism&#8221; is about as ultimately meaningless and ambiguous a term today as &#8220;racism&#8221; or &#8220;tolerance.&#8221; In fact, what immediately struck me when I saw the original AR headline was that Conservatism - neo or otherwise - is hardly a great friend to the White race any longer. I&rsquo;m obviously not suggesting that Liberalism is, or that traditional/conservative ideology is necessarily a bad thing&hellip;but as political movement(if there even is a coherent movement at all) is no real help to the White race, and we should stop pretending it is. </p>

			<p>Yea, wouldn&rsquo;t that be a kick in the arse is Europe turned the corner on all this anti-white bias ahead of America.  Hard to say with the Knoxville case revealing more and more of the horror of one white couple&rsquo;s experience with diversity.  </p>
<p>Sure wish I could go.  In America a Euro-American event like this would be beaten into submission by the press as a return to the days of segregation and white on black crime.  Even though we now have laws in place that will never let us return to that old America.  </p>
<p>However, one American tradition that usually has a substantial white following are Renaissance fairs.  Sure they&rsquo;re full of freaks and flakes too, but it&rsquo;s a sea of white usually.  Guess Jousting isn&rsquo;t a sport blacks are interested in yet.  Just think of it as a drive-by on horseback only your opponent isn&rsquo;t at a disadvantage and plans to break a lance against you&rsquo;re chest, neck and head.  It&rsquo;s a concept of fair combat I doubt most bros would understand.  Unless maybe there were 5 on horses and 1 guy facing them with a t-shirt.</p>
<p>At some point you have to realize that &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; is a construct for animals in nature, it has no honor in a civilized pursuit of society.  </p>
<p>Wake up American white people.  Where&rsquo;s the warrior without his pride?</p>

			<p>The very fact that something like this *could* occur not only in Europe but in Belgium  &mdash;   one of the Continental nations most besieged by PC and the Third World invasion  &mdash;   gives me some fragment of hope that at least part of the heritage of Western civilization will survive the oncoming demographic crisis.  Continental Europe, after all, is still the heartland where our people originated, and there seems to be more cultural backbone there about protecting whites who are, after all, the indigenous inhabitants.  Also historically, many Continental European nations  &mdash;   especially Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Italy, Spain and part of Germany  &mdash;   have bitter memories of their own wars for survival against invading Ottoman Turks or Moorish forces, so they seem better able to summon up a sense of solidarity.  In fact, it&rsquo;s precisely in countries like Austria and Italy where nationalist parties have been having some success.  And it appears that at least some of this nationalism is spreading elsewhere on the Continent, even to Belgium and the Netherlands, where people like Geert Wilders have the guts to speak unpleasant truths and be listened to.</p>
<p>Nothing like this would ever be allowed to occur in Canada, Australia, the USA, UK or Sweden.  Most of these countries (especially Canada, the UK and Australia) have ridiculously interpreted &#8220;human rights&#8221; laws on the books that explicitly forbid anything even hinting at an insult to a &#8220;visible minority&#8221; or &#8220;privileged class.&#8221;  Even in the USA, without such explicit laws, the PC media and elitist social orthodoxy would destroy the career and livelihood of anyone interpreted as being even slightly &#8220;politically incorrect,&#8221; even someone making slight criticisms of our damaging affirmative action policies.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be too certain, but I suspect this differential in our nations&rsquo; &#8220;ethnic consciousness&#8221; might be responsible for the increasing emigration levels of white families from places like Australia, Canada and the USA to more nationalist white countries.  They want to raise their kids in a place where they won&rsquo;t have to worry about the kind of disastrous ethnic tension that comes with being a minority in one&rsquo;s own land  &mdash;   and the USA, UK, Australia, Sweden and Canada will all have a non-white majority by 2025-2030, even without further massive immigration.  </p>
<p>I know a number of people, including a family in my own neighborhood, who&rsquo;ve emigrated to South American countries  &mdash;   such as Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay  &mdash;   which are probably the most ethnically European places remaining in the world.  There are some who have also migrated to countries on the European Continent, and once again, the most popular choices seem to be the ones with the strongest sense of an ethnic identity: Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Austria, Switzerland and Hungary.  A few have even gone to Italy and Germany which, for all their flaws, seem likely to at least muddle through this crisis.  The obvious lesson from this: White families for the most part, just want to live in places where we can raise our children with our own kind, and when our elites pull the rug out from under us and block us from even discussing the problem, we&rsquo;ll just go somewhere else.</p>

<p>The media is going to show these men as violent bozo&rsquo;s, &#8220;holed up in Idaho with enough bullets to last 100 years&#8221;. Well, ask the victims of crime in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina if they think that is a stupid idea. What about the Whites in L.A. during the Rodney King riot if &#8220;bullets to last 100 years&#8221; is crazy.</p>
<p> Many &#8220;skinheads&#8221; cling to an ideology that yourself might find &#8220;extreme&#8221;, but that is because society is extremely anti-White. Our White &#8220;leaders&#8221; in Washington have all been bought. Young Whites cling to something that will protect them from anti-White racism. I&rsquo;m not saying everything they do is right or just, but not all are bad. 90% of these guys 50 years ago would be working in a factory as part of a union as productive American citizens. White Nationalism/race realism will go no where if people with similar pro-White beliefs are attacked and marginilized. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s exactly for this reason that - for now - we should focus entirely on the Behavioral, that is, the Psychological aspect of this.  </p>
<p>Describe how such people think, speak, and act. Create the mold, so to speak, and THEN, pour in the liquid.  I have done it before.  Yes, I know, it is kind of like setting a trap; but it works perfectly and it is NOT dishonest.  You simply withhold specifics, THEN let &#8216;em have it. For example, you describe a psychopathic personality and most Lefties will agree with you.  After you can see that they are in total agreement, simply give an illustration of such behavior coming from the Left itself.  Then watch &#8216;em go kerfluey.  Do you think they fly off the handle with a knee-jerk reaction because you are lying?  Of course not. </p>
<p>I have become convinced of two things.</p>
<p>1- the World-wide rising tide of Psychopathology</p>
<p>2- that THIS is the REAL reason the Left strongly objects to studies on genetics.  It has little to do with their concern for minorities.  That&rsquo;s a pre-text.  They are using minorities as they have always used them.  No, it&rsquo;s because their behavior is psychopathic.  But, this in no way let&rsquo;s the Right off the hook.  Not by a long shot.  For complicated reasons having to do with cultural history, the West has betrayed itself and its principle attribute which seperates it from ALL other cultures in world history - Spiritual Growth.  Those interested in such a thing have virtually NO political representation.  They are probably not even big enough to form a critical mass.  The rest are hopelessly stuck in old ideas whether religious or political.  No other culture has ever claimed to be interested in Spiritual Growth except us. And we have stopped growing. So&hellip;&hellip;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve had a pet peeve for a long time.  Why are there so many hyphenated americans?</p>
<p>Personally, my background includes Norwegian and Cherokee.  Does that make me a Norwegian/Native American?</p>
<p>My BW&rsquo;s family tree has been documented back to Mary, Queen of Scots yet part of her heritage is Seminole.  coincidentally, her physiognomy and appearance is practically pure Irish.  How would she be classified?</p>
<p>99% of the people I have met in my long and well travelled life would have similar problems trying to put the hyphen in their names.  Are we not all AMERICANS first and foremost?  I hope someone can provide an answer to this.</p>

<p>Vlaams Belang understands that our demographic decline and the lack of resistance to 3rd World immigration is due to our present age&rsquo;s immorality.  Europe is dying due to its own decadence and apathy more than anything else.</p>

			<p>TO: The Old Chief,</p>
<p>Because, no one is interested in being American.  It&rsquo;s about using America and Americans for Welfare, the Freedoms and whatever else they can strip mine from us.</p>
<p>I am also part enjun&rsquo; but do not call myself anything but American.  Actually, I only have one grandparent who is enjun&rsquo;, also Cherokee.  My family is from Alabama.  I was raised in Staunton, VA.</p>
<p>I have decided to be proud of the fact and have started telling the people who hyphenate, I am the last American.  I hope you will do the same.  It should embarrass them, if they have any love for America and Americans that is.  </p>
<p>Hopefully it will make them think twice about their &#8220;loyalty&#8221; and just where it should be.  Besides God of course&hellip;</p>
<p>I hope you will also remind those who loyalties lie elsewhere that the Country they put first before America will not accept them as one of their own, only as an immigrant and only if the Country wants to accept them.  Unless they truly are an immigrant and if they still hyphenate, they need to leave immediately.</p>
<p>They should also be reminded that while their loyalty lies elsewhere, they should not be using our Resources, work one of our jobs or using our Infrastructure.  I mean really, if it is that hard being American, why of why are they here???  They are free to live in the Country they call themselves first.</p>
<p>We have enough un-loyal Americans to deal with, we do not need the extra burden.</p>

			<p>Its about time&hellip;!!! Since history began.. masculine pride in your nation has been the subject of monuments, then since Adolf any hint at a euro type pride is considered evil. If every wandering ethnicity is allowed to have pride why not the very ethnicities responsible for the more excelent cultures on earth? Of course I do not mean haughty or arrogent pride, I mean the pride in an identity well sculpted and to be preserved.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see that happening anytime soon enough to save europe.  Things are happening in Denmark, Holland and Austria but europe is not democratic and the political elite will never allow any real change.  The power/political elite need poor people to get elected so expect more pandering to immigrants and muslims.</p>

			<p>Perhaps this is the beginning of retaking of our lands from the filthy, swarthy, welfare needy immigrant who is piecemeal polluting our culture and squatting on our lands. Long live Europeans and long live the nationalist movement in Europe.  </p>

&#8220;The event is entitled &ldquo;Conservative Youth&rdquo; but the poster says &ldquo;Nationalist Youth&rdquo;. Is that a typo or are the words conservative and nationalist interchangeable in Flemish?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, they aren&rsquo;t. They never used conservative in the &#8216;90, but, after tuning down, that started.</p>
<p>They fear that the word &#8220;nationalist&#8221; might sound too radical in the light of media coverage of etnic nationalism on the Balkan.</p>

<p>Antidote the the corrupt EU: Danubian Federation</p>
<p>Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic.</p>
<p>Good old Archduke Otto is in his upper 90s and probably won&rsquo;t be around to see it, but plenty of other Hapsburgs around.</p>
<p>The wrong side won the Great War. Think hard about what would have happened if Woodrow Wilson (precursor to Jimmah Carter) hadn&rsquo;t got the US into a war that was none of our business.</p>
<p>Try this: Central Powers win, shut out communism. France taken down several pegs, while Central Europe prospers under rejuvenated Hohenzollern and Hapsburg constitutional monarchies. <br>
Life under the kaisers wasn&rsquo;t bad   &mdash;   not U.S.-style republic but strong rule of law and rising standard of living.</p>
<p>Then a terrorist in Sarajevo forced Austria into a war that it couldn&rsquo;t avoid much as 9-11 forced America into war. The difference is that, by God&rsquo;s grace, we have managed to contain the carnage.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m being too much of an optimist here. But go to the Wikipedia and look up &#8220;monarchism&#8221; and follow the links.</p>
<p>Europe hasn&rsquo;t a chance unless it connects back to its roots   &mdash;   monarchy, contitutional of course, and Christianity.</p>
<p>I have to wonder if there aren&rsquo;t more secret monarchists than anyone would care to admit. I have this co-worker whose cell phone plays &#8220;The Radetzky March.&#8221; Makes you wonder.</p>

			<p>To the Economist,</p>
<p>You can see how being anti-gay and anti-abortion fits right in with being pro-white.  The main problem with whites is not enough of them, especially the good one.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, have noticed that the moms in the stores who have lots of kids seem to be kind of slow of wit and loud in dress and voice, and their kids unruly?  It wasn&rsquo;t like that two generations ago.  A good looking mom had minimum three kids and maxed out at half dozen. <br>

			<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the European Union is bringing about a &ldquo;European&rdquo; consciousness that hopefully grows. </p>
<p>Those of us who are nationalists in europe have no time for the european union it is a undemocratic organisation out to create a superstate which uses mass immigration as tool to destroy european natives and there homelands, but we will stand together as brothers to protect our homelands from the islamic hordes and there leaders in brussels.</p>

In other words - Europe doesn&rsquo;t have a chance.</p>
<p>Get real, would you?  For goodness sakes.</p>

<p>What nonsense!  Come into the 21st Century, please.</p>
<p>Is Britain, with its constitutional monarchy and state church, doing well?  Is Norway?  Is Sweden?   Is Belgium, or Holland, or  Spain?   Switzerland is probably better off than any of them.   Neither monarchy nor Christianity have helped them at all.  In fact, the two forces  have been eager collaborators in promoting the rot.</p>

			<p>Re:  &#8220;European-Americans&#8221;  &mdash;  America was explored by, settled by, and eventually founded by people from or having ancestors from Europe.  Hence,the use of the phrase &#8220;European Americans&#8221; is similar to saying &#8220;wet rain&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m overjoyed to see this. With Swedish blood on my father&rsquo;s side and German blood on my mother&rsquo;s side I&rsquo;m European American all around. We European Americans must never forget our ancient heritage. Unite and look towards Europe. It may be the last hope for our people as America sinks further into cultural chaos. America is looking more and more like the Soviet Union to me, not just in terms of it&rsquo;s diverse ethnicity but also it&rsquo;s repressive &#8220;politically correct&#8221; ideology. Ironically, Russia is looking better with it&rsquo;s huge white baby boom. There&rsquo;s an answer out there somewhere.</p>

It bothers me too. I bristle when I see terms like &#8220;white Canadian&#8221; or &#8220;white British&#8221;.  Acceptance of the terminology of the Left is a form of capitulation. It means you are now letting them organize and dominate your thinking for you, and that means they have already half won the battle.<br>

			<p>Why do modern liberals indoctrinate the masses to assume that white pride equates to Nazism. Proud white Americans fought and defeated the Nazis, came home and were again proud white Americans. White pride has nothing to do with the evils of a failed National Socialism belief system. </p>
<p>White pride is about promoting the heritage of persons of white European racial identity, just as other races do, because we are and should be recognized as a cohesive and legitimate cultural group with the right to promote our sociopolitical interests in this one nation under God. Simple.<br>
