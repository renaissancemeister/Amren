						<p>Black pupils should get extra help so they progress faster than their classmates, a government report says. </p>
<p>The strategy paper says all schools have a duty to narrow the achievement gap under the Race Relations Act. </p>
<p>Black pupils do worse than white ones even when class is accounted for &mdash; 25% of black Caribbean boys got five good GCSEs, compared to 43.5% of white boys. </p>
<p>Institutional racism, the report claims, is the most destructive element in the education of black children. </p>
<p>The report: Ensuring the Attainment of Black Pupils: Management guide, was produced for the Department for Children, Schools and Families by Capita Strategic Children&rsquo;s Services. </p>
<p>It offers support and advice to secondary school heads wishing to improve the achievements of their black pupils. </p>
<p>Racial inequalities among pupils who do not get free school meals are &ldquo;stark&rdquo;, it says, and argues that there may be an &ldquo;ethnic penalty&rdquo; in the education system. </p>
<p>It says the fact that black Caribbean boys are 18.5 percentage points behind white boys at GCSE but acknowledges some progress has been made. </p>
<p>It also highlights the high exclusion rate among black pupils and how many more are classed as having emotional and behavioural difficulties. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Closing the gap &mdash; in terms of both exclusions and attainment &mdash; is a question of changing attitudes and values,&rdquo; it says. </p>
<p>It urges head teachers to debate and challenge how institutional racism has an impact on the attainment of black pupils. </p>
<p>But it also says that as &ldquo;black pupils need to make faster rates of progress&rdquo; than their peers to narrow the attainment gap, &ldquo;additional support&rdquo; is needed. </p>
<p>Black culture </p>
<p>This can be either in small groups or whole class lessons. </p>
<p>Black pupils should also receive intensive mentoring to help them become effective and independent learners. </p>
<p>Head teachers and department heads should monitor the progress of black pupils very closely and identify those that are not making the expected advances. </p>
<p>They should keep a close watch on how many black pupils are on their gifted and talented registers </p>
<p>Teachers also need to ensure black culture, history and experience is reflected in what is taught in schools, the report said. </p>
<p>And schools should look at the ethnicity of their governing body. </p>
<p>Kate Daly of the National Strategies Programme said the materials were developed with considerable input from school leaders, teachers and local authority advisers </p>
<p>&ldquo;They provide a comprehensive set of Continuous Professional Development modules which schools can use to enhance their training programmes with a focus on raising achievement of underperforming groups,&rdquo; she added. </p>
<p>A DCSF spokeswoman said: &ldquo;Since 2003, the percentage increase in the number of Black Caribbean pupils achieving five good GCSEs has been almost double the national average, meaning that the gap has narrowed by eight percentage points in four years. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But we know there is more to do and our targeted programmes like Aiming High and London Challenge are helping pupils make significant progress. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Our new focus on the progression of individuals, with tailored support for children&rsquo;s specific needs, will help every pupil to reach their full potential. This is all about closing the attainment gap.&rdquo; </p>

			<p>With the massive black on white rapes, killings (modern day black on white &#8220;lynching&#8221;, lootings, welfare (transfer of wealth from the producing whites to the non-producing blacks), and so on, why help the racist africans?  Send them home and be done with their violence and oppression against us. </p>

Why don&rsquo;t the British just solve this vexing dilemma by dumbing down the White, Latino, and Asian kids like the Government does here in the States? It would likely result in producing the same equality of outcome for the &#8220;Black&#8221; students.</p>

<p>&#8220;Institutional racism&#8221; is so entrenched, that even *Indian and East Asian children* do better than blacks - wait, what?</p>

			<p>Blacks always need &#8220;extra help,&#8221; no matter where they are on the earth. They need extra help in school, on police exams, on college admissions, on parenting skills&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;The gap has narrowed by eight percentage points in four years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And we know they cooked the books to get this result. IN a few years, they will be forced to admit that they lied.</p>
<p>Of course they can close the gap. They just need extra help. Then they need to look at the racial composition of the teachers. Then they need to teach black culture. And Trevor Phillips has already suggested that blacks need seperate black schools.<br>
What extra help will be needed after none of this works? </p>

			<p>There you have it boys and girls. All one has to do is eliminate &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;, whatever that is, &#8220;ensure black culture, history and experience is reflected in what is taught in schools&#8221;, spend a ton of money on black pupils, give them all the attention, and they will catch up with white students. </p>
<p>Now why didnt we think of that? Problem solved.</p>

			<p>This is a great idea and I have no doubt it will work completely.  The only thing holding back UK blacks is their ignorance of their cultural inheritance - the stone gliders circling the pyramids, the writings of Aristotle (a black man), the secrets of the peanut as unlocked by GW Carver - if they want to go crazy, and push blacks right to the pinnacle of success, they could also mix in some fool-proof midnight basketball programs .  </p>
<p>Get ready world, it sounds like the Brits have figured out how to unleash the inner genius of their nubians.</p>

<p>The obvious solution is for these people to extricate themselves from white communities and white institutions.</p>
<p>One has to be defective or mad to stay around white people if they have this kind of destructive influence. </p>

			<p>A similar situation is going on now in the U.S., with the No Child Left Behind Act. If the premise is accepted that there is equality of abilities, then obviously it is a question of finding the causes of why there is not equality of results.</p>
<p>Imagine if there was a &#8220;no child left behind&#8221; concept as far as trying to equalize results among different races for sprinters. Imagine how much time and effort would be spent to equalize results for whites and blacks for success in the 100 yard dash, for example. Despite changes in coaching methodology and psychological techniques, and extra quality tracks, does anyone doubt that blacks would still be more successful in this field of endeavor? </p>
<p>There is a genetic component to sprinting ability, which varies according to racial background on average, just as there is for inherited ability to perform intellectual tasks, like passing the British school exams or similar ones in the United States.</p>

			<p>SO its institutional racism that explains why blacks lag behind whites in education&hellip;and so it must be some global institutional racism that maneuvered the sub saharans to produce rap music and the caucasians classical music, .. now I understand, likewise when white cultures have evolved understanding and high quality of living ..its because they stole it from the blacks,&hellip; and when the black cultures demonstrate only basic understanding and low quality of life, again its because whites stole the blacks higher achievements. Well I know how to fix the disparity&hellip;starting as young as possible teach the children this wisdom. Teach the white children their ancestors were dishonorable and stole their achievements from blacks and likewise teach the black children their ancestors were honorable and had their high acievements stolen by whites.</p>

The British government shouldn&rsquo;t pay any money for this report. That&rsquo;s because it just contains every cliche and tired old idea that has circulated in the U.S. for the past 25 years.</p>
<p>Maybe if the author &#8220;Capita Strategic Children&rsquo;s Services&#8221; could come up with an original idea, the report would be worth paying for.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Institutional racism&#8221; is code for Western culture.  As long as we expect non-White people to:<br>
Wait their turn,<br>
Earn their keep,<br>
Not lie,<br>
Not steal,<br>
Obey laws,<br>
Not insult our customs,<br>
Not insist that we do things their way, <br>
we will be accused of institutional racism.  <br>
I am absolutely serious.  What, exactly, are the actions that bring on the accusation of &#8220;I.R.&#8221;?  Nothing more than trying to live our lives and order our societies as we have done successfully for centuries.    </p>

			<p>If they have a duty to narrow the achievement gap then, as a recent report also said that lowest achievers were white working class boys, why are they not helping whites?</p>
<p>All a part of &#8220;the plan&#8221; no doubt.</p>
<p>Spending in inner city ethnic schools is already about twice per head than for the rest of the country.</p>

			<p>As Ronald has realized in the comments here, the ultimate &#8220;solution&#8221; for UK schools in &#8220;overcoming the racial performance gap,&#8221; is dumbing down the performance of whites, to bring our kids down the same pathetic Third World level.  Just as has already become official policy in the USA, Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>Schools in the United States, after decades of expensive and fruitless efforts to improve minority achievement levels to those of white students, eventually realized that they&rsquo;d have no success with this approach.  So instead of bringing minority achievement up, they just dumbed down the curriculum for everybody, including white students.  Massive affirmative action was instituted to penalize white students at every level.  College-prep and honors courses were abolished, calculus and foreign-language classes were discontinued, science labs disappeared.  They were all replaced with Afrocentric or other &#8220;feel-good curricula,&#8221; while any whites (or even minorities) who dared to achieve anything were condemned for threatening &#8220;equality&#8221; and harmony in the classroom.  </p>
<p>Canada and Australia soon followed the US model for their own fast-growing non-white populations.  In Canada, &#8220;visible minorities&#8221; are given perks and affirmative action benefits vastly exceeding even those in the USA, while the curriculum is adjusted to heap hate on native-born Canadian whites while elevating the non-whites to preferred-citizen status.  Same with Australia.  Now Britain is just jumping on the same bandwagon, and it&rsquo;s already working  &mdash;   young white students in England are now encountering levels of delinquency, crime and school failure approaching those of Britain&rsquo;s own &#8220;visible minorities.&#8221;  </p>
<p>In other words  &mdash;   equality through mediocrity, the new &#8220;solution&#8221; embraced by Canada, the UK, Australia and the USA.  This is yet another reason that white families are deserting these countries in droves.  There are still some Western countries (mainly in Central Europe and South America) that have a bit of nationalism remaining, and they also tend to value education.  In Austria, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Germany and Hungary, high-performing students are prized and rewarded for their accomplishments, and academic and professional success are rewarded.  Those countries, along with places like Chile and Uruguay in South America, also tend to be among the most white and nationalistic in the Western world.  Little surprise that there is a correlation.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me that all you ever hear is black militans (like Jeremiah Wright) say blacks have to work twice as hard to be make it.  No, they have to work twice as hard and they still can&rsquo;t make it to the level of whites.<br>

			<p><i>&ldquo;Closing the gap &mdash; in terms of both exclusions and attainment &mdash; is a question of changing attitudes and values,&rdquo; it says.</i></p>
<p>True; but it&rsquo;s the attitudes and values of the black students and, more importantly, their parents that need to change. Want blacks to do better in school? No problem! they simply have to make education a top priority in their lives, and commit their children to the study and effort necessary to achieve greater academic prowess. </p>
<p>It all has to come from the black population itself, and most specifically from the home. The &#8220;system,&#8221; indeed whites in general, have done all they can for the matter, and probably too much.</p>

&#8220;Institutional racism, the report claims, is the most destructive element in the education of black children.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that old bogeyman &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; WOULD be destructive element&hellip; if it existed. </p>
<p>But as far as I can tell it does not   &mdash;   certainly not to the extent to the extent the nonwhites (and their pasty-faced neo-Stalinist enablers at the BBC) are always yelping that it does. </p>
<p>However, I did get a wry laugh out of this bit: </p>
<p>&#8220;Black pupils should also receive intensive mentoring to help them become effective and independent learners.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they need somebody looking over their shoulder and holding their hand&hellip; to make them INDEPENDENT. Isn&rsquo;t &#8220;independence&#8221; doing things for yourself, without ANYBODY holding your hand? These leftist broadcasters and newspeople write this stuff and don&rsquo;t even notice that they&rsquo;re CONSTANTLY contradicting themselves; spewing sentence after sentence that flies in the face of reason. </p>
<p>But then, this entire article is nonsense from start to finish. Just about EVERYTHING the once-venerable Beeb puts out these days is. <br>

			<p>How it grieves me to see leftist loons hijack public education with their pie-in-the-sky notions. </p>
<p>Public schools have *one* obligation - to teach facts about the world we live in to the students that give a rip about learning in a politically neutral stance. That is it. Extra help for pupils should be reserved for the learning disabled and those with troubled home lives. What they are trying to do is effectively give everyone a personal tutor (at public expense), which is logistically impossible.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of you have heard some variation of the mantra &#8220;All children can learn.&#8221; It&rsquo;s a typical lefty feel-good phrase, and seems harmless&hellip;but what it really means is &#8220;We think all children can learn - *everything.*&#8221; Even that hidden meaning seems okay at first blush because of the egalitarian element to it. </p>
<p>The bald truth is that not every child can learn everything. Some kids have no head for numbers and stink at math. Some are loners and suck at socials skills. It&rsquo;s human nature They ignore that and try to act like every single child can somehow magically master every aspect of K-12 education. Teachers knew better and tried things like &#8216;tracking&rsquo; students into more vocational-skills classes instead of general education. That was shot down as racist. Now they have to try and turn every one of their students into a jack or jill of all trades. And guess what? It doesn&rsquo;t work!</p>

			<p>Helping minority students is nothing less than a facade to further economic gain.  Companies sell extra programs and textbook snd institutions receive tax monies for added instruction going to administrators and teachers.  University professors do studies for these new programs which are instituted for a few years and them deemed not working whereupon a new program is instituted.  Examples are phonics, decried as taboo is now back under expensive programs.  Same with fuzzy math.  In the meantime, no monies go to superior performing students who would benefit and show results from extra instruction and become even more productive citizens.  What is most perturbing is that black parents support this money drain even when it could go to their own top performers.  Major cultural differences here.</p>

			<p>Clearly when one does not admit the true cause of a problem no solution will ever be achieved. This has be proven again and again over the last 40 plus years relative to black academic achievement.  The PC acolytes are so confounded by their own lies that all they can do is cry, &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;, a term which is meaningless as other minority groups such as Asians, who are also minorities, do just fine.</p>
<p>  So if there exists &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; in Britain(or pick any other Western country) it must be of a very peculiar type, viz. one that effects only blacks in a significant way.  Nothing is said about the enormous white elephant in the room,i.e.,  race differences in IQ.  One might as well try to turn base metals into gold as turn blacks into scholars.  They have many characteristics but intelligence, no matter how you define it, is not one of their strong points.  In fact they consistently fall more than one standard deviation below the white mean.  Such a difference is huge!</p>
<p>As another poster has rightly remarked, it it folly to attempt to educate those who lack the ability to be educated.  It is simply a very expensive bit of ideologically mediated stupidity.  Yet, what a perplexing problem it must be for the PC elites  &mdash;  -as all races are equal one would expect them to have the same IQ&rsquo;s(empirically false as they are neither equal nor have equal IQ&rsquo;s), yet after the expenditure of millions of pounds and countless resources blacks in particular simply do not perform academically.</p>
<p>  Start out with a false premiss which must be maintained in spite of being contradicted by all evidence and at all costs and any conclusion you are likely to come to will also be false.  Institutional racism is like Newton&rsquo;s celestial ether  &mdash;  it was demanded by the theory(no force at a distance), so it must be there  &mdash;  -the difference, of course is that Newton&rsquo;s original premiss was correct, i.e. bodies in space do follow the laws of mechanics whereas black IQ is nowhere near that of whites or north asians.</p>
<p>One grows very tired of the same old lies, the same old solutions which have been proven to be futile over and over again, the same old rubbish.  Some day soon the modern liberal, multicul movement must collapse in upon its own weight of lies.  Remember the Soviet Union  &mdash;  -you can only found a society on ideological fantasy for so long before reality comes along and topples the house of cards  &mdash;  -the sooner the better for us in the West.  One can only hope that it is not too late.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Institutional racism, the report claims, is the most destructive element in the education of black children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice how it is ALWAYS whitey&rsquo;s fault. (Isn&rsquo;t THAT racist?) No &#8220;proof&#8221; of this amorphous &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; is ever offered, of course. The only hard fact of &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; is racial PREFERENCES for blacks, such as all these endless special programs for blacks. They are the most helpless group in the world. Every other group is self-sufficient, and many, such as Asians, excel whites. Which puts the LIE to this whole &#8220;blame whitey&#8221; line.<br>
And Britain never had to have this problem in the first place: THEY voluntarily opened their homelands to these black invaders, and created a perpetual problem where none existed before.<br>

			<p>To add to what a recent post said about wrong premises regarding equality of native intelligence, I recently picked up a pass-out on the desk of a New York City Schools teacher in a high school in Brooklyn entitled, &#8220;Principles of Learning for Effort-Based Education.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Principle 1: Organize for Effort - An effort-based school replaces the assumption that aptitude determines what and how much students learn with the assumption that sustained and directed effort can yield high achievement for all students&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how in one fell swoop all idea of I.Q. is done away with - even though I did read that Bobby Fischer, the recently deceased and somewhat eccentric chess player, had an I.Q. of 181. But then again, based on &#8220;effort-based education&#8221;, I&rsquo;m sure all of us could have reached his level of expertise as a chess player.</p>

			<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s that darn racism again, because in Africa, where most of the population is black, hence, not a hint of racism in sight, the grades are excellent. </p>
