						<p>Arizona public schools would be barred from any teachings considered counter to democracy or Western civilization under a proposal endorsed Wednesday by a legislative panel.</p>
<p>Additionally, the measure would prohibit students of the state&rsquo;s universities and community colleges from forming groups based in whole or part on the race of their members, such as the Black Business Students Association at Arizona State University or Native Americans United at Northern Arizona University. Those groups would be forbidden from operating on campus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pearce [Rep. Russell Pearce], a Mesa Republican, said his target isn&rsquo;t diversity instruction, but schools that use taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate students in what he characterized as anti-American or seditious thinking. The measure is at least partially a response to a controversy surrounding an ethnic-studies program in the Tucson Unified School District, which critics have said is unpatriotic and teaches revolution.</p>
<p>SB 1108 states, &#8220;A primary purpose of public education is to inculcate values of American citizenship. Public tax dollars used in public schools should not be used to denigrate American values and the teachings of Western civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>For schools that violate the anti-Western-teachings provision, the bill provides the state superintendent of public instruction with the authority to withhold a portion of state funding.</p>
<p>Rep. John Kavanagh, a member of the Appropriations Committee, said he hopes the measure helps return cultural studies in the state&rsquo;s schools to a &#8220;melting pot&#8221; model.</p>
<p>&#8220;This bill basically says, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re here. Adopt American values,&rsquo;&#8221; said Kavanagh, a Fountain Hills Republican. &#8220;If you want a different culture, then fine, go back to that culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The result, said [Democratic] Rep. Pete Rios, would likely be a chilling effect on public instruction regarding diversity and other cultures.</p>

<p>I totally agree with this but I think prohibiting students from forming groups based on race is a violation of civil rights and freedom of association.  If we&rsquo;re ever going to remove ourselves from nonwhites this is the path we need to go down.<br>

					<p>Cultural unity, a culture America once had, is being deliberately destroyed by modern liberals. Multiculturalism is a philosophy of antagonism to America and the West. The hostility of the multiculturalists to this nation and its achievements can hardly be overstated. As students turned from substantive subjects to ideologically driven resentments attacking the European-American culture and the white race with special emphasis on white males the quality of education suffered. Blatant revisionism took hold and damage was actually done to all groups.</p>
<p>The insistence on separate ethnic identities resulted in exclusion, tension, and isolation. Multiculturalism is a series of lies; the lie that European-American culture is uniquely oppressive; the lie that culture has been formed to preserve the dominance of heterosexual white males,; and the lie that other cultures are equal to the culture of the West. What needs to be said is that no other culture in the history of the world has offered the individual as much freedom, as much opportunity to advance; no other culture has permitted homosexuals, minority religions, non-whites, and women to play ever increasing roles in the economy, in politics, in scholarship, in government. What needs to be said is that American culture is Eurocentric, and it must remain Eurocentric or collapse into meaninglessness. Standards of European and American origin are the only possible standards that can hold our society together and keeps us the competent nation that we still are.</p>
<p>If the legitimacy of Eurocentric standards is denied, we become another substandard nation. The standards of Islam, Africa, the Far East, will not save what we still are. So the attack on Eurocentrism is ignorant and self-defeating to this country and a modern world. European-American culture is the best the world has to offer. Europe, not China or Mexico or anywhere else, was the originator of individualism, representative democracy, free-market capitalism, the rule of law in same, the birthplace of modern science and advanced technology, and so on through a list of achievements that have made the lives of Americans more free and prosperous than any other nation on earth.</p>

					<p>This should have been a given - amazing that it has come to the point that it would actually have to be legislated!</p>
<p>My son&rsquo;s fourth grade social studies book in the fourth grade in Orange County, California 1991 was called &#8220;California Gold&#8221; and told how everyone, (Mexicans, Indians, Chinese, was exploited by the whites and especially &#8220;the Big Four&#8221; railroad entrepreneurs including Stanford, future governor and founder of Stanford University. It actually said they were greedy and only cared about profit. The photographs were of Chinese laborers that &#8220;built the transcontinental railroad&#8221;. I complained about the book at my son&rsquo;s teacher/parent conference - should have kept complaining higher up - but back then thought I was alone in thinking this was outrageously <span class="caps">WRONG</span>!</p>

					<p>Forbidding students from forming groups based on race or any belief is uconstitutional and will be quickly thrown out. Who will decide what is anti-western? The government created this mess to begin with by forbidding freedom of association and allowing law suits to punish those that refused to associate outside of white culture. The government should defend the natural rights of it&rsquo;s citizen not prohibit them. Whites are starting to speak out and this is the trojan horse to keep that from happening.</p>

					<p>People should understand what is going on here.</p>
<p>There has been intense migration of people to be near those of like mind to eachother.  Our country is separating in two between liberals and normal people.  Because liberalism has proven so toxic and evil, people are taking steps to make sure that it cannot take root.</p>
<p>Tolerance, taken to an extreme, has turned into a weapon against us.  So, those victimized by this are starting to restrict it.</p>

<p>A chilling-effect on those who teach the blanket hatred of whites known as diversity is exactly what is needed. This is the best thing I&rsquo;ve ever read on AmRen. Unfortunately, we all know the kind of people at University and in the media who will be in charge of enforcing this and reporting on it. For precisely this reason more is needed than just this bill. The anti-decency deconstructionists must be deconstructed themselves in the very manner in which they continually target white men, decency and Western society. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now dealing with the children of adults themselves who have grown up completely indoctrinated in anti-capitalist and anti-values propaganda more extreme than anything Stalinist Russia could have even dreamed of, all in the name of good race relations/fear. The problem is we still live in a capitalistic society. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a better recipe for dissatisfaction. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a better recipe for unhappiness, outside of a society of overweight people obsessed with beauty and thinness.  </p>

<p>How sad it is that legislation has to be initiated to do what any fool knows is necessary to keep a nation from exploding.  And even sadder is the fact that it will never pass.</p>
<p>None of the Mexican legislators will be for it because they want to take over the Southwest and make it a mestizo enclave. And, none of the radical leftists want it, because fractionalizing the US is part of their plan to create a radical leftist entity that is comprised of tribes.<br>

					<p>The wording is far too vague, to make a reasonable assessment of their intent, however well intentioned. The chance this would be enacted, or applied is, that of the proverbial snowball. Oh, and by the by we don&rsquo;t have a democracy, nor should we want one. A democracy is mob rule. Our wise founders gave us a republic, sadly we have lost our way.</p>

					<p>Because whites are never permitted to form pro-white groups in our universities I&rsquo;m all in favor of banning the black and latino groups.  Yes, under freedom of association all races should be allowed to form groups of their own if they want to but that part of the Constitution has been denied to whites for decades, so why should the other races get that right?<br>

					<p>      Great, but maybe fifty years too late. The invaders are<br>
already here. If a law prohibts them from getting away from us,<br><br>
then we can&rsquo;t get away from them either. And who is more law<br><br>
abiding us or them? And who is held to a higher standard by the<br><br>
civil and state authorities? Exactly. This law will punish us. It<br><br>
will be ignored by them. And the wording seems to indicate the<br><br>
current confusion about our History. America was never meant to<br><br>
be a Democracy but rather a Republic in which the democratic pro-<br><br>
cess plays a role. So this stricuture will reinforce the very il-<br><br>
lusions which got us into this mess to begin with.<br><br>
      Basically, a more historically accurate version of this<br><br>
would have been a good idea back in the fourties and fifties when<br><br>
the Reds were taking over the campuses. Now it&rsquo;s just ridiculous.<br><br>
It has entertainment value. We&rsquo;ll be able to watch all the Mex-<br><br>
ican Parents scream about their kids not getting to study the<br><br>
Mexican version of history. But that&rsquo;s all. They&rsquo;ll still learn<br><br>
it from popular culture.</p>

					<p>I just looked to see what clubs would be disbanded at my school if this passes, (and having a governor like Napolitano is a guaranteed veto for this bill):</p>
<p>(A.P.I.C.) Asian-Pacific Islander Coalition - To build a greater awareness and appreciation for cultural heritage of Asian-Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>(B.S.U.) Black Student Union - To enhance spiritual and academic development through study of the bible, group interaction and fellowship. (N.B. My school already has a Campus Crusade for Christ, with a nearly identical mission statement, so why was the <span class="caps">BSU </span>founded in the first place?)</p>
<p>(M.E.Ch.A.) Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan - To develop unity among Latino/Chicano/Hispanic peoples.</p>
<p>(N.A.A.C.P.) National Association for the Advancement of Colored People - Leadership training, scholarship development, fundraising, civic engagement, and service to the community</p>
<p>Soceity of Hispanic Professional Engineers- Increase the number of Hispanic Engineers at <span class="caps">MCC </span>and promote their advancement in the workforce. </p>
<p>As well as:<br>
Conversation Around the Samavar(Russian Club)<br><br>
Polynesian Culture Club <br><br>
Study of Aboriginal Lifeways and Technologies(S.A.L.T.)</p>
<p>My goodness, I didn&rsquo;t see any clubs for Europeans! Scratch that, I did, but it&rsquo;s officially called Chess Club. * grin *</p>

					<p>Huge mistake!  I understand the impetus behind these measures but the fact is that a genuine liberal education includes exposure to and discussion of some very unpleasant ideas.  Will it henceforth be illegal to read Aristotle&rsquo;s defense of slavery or Plato&rsquo;s critique of democracy and freedom of speech.  Are the works of Aquinas really the same as &#8220;American values?&#8221;  Will criticism of Lincoln be muffled as hostile to equality?  Western civilization includes traditions that are completely at odds with the radical democratic project this country is engaged in.  This is a very impoverished response to what ails our culture.  I have read volumes of Marx, Foucault and Derrida and it has only made me more pro-American.  Get serious!</p>

					<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to define &#8220;anti-Western&#8221; education, but I&rsquo;m glad somebody is trying.</p>
<p>As for the ban on race-based groups, it&rsquo;s almost certainly un-Constitutional (ever heard of freedom of assembly), but I&rsquo;m pretty good and sure that the university would do everything it could to drive out/suspend/expose a &#8220;European-American Student Union&#8221; or any members thereof.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if race-based groups are banned they will still exist. Blacks, Latinos and Asians will lie about them while whites, once again, are stuck obeying the law, with a white fifth column that will expose any such group.</p>
<p>It should be interesting to one and all, though, that Tucson has adopted such an anti-American education plan. Wonder why that is? Have something to do with the large number of Latinos? Almost certainly.</p>

					<p>I wonder how this rule would unfold in practice on the localized basis?</p>
<p>The only thing I am worried about is the day that a groups of whites walking together on a college campus is told to not walk together unless they also walk with at least two blacks, three Hispanics, an Asian, etc.  IT <span class="caps">COULD HAPPEN</span>!</p>
<p>Our local community college routinely excludes photos of white males portrayed as students in their quarterly catalogues.  You have to search for white men on staff or as instructors.  And this is in a smallish city that is 85% white.</p>
<p>Anyone can form any group off campus.  Kids can meet in a tree-house, etc.  I am thinking of the Little Rascals episode about &#8220;The He-man Woman Haters Club.&#8221;  It turned out no one could abide by its rules. </p>
<p>Freedom of association is the bottom line.</p>

<p>&gt; Interesting comment.  I reflect that Mexico is really a nation of seperate tribes and that is one of its many problems.  How many here are aware of the discrimination within Mexico between Mexicans of different color and ethnic (tribal) groups?</p>
<p>I predict that a &#8220;reconquesta&#8221; Southwest would fall into a low production region of squabling minorities.  That is already happening in many ways.  Add to that the usual style of Democratic Party disunity.  This has repeatedly caused the loss of the presidential race over the past 30 years at least.  Their problem is that there are so many under the party umbrella that they cannot agree enough amoung themselves to be effectve.  Of course, this is also beginning to occur to the Republican party.  Possibly, all of this is part of the disintegration of America, but the chance that we will actually see a politically strong hispanic region in America will only last as long as it has something to gain from White America.</p>

					<p>The problem with a republic is that its elected representatives can be bought and historically often are.  This is the problem with powerful lobbies replacing the needs and desires of the people the republic is supposed to serve.</p>
<p>The problem currently is that social democracy has been constructing itself within our systems on the more public levels while capitlist wealth has come to own our congress.  We have two extremes of the basic idea of democracy tearing our country apart.  That is happening because neither have been working for the majority European white population for at least the past 30 years.</p>
<p>Those harping on the side of both capitalism or social democracy are missing the real problem because they think the answer lies in opposing the other directly when their own favored institution is really set to destroy them regardless of their respective loyalty.</p>

					<p>     Yes! Freedom of Association is the bottom line. There can<br>
be no happiness or pursuit thereof without it. It&rsquo;s logically<br><br>
evident, but nobody is logical in the political arena. The ques-<br><br>
tion is, can it be a principle of law? Does this phrase appear<br><br>
anywhere in the Constitutional Literature? If not, who penned<br><br>
it? </p>

					<p>Pearce is a good, right-thinking person. So is Karen Johnson. I used to live in their district. They often introduce good bills like this, but unfortunately, many of them never get anywhere. Even here in the land of Goldwater, the commies have managed to get lot of power.</p>

					<p><i>May you succeed, and show us Californians how it&rsquo;s done.</i></p>
<p>California is a lost cause. Atlas is shrugging and the productive class is fleeing here and to Nevada in droves. You probably should think of doing so, as well. But if you know any brain-dead liberal idiots who are doing thinking of doing the same thing, please tell them it&rsquo;s too hot. We have had our fill of Commiefornia carpetbaggers trying to take away our rights like they did in Washington and Oregon.</p>

					<p>Isn&rsquo;t this interesting. Now that many whites are starting to see the legitimacy of forming specifically white or western values based organizations of their own, our &#8220;rulers&#8221; are starting to view various cultural/racial based organizations as divisive? </p>
<p>This type of legislation reeks of neoconservatism.</p>
<p>No thanks.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m proud to say that I&rsquo;m much more comfortable working race realism into conversations in such a subtile manner that people are comfortable talking about it with me. I point out the unfairness of school and government racial bias policies, without name calling or finger pointing. Just this afternoon I was talking to my history professor about the potentially explosive growth of the history department; I stated my hypothesis that in the past two years our state (Arizona) has become much more aware of it&rsquo;s changing demographics and culture, and that I suspected that more people have asked to get more Western Civilization and British History classes revived, to help combat the ignorance that afflicts so many Americans who know nothing of their British roots. </p>

					<p>For those who claim unconstitutionality, you should be aware that the First Amendment explicitly and specifically limits only the Federal government, not the states (or their agents such as state universities).  The so-called &#8220;incorporation&#8221; doctrine, purporting that states now have the federal Bill of Rights imposed on them via the 14th amendment, enforceable by the federal government (especially the federal judiciary), is a monstrous fraud.  The drafters and ratifiers (willing and coerced) of the 14th, radical in their time as they were, never meant such a thing. </p>
