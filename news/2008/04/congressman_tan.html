<p>Even though Tancredo attended the pope&rsquo;s birthday reception, he was not happy with Benedict &mdash; at all.</p>
<p>The pope on Wednesday called for welcoming immigrants to the United States and even issued a statement in Spanish telling the Latino community he would urge President Bush to grant legal status to illegal immigrants living in the states.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of thing that makes Tancredo, who staked his now-defunct presidential campaign on an anti-immigration platform that included building a gigantic fence along the border of Mexico, go ballistic, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>Tancredo was fit to be tied by a line he read in an Agence France-Presse story that quoted the pope as saying the United States must do &ldquo;everything possible to fight &hellip; all forms of violence so that immigrants may lead dignified lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to know what part of our lax immigration policy is considered violent,&rdquo; Tancredo said in a statement provided to The Sleuth. &ldquo;I fail to see how accepting more refugees than any other nation &mdash; and providing free health care, education, housing and social service benefits to millions of illegal aliens is in any way &lsquo;violent&rsquo; or &lsquo;degrading.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basically, Tancredo doesn&rsquo;t want Pope Benedict meddling in U.S. policy matters. &ldquo;It is not in his job description to engage in American politics,&rdquo; Tancredo said.</p>

			<p>Let Pope Benedict confine his comments to eclesiastical matters.   It is NOT his prerogative to comment on OUR immigration policies, nor the reality most Americans have come to their senses and demand an end to immigration AND the ouster of all criminal illegal aliens.</p>
<p>If the pope is so concerned about his Latino flock   &mdash;   let him order the Church coffers opened   &mdash;   and using the moneys so industries and factories built in Mexico   &mdash;   to keep the Mexicans home where they belong.</p>

			<p>The trouble is, in the element of Catholicism, the Pope carries far more weight than a Lay Parishioner who happens to be elected to Congress.  Since Catholic theology essentially dictates that the Priesthood has a direct pipeline to the Mind of God, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s hard to imagine which side most serious white (or any) Catholics will take.</p>
<p>This is why, during the days when the Civil Rights movement was rising but there was still a lot of white resistance, southern Louisiana was always hard for the Citizens Councils to organize.  After all, the Priests there said segregation was bad, so God must have been thinking it.</p>

			<p>I am really saddened that Mr Tancredo will not be running for another term in the House.  He is the one and only straight talker on immigration issues.Every other one of them are politically correct wusses who fear stepping on someones toes worse than they fear death.I just hope someone with half of his stature can fill his shoes soon. </p>

			<p>I laughed when the Pope chided America for poor treatment of American Indians and Blacks.  Doesn&rsquo;t that guy read books?  Doesn&rsquo;t he know that the Catholic Spanish Conquestadores and priests were absolutely brutal to both groups   &mdash;   enslaving and exterminating millions?  The Spanish Catholics destroyed entire New World civilizations.  And let&rsquo;s not forget the happiness of the Spanish (Catholic) Inquisition.  I think that the Pope is a hypocrite.</p>

			<p>&#8220;President Tancredo&#8221; sounds a great idea. Had the rest of our elected officials had the courage to state publicly what they KNOW to be true, as he does, then America would still be America and indeed the 1965 debacle would be rescinded. As a Roman Catholic and an admirer of Pope Benedict, I must disagree with him on his stance and chalk it up to a misguided, misunderstood sense of Christian egalitarianism. Plainly, the Pope just doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

			<p>Of course we had to be reminded that Tancredo&rsquo;s presidential campaign is &#8220;defunct&#8221; as to insinuate that his anti-illegal stance is unpopular with the electorate.  I wonder if half hispanic Bill Richardson&rsquo;s campaign would be similarly described when he says amen to the Pope&rsquo;s sentiments of legalizing the illegals?  No doubt he&rsquo;ll be described as a &#8220;former Democratic presidential hopeful&#8221;.</p>
<p>If anyone needed evidence that Catholicism, and for that matter Christianity, has abandoned white people this is definitely it. Therefore, we should abandon Christianity.  The pope is also an utter hypocrite in that he has spoken out against Muslim immigration into Europe but expects America to accept tens of millions of illiterate and crime prone Mestizos.  </p>
<p>Most churches preach the cultural Marxist bible and make no racial distinctions, so I fail to see how someone can contend that I&rsquo;m wrong in my claim.  Our religion should be anything that furthers our interests and improves our chances of surviving.  We won&rsquo;t find the answers in the bible or sitting in a church.     </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that since the 1960s the Church has been more enamored of political liberalism, something completely unknown for the entire rest of its 2000 year history.  I can tell you that gives traditionalist Catholics a lot of heartburn. </p>
<p>But as for Tancredo&rsquo;s final comment above, of course a senior religious figure can and should comment on important issues of the day.</p>
<p>And Tancredo, as a Catholic, might want to take heed of one of the following proposition, condemned as an Error by Pope Pius IX.</p>

			<p>Comments like these make me have only the highest respect for Congressman Tancredo and very little tolerance for the Pope. </p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we could ship all our illegal immigrants over to the Vatican? I&rsquo;m sure Pope Benedict XVI would make sure they got only the best in health care, education, and jobs.</p>
<p>Too bad the Pope doesn&rsquo;t stick to religion and let our country worry about the infestation of illegals.</p>

			<p>This is why I supported Tancredo in the primaries, with money and my vote. What a damn shame this great man is not the Republican candidate. Mr. Tancredo, if you are listening: I admire and support you, and you can always count on my vote. My feeling is that fifty years from now, the history books about the decline and fall of the former United States will record that a certain Congressman Tancredo foresaw what would happen and bravely tried to stop it, to no avail. The American people would not listen.</p>

			<p>The pope is out to increase the congregation&rsquo;s size through the latinos here.<br>
The more latinos come to America, the more they take up the ever-emptying pews in the Catholic churches which equals more money and support to the church!<br>
He wants to goad Bush as a means of building rapport/loyalty with the latrinos, sort of like Bush attempting to bring &#8216;em into the republican party.</p>

			<p> Amen, Tancredo is right!   Before anybody starts about my anti-catholic statements, I have alot of friends whom are catholics, and I am only stating both their sentiments and mine. The truth is the truth. I wish there was a way to unite the &#8220;christian churches&#8221; so we could battle islam together. Benedict seems to have an agenda of his own, contrary to the needs of the church. U.S. immigration policy is NOT a theological matter. Benedict seems to be pandering to the Jews, Arabs, Hispanics, and whomever might make him a buck. </p>

			<p>Brillant. Let more third-worlders flood into America&hellip;</p>
<p>Say, wouldn&rsquo;t that be like the Pope allowing Muslims to take over the Vatican? I mean, hey, there&rsquo;s not enough diversity in the big V&rsquo;s religiosity  &mdash;  everybody&rsquo;s a Catholic. If only the Pope would give a few Cardinal positions to Voo-doo priests and make monks out of some tribe or other of African pygmy head-hunter type persons, then, as the song goes, &#8220;what a wonderful world this would be&#8221;. </p>
<p>Maybe Osama Obama should run for Pope. And Farrakhan could be the Vice-Pope. Hey, they&rsquo;d get my vote.  </p>

			<p>Wow - that&rsquo;s really, really bad. The supposedly traditionalist, German Catholic Pope was supposed to return the church to the true way, throw off Marxism, revolutionary theology, PC multi cultural, appeasement of Muslims and now he does this to us in our own country.</p>
<p>Kind of like the Queen of England reading her scripted Christmas speech to the British nation where she tells all the Brits to appreciate the new multi cultural Britain and learn wisdom from religious books like the Quaran.</p>
<p>In times like these, young bands of Viking pagans appear to terrorize corrupt old White people like these terrible Popes and British Queens. Look around and you see the bands of young, spirited Pagan vikings riding on motorcycles. Give the young lads some encouragement.</p>

			<p>I think the Pope should concern himself with the Catholic church&rsquo;s problems instead of telling the US how to handle immigration problems.<br>
I agree with previous post, let them immigrate to the Vatican<br>
and receive the same benefits as they get from the US.<br>
It is a US problem and it is caused by lack of intestinal<br>
fortitude. No one has the courage to say NO.</p>

I&rsquo;m not surprised, underdog.  The mainstream media (television, newspapers, radio, etc.) is not just a cheerleader for the elite and its agenda, it&rsquo;s part of the elite itself.</p>
<p>No self-respecting race realist can read an article like the one above without wincing, becoming red-faced, or both.</p>
<p>As far as Mary Ann Akers is concerned, she&rsquo;s just another liberal pawn, another cog in the machine.<br>

			<p>It is the supreme irony that the Pope would pressure the USA to legalize millions of illegal aliens. The same USA accepts and welcomes more immigrants (legally) than all the countries in the rest of the world combined! Would not his message be more appropriate in those countries that allow very little in-migration? I am sure the Pope realizes that the solution to poverty in the world is not to move everyone to the USA. Does he want the USA to only allow Roman Catholics to come to this country?</p>

			<p>The Pope needn&rsquo;t worry. Whomever becomes President among the on-deck corporate sock puppets currently running in the two major parties will dutifully continue the de-facto open borders betrayal &#8220;our&#8221; federal government currently enforces.</p>
<p>Incidentally, when is the last time anyone read or heard &#8220;our&#8221; media report the calculated DAILY inlux of illegals across US borders? - You haven&rsquo;t. The best estimate is near 11,000 per day. </p>

<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s what they want, ie; that we are depressed.  To me it is SO obvious that the Power Elite functions like Organized Crime and has put a contract out on White people. </p>

<p>If we can see it so can they.  They can deny it all they want, which makes them so infuriatingly ignoble and disgusting. They can&rsquo;t possibly think this is going to work.  So then what are they doing?  They&rsquo;re takin&rsquo; us out.  </p>
<p>They are forcing our hand, so that, when we react, to defend ourselves, they can demonize us, or sick their dogs on us, so to speak.  And those dogs are coming in from every corner of the globe, just as the Power Elite intended.  Evil, simply evil.</p>

			<p>I have lost all respect for the Pope.  He has no business dictating what the U.S. immigration policy should be especially when he is &#8220;CLUELESS&#8221; on every aspect of this subject.  The &#8220;violence&#8221; that the misinformed Pope speaks of are the illegal immigrants that are crossing the borders every day and are drug dealers, murderers, child molesters, rapists and thieves including MS-13 gang members and other enemies that want to kill Americans and destroy our country and because many concerned citizens want to stop this suddenly WE ARE THE VIOLENT ONES?  I thought the Pope had a brain but I guess I was wrong.  Then we need to get into the cost of these illegal immigrants which is staggering and all in the form of give away programs with free health care, free tuition, free lunch programs, welfare and on and on and on, much of which U.S. citizens don&rsquo;t get and we are paying the bills with our tax dollars and Barack Obama wonders why we are bitter.  Maybe the Pope with all his jewels and gold robes living in his castle would like to contribute to the U.S. taxpayers and ease our &#8220;illegal immigrant burden&#8221;.  I doubt that will ever happen, in the mean time the Pope should stick to what he knows &#8220;religion&#8221; and keep away from what he knows nothing about &#8220;politics&#8221;. </p>

			<p>A previous poster noted that the Spanish Conquistadores had a sorry record in dealing with the North American aborigines in the Southwest and California, in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
<p>Correct! One of the clerics in the employ of the Spanish Conquistadores was a priest named Juniperro Serra, who flogged and punished aborigines who spoke in their own languages, instead of Spanish.</p>
<p>And yet, this Serra cleric was nominated for sainthood, by his supporters, during the time of John Paul II.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&rsquo;ll help. Get over yourself.</p>
<p>I am glad this article appeared in the Washington Post even if you aren&rsquo;t. No Tancredo, no article. It&rsquo;s politics buddy, get a grip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, yes. I am glad you enjoyed the article nameless. Without Tancredo for the Libs to use as a whipping boy, where would the Washington Post and the rest of the Mainstream media be? I often fear the media will run out of uninteresting and biased stories about us. At least with this article, I know the quota will be filled and Libs everywhere will be able to sleep tonight .</p>
<p>Tancredo is just buying time until he can ink a deal for a book or a job as a lobbyist. He is perceived by many as a one-issue candidate. With that one issue being the ills of illegal immigration, he then endorsed the Republican Presidential candidate who has, by far, the worst voting record on immigration issues ever. Am I the only one who sees the hypocrisy in this? With his endorsement of McCain, I simply cannot take Tancredo seriously anymore. Tancredo can say whatever he wants; however, Tancredo stopped working for us the day he endorsed McCain.</p>
<p>You tell me to &lsquo;get a grip&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll respond by telling you we need to stop compromising. Compromising gets us nothing. We compromised on Bush to avoid Gore and Kerry. Too many idiots this November will settle for McCain to avoid Clinton or Obama. After McCain dies sometime around 2011, maybe we should just put Linda Chavez or Antonio Villaraigosa in office; that way we can say to the world &#8216;Americans don&rsquo;t take their citizenship and culture seriously so come on over; especially if you are Mexican.&rsquo;<br>

			<p>I was raised a Catholic and I was so devout I prayed and spoke often to God, when I was in grade school. The latest Popes, like the latest Presidents, are total jack. Their denial is extreme. As for the Popes, they and a significant part of Catholicism is one reason why a significant part of Christianity will go under. And not just among the Catholics. You can&rsquo;t do so much damage to civilization and not have civilization eventually remove your organization from power in that civilization. Either that or the civilization itself of the whole total Earth without exception is in the process of going under for a period of time. And people say ideas and philosophy have no strength.</p>

			<p>If the Pope were to live next to Mexicans a few months (as a normal person), he&rsquo;d quickly change his opiniion of these &#8220;immigrants!&#8221; But that&rsquo;s the point. You literally have to LIVE WITH THEM to appreciate what Mexicans really are.</p>
<p>We have [HAD] a nice park nearby. Ten years ago the Mexicans discovered it. Now every weekend it&rsquo;s crawling with Mexicans. Predictably every Monday, strewn with trash, garbage, beer containers. Fine people, these hard-working immigrants really are, right? More than once these drunken picnics are on the verge of turning into a brawl as one drunken Mestizo makes a pass at someone else&rsquo;s wife or girlfriend.</p>

I see no hope for our part of the world - the Pope is just a side issue here - as long as our elites live gated community lives. Until your own nose is up against the horror of diversity it&rsquo;s unreal, you can afford to be idealistic and most important you can afford to feel good about yourself being idealistic.

<p>Ok Gary; point well taken; and I didn&rsquo;t mean to post without signing; just one of those times when I didn&rsquo;t realize til later.</p>
<p>But, my point is, I think you are taking this the wrong way.  This is Politics Gary. How can you say that a politician shouldn&rsquo;t compromise?  But even if he shouldn&rsquo;t compromise, given the state of Politics in America and Europe for the past, well, probably since Woodrow Wilson, if a thoroughly principled man enters the kind of political situation we have today - he&rsquo;s ALREADY compromised.  He simply has no choice.</p>
<p>For me Gary the long and short of it concerning Tancredo is this - One Issue Guy, Goes For It, It Doesn&rsquo;t Work Out, What Next?</p>
<p>And the answer to that question is (again, this is only MY assesment of Tancredo&rsquo;s situation) </p>
<p>If all of the three remaining canidates have more or less the same position on immigration - than for the love of God make sure a White Man gets in Office.  Tancredo is in the thick of it; and he doesn&rsquo;t strike me as a silly man (the way Obama does); he knows damn well that whoever gets in office will be taking orders from someone else.  Heck, I think even Obama supporters know this; they want their guy in their for symbolic reasons; someone else is gonna be pulling the strings.  <br>
egot to sit in that office and I want it to be a White man; perhaps Tancredo does too.</p>

I can only imagine that the leaders of the countries of the West conveyed to him that this was not the term to use. <br>
The term &#8220;immigration&#8221; has been a major part of the propaganda war to sell us on our own demographic replacement. The last thing the authorities want is that the term &#8220;demographic replacement&#8221; gets into the mind of the people. Would the Pope ever use &#8220;demographic replacement&#8221; to refer to what is going on in the West. Never.<br>

Very Childish. No one defends what SOME catholic priests did; least of all the Pope. <br>
Secondly the Pope does wear pants. What you direspectfully call a &#8220;fag rag&#8221; is actually called a Cassock under which trousers are worn. Such sophomoric rantings solve nothing. You sound like the &#8220;Irreverent&#8221; Jeremiah Wright. I, as a Catholic, stongly disagree with Benedict&rsquo;s views on our immigration problem but that is no reason to be boorish.<br>

			<p>I laughed when the Pope chided America for poor treatment of American Indians and Blacks. Doesn&rsquo;t that guy read books? &#8220;Doesn&rsquo;t he know that the Catholic Spanish Conquestadores and priests were absolutely brutal to both groups  &mdash;  enslaving and exterminating millions? The Spanish Catholics destroyed entire New World civilizations. And let&rsquo;s not forget the happiness of the Spanish (Catholic) Inquisition. I think that the Pope is a hypocrite.&#8221;</p>

I you carry that line of reasoning a bit further, we are hypocrites for complaining about today&rsquo;s Blacks murdering and raping Whites at an ever increasing rate. After all didn&rsquo;t some White people enslave Blacks two hundred years ago?  Should we then be offering up our daughters to be raped so as to expiate our historic guilt? <br>
First of all, not all priests persecuted the indigenous peoples.  Many of them decried the mistreatment of these people; often at their own peril. <br>
Axtecs and Mayans committed terrinle atrocities against other groups whom they conquered and some NA Indians like the Mohawks tied young girls to trees and hacked off their breasts celebrate some lunar festival.<br>

<p>A correction is needed here. The invading Spaniards in their lust for gold, managed to coerce the Church&rsquo;s grudging approval on the grounds the Indios were heretics. The torture and enslavement of the Indios was done by SPANISH CONQUISTADORES   &mdash;   trying to force their dreams of gold from the Indians.</p>
<p>The Church, however, deserves a hefty helping of blame for ordering the destruction of all Indian writings and records. On the grounds it anything it contained was heresy, for not conforming to Biblical teachings. a REAL tragedy since so much knowledge of Indian learning and culture was thus sacrificed to satisfy superstition and religious dogma.</p>
<p>Unlike the ultra-primitive Black Africans were when slave trading got started   &mdash;   the Mayans, Aztecs and Incas were highly intelligent. They had a passable WRITTEN language, a good understanding of mathematics and astronomy and an extremely accurate calendar. This in addition to having developed a very creditable system of architecture. Which all flew in the face of the Spaniards, who promptly went overboard to declare them as heathens and infidels worthy only of death and enslavement   &mdash;   to excuse their greedy, gold lust caused depradations in the New World.</p>
<p>The irony here is that in spite of the furious claims and demands to rewrite history, the Afro-Centrists can&rsquo;t accept the reality that the aforementioned American Indians were so far ahead of Black Africans in so many ways.</p>

			<p>Ted Kennedy (a catholic) has supported open borders and mass legal immigration since he was elected to the senate. He has also supported mass abortion, which reduces the White population by making sure the next generation of Whites is never born. Ted has also supported high taxes that suppress the White birthrate and Gun Control to prevent Whites from defending themselves. Yet despite taking positions that work toward the destruction and replacement of the White race here in America the Roman Church has never excommunicated him. </p>
<p>Ted hasn&rsquo;t even been excommunicated over his private activities such as drug use, alcoholism, fornication, adultery and even negligent homicide (Mary Jo Kapechne). </p>
<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t the Vatican or any of the American Bishops spoken out against Ted&rsquo;s public or private actions? Because Ted is carrying out their will in destroying and possibly replacing the native White Protestant population. He is an agent of the Vatican on our soil and we tolerate him. </p>
<p>The Mestizo invasion isn&rsquo;t the first time our country has been invaded by Catholic immigrants, the first time it was during the Ellis island era when the northeastern US was Catholicized by sheer weight of numbers. Now the SW is being converted by invasion.</p>

A few years ago, the Catholic church urged priests in central Kentucky where I live to deny communion to Catholic politicians who did not support policies the Vatican dictated.

<p>If some gentlemen, who demand perfection, do not see a profile in courage here, and a sincere commitment to immigration restriction I don&rsquo;t know what to say. Quite honestly, what does Tancredo have to gain by saying ANYTHING about this pope&rsquo;s outburst, if Tancredo is merely a two faced, single issue politician, out for his own profit, greed and ambition and looking to feather a deluxe retirement nest? I do not see it. </p>
<p>First of all, Tancredo is far from a single issue carnival barker. Secondly, this courageous statement, in my mind, can only come from genuine anger at this pope&rsquo;s silly words. On what basis does one say otherwise?  </p>

<p>How often have you looked under the pope&rsquo;s dress?  There are quite a number of wanted child molesters at the vatican including a cardinal who fled the U.S. to avoid questioning by the police.  AS for Muslim imams, I am much harder on that particular group of child molesting misogynists.  As a non Catholic, I feel sorry that you still embrace a faith that is systematically destroying the white race in favor of the easily led dark races.  Perhaps you will indeed be able to eat and drink enough of Jesus to attain heaven or at least a first class seat in purgatory.  I wish you the best.  And that cossack or cock sack is indeed a dress and it probably provides easy exit for when he wants to rape a child.<br>

I compare his naivity to those clueless White democrats in nearly all-White states, no doubt trying to right a past wrong by voting for Obama to ease their White &#8220;guilt&#8221;.

<p>The irony here is that in spite of the furious claims and demands to rewrite history, the Afro-Centrists can&rsquo;t accept the reality that the aforementioned American Indians were so far ahead of Black Africans in so many ways.</p>

			<p>The pope and Vatican looks at whites as greedy and not worth saving, when I walk the streets and see white girls with black men and white people obsessed with material goods I sometimes think the same!!! </p>

			<p>the Mayans, Aztecs and Incas were highly intelligent.  ?????</p>
<p>The illustrations by Spaniards as they rode across the Mexican land showed ample evidence of cannibalism. The Spaniards were cruel to these &#8220;natives&#8221; because they didn&rsquo;t want to be eaten for lunch!  We know that people preceding Aztecs &amp; Mayans had knowledge, but to attribute it to south of the border indigenous people is a stretch, and not based upon anything but Raza propaganda.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will indeed be able to eat and drink enough of Jesus to attain heaven or at least a first class seat in purgatory. I wish you the best. And that cossack or cock sack is indeed a dress and it probably provides easy exit for when he wants to rape a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Braun:</p>
<p>Your comments should have been censored on this board, (as mine often are!) merely for their bad taste; let alone the overt denigration of the &#8216;uniform&rsquo; that historic Christianity has considered holy for 20 centuries; and your frankly blasphemous statement about the most sacred of all Christian means of grace, the Sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>
<p>I have no love lost on RC&rsquo;s (I am an Orthodox cleric, FYI) and consider them to be apostate. Nevertheless, your egregious insult to ALL of Christendom, for the evil actions of those who PURPOSEFULLY sought the destruction of a Church from within, is clearly delineated in the book, &#8220;Goodbye, Good Men.&#8221; </p>
<p>And it is to THAT sub-group (whose marxist ideology resulted in the barbarous murder of over 100+ MILLION people) and whose &#8216;goals&rsquo; utterly transformed the Roman Church since Vatican II, who are to blame - NOT the instution itself.</p>
<p>Good day.</p>

<i>&#8220;Doesn&rsquo;t that guy read books?  Doesn&rsquo;t he know that the Catholic Spanish Conquestadores and priests were absolutely brutal to both groups [Indians &amp; Blacks]   &mdash;  enslaving and exterminating millions? And let&rsquo;s not forget the happiness of the Spanish (Catholic) Inquisition. I think that the Pope is a hypocrite.&#8221;<br>

<p>It is not my purpose here to defend the Church, or to take sides.  Generally, I try to stay neutral.  But in all fairness, I must say that the Spanish priests did not   &mdash;   to my knowledge   &mdash;   abuse the natives.  To the contrary, many tried to protect them against the rapacious fortune seekers that poured out of Spain. This is well documented.</p>
<p>As for the Inquisition, that was started in Spain upon King Ferdinand&rsquo;s insistence and very much against the pope&rsquo;s resistance. It operated completely under royal authority, and independently of the Vatican.  The pope held back giving permission for quite some time.  Spain was a great power then, and even occupied most of Italy (Ferdinand was also King of Naples and Sicily), and the pope was in a poor position to resist Spanish pressure. When the Turkish sultan attacked Italy,  Ferdinand treatened to withhold military support and abandon the pope to the Turks.  The pope then relented and reluctantly gave his consent. Even after that, the Inquisition was restricted to Castille only, not all of Spain.  Do not blame the pope for what he did not do. </p>
