						<p>An Atlanta, Georgia, judge who ordered white lawyers out of his courtroom so he could lecture African-American defendants called that decision a &#8220;mistake&#8221; Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;In retrospect, it was a mistake,&#8221; Judge Marvin Arrington told CNN. &#8220;Because my sheriff said to me, &lsquo;Judge, that message should be given to everybody&rsquo; &mdash; &rsquo;Don&rsquo;t violate the law, make something out of yourself, go to school, find a role model, somebody that will help you advance your life.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Arrington, who is African-American, is a judge in Fulton County, Georgia, which includes the city of Atlanta.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said he would open his court doors to everyone on Thursday and &#8220;I am going to give the same identical speech: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to do better.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Judge need not worry. Most of the Whites, Latinos and Asians have already gotten the message.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;Because my sheriff said to me, &hellip; .&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s <span class="caps">HIS </span>sheriff now.  The way it works is that the county Sheriff is an elected official in a county department separate from the courts.  The sheriff seeks to enforce laws, refers criminal complaints to the prosecutor&rsquo;s office, and the prosecutor appears as a party in the judge&rsquo;s court.  I&rsquo;m sure the Sheriff enjoys being called &#8220;my sheriff&#8221; by this weird judge.  It seems this judge can&rsquo;t keep his foot out of his mouth.  </p>

					<p>Well, without knowing any details of the incident in question or the ideological and intellectual background of this Judge, one thing is for certain by easy deductive reasoning, and that is that he is a mushbrained back-pedaling weasel who&rsquo;s had plenty of time and experience dealing with the flotsam that was before him in Court on the day in question.</p>

					<p>Where the judge said he made a mistake, I think he had done a good job by doing that cause no one else would even think of taking time to say that an really mean it, most &#8220;whites&#8221; as they say would always look at this different, but afican-american people are just the same as you or I, they just did not have someone to bring them up, talking about everything most parents hide things from there kids, and if you would talk with your kids they would think twice but you have to make your children understand all things good and bad no matter what cause if you don&rsquo;t then others will, and that is how come all kids are getting that way today, cause parents don&rsquo;t take enough time to make sure there kids are taught all things where it be good or bad for them. Talk and explain the reason more then some parents do.  Judge I think you care who comes into and out of your court no matter if its black, white, red, or yellow whatever color they may be and may God be with you.</p>
<p>I am a white woman, so here it is say whatever u may i don&rsquo;t look at color. color is only skin deep. </p>

					<p>Come on, guys!! This judge seems like a fine man  &mdash;  if most blacks had his attitude this site wouldn&rsquo;t even exist. I think there are enough news stories to discuss depicting despicable black behavior  &mdash;  we sure as hell shouldn&rsquo;t be dogging a man who is as fed up as we are just because he&rsquo;s black. Sure, dismissing the whites in the courtroom was a little questionable in hindsight, but I think this Judge&rsquo;s motives were not ugly. As frustrated as whites are with black crime  &mdash;  imagine if you were black and decent and educated and you had to watch these little idiot black criminals parade by you day in day out! I sympathize.</p>
<p>Maybe I am an optimist, but I think the current black downward spiral can be turned around. It will take people like this judge making his presence known, and it will take white people ending their damned condescending paternalism towards the worst black criminals. Most of all, the media black out on just how bad black crime has gotten must end, and this judge was incredibly frank on this subject. He sounded like an Amren poster!!</p>

					<p>More oppression from the racist black Atlantans against Caucasian people.  These Mugabeists also are responsible for racial cleansings whites out of Atlanta and forcing them to live far away from their work places.  This is why the white civil rights marches must be to Atlanta and not <span class="caps">DC. </span> Atlanta is the center of the Civil Rights Movement and it is the Center of Racial Hypocrisy.  The Civil Rights Movement was all about justifying racial cleansing of white people.  We middle class whites have been enslaved by high taxes to pay for non-working black racist thugs and fatherless children and black racist criminals in prisons.  Also our children are denied their civil rights in attending schools and living safely in their neighborhoods.  March brothers march!</p>

<p>Oh boy. Another naive, brainwashed White female. Why don&rsquo;t you take that philosophy of yours and try walking the streets of Watts, Newark, Gary or any other majority-black city or town.</p>
<p>Assuming you <span class="caps">DID </span>survive your tour-of-duty, I bet your naivete would change to wisdom and your idealism for the security of realism. You&rsquo;d never set foot in one of those areas again for the rest of your life. Then we&rsquo;d see if you still believed that &#8220;color is only skin deep.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Beth, <br>
Seriously, show us by example. Give us leadership on the subject of race.  Sell your home and buy a place in a black neighborhood.  Then take strolls at night to introduce yourself to your new neighbors.  Offer helpful tips on how they can better themselves by paying attention in school, working harder, and focusing on solutions to their problems.  Then we will all see the light that you&rsquo;ll have brought to this terrible problem.  Now don&rsquo;t report back until you&rsquo;ve done this, ok?  It&rsquo;ll be great to hear about your most assured success.  We&rsquo;re all counting on you.</p>

<p>I imagine that&rsquo;s just the more personal way of speaking found in the South, that I remember from growing up there.</p>
<p>Similarly in Mexico, an officer addressing his general frequently would begin, &#8220;Mi general,..&#8221; (&#8220;My general,..)</p>
<p>I have no problem with what this judge originally did. One way in which the failure of integration is noted is the varying degrees of separateness from everything white many blacks feel. The judge tried to make the situation feel like all-in-the-family to these criminals, in hopes of reaching them, instead of having them be closed up and made more resentful by being upbraided in the presence of Whitey. </p>
<p>But in the long run, we want to re-establish that their behavior must be acceptable to the requirements of white society. Even if we succeed in letting integration die a natural death by removing all the legal impediments to its demise, and they are once again mercifully in their own neighborhoods and schools.</p>

					<p>We really need white and black courtrooms so maybe he will start something here. Let blacks try black on black crime but let whites try black on white crime. This way we can get good verdicts without black bias with the so prevalent black on white crime.</p>

					<p>When did this term, &#8220;color of one&rsquo;s skin&#8221; come into play and what is the reason for it?  I think most of us know the answer to that one. </p>
<p>Beth, I hate to tell you, but it isn&rsquo;t the &#8220;color&#8221; of one&rsquo;s skin that is the problem. It is <span class="caps">RACE</span>! I don&rsquo;t discriminate against White people with &#8220;tans&#8221;. </p>
<p>Typical White female in today&rsquo;s America. Even though I am a White female, I have never bought into this &#8220;we are all the same&#8221; drivel that people like you can&rsquo;t seem to resist. </p>

					<p>As an Atlanta resident and damn-near native (more than 30 yrs), I say Marvin Arrington is OK by Atlanta standards. For competence and integrity, we&rsquo;re not exactly Nebraska but <span class="caps">OTOH </span>not Boston or New Orleans either.</p>
<p>I do doubt/dispute the 99.9% black stat. The last time I was called to jury duty, the actual majority of the perps on our docket seemed to be Hispanic! This is in Atlanta where the native-born black population can hold their on in casual criminality with anybody, and they are strongly reinforced by internal immigrants returning from the Rust Belt and (cringe) <span class="caps">LA.</span> I think the black criminal population here largely preys on its own kind by impulsive violent crime and on whites by aggressive street crime. The Hispanics seem to excel at slightly more professional violent crime and in lots of alcohol-related traffic deaths. You can always guess the ethnicity of the guy who killed a suburban couple and their kids by smashing into their mini-van with his pickup while driving wrong-way on I-95. For our new guests to make a mark as dangerous criminals and lethal drunk drivers in our league is quite an accomplishment. When O&rsquo;Cain or Obama invite all of them in, the sky (or hell) is the limit.<br>

					<p>Beth, Atlanta is one of many cities where the high black population has resulted in a high crime rate (in this case, 5 times the average). I doubt you&rsquo;d agree to walk through the south side of the city at night,even day time.</p>

					<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard on the judge. Blacks rarely, if ever, apologize for their actions. Why should they? </p>
<p>The moment any white people starts to ctiticize any black for anything other black people immediately circle the wagons.</p>

					<p>i agree with the judge, its not about race, he just wanted to talk with his own race about getting their life&rsquo;s together.  it&rsquo;s ok if whites do the crime etc., but he&rsquo;s trying to straightened out the black.  </p>
<p>my only concern is if he had been white and had kicked out blacks would the situation been handled the same.  if so, good for him.  but he want lose his job, will he?</p>

					<p>&#8220;He doesn&rsquo;t have to worry. Nothing will happen to him. He won&rsquo;t be forced to resign.&#8221;   &mdash;   from 2nd comment</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely correct. It became a minor news story, but that&rsquo;s the worst of it, and now there will be no further problems for him, I&rsquo;m sure. Of course, this would not be the case if he were white and had cleared the room of blacks.</p>
<p>Media elites, as well as racial pressure groups (ADL, <span class="caps">SPLC, </span>etc.) will of course do and say nothing about his casual act of discrimination. No calls for his resignation. No hostile editorials. I suppose one could say he really meant no harm. When whites act on tribal affinities the way this judge did, they truly mean no harm either. How whites are treated for acting only human, however, elicits hysterical wrath from these media elites. Politicians, like Pavlovian conditioned dogs, will froth at the mouth and have a self-righteous snit about prejudice and bigotry. These cultural patterns are predictable, stupid, and annoying.</p>
<p>Left-wing windbags love to yap about &#8220;white privilege&#8221;, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d be open to the concept of &#8220;black privilege&#8221;.<br>
When Mary Frances Berry, head of the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Commission on Civil Rights said &#8220;Civil Rights laws were not passed to protect the rights of white men and do not apply to them.&#8221;, it brought almost no attention from opinion elites and didn&rsquo;t cost her that job or any future careers. She is currently employed by the University of Pennsylvania. In the book A Killing Rage, Bell Hooks comments, &#8220;I am writing this essay sitting beside an anonymous white male that I long to murder.&#8221;  Bookstore chains still carry her books. No outcry. American Renaissance readers know the list of these double standards goes on and on.</p>
<p>American media, American politicians, and others who should be in a position of responsibility enable this. They help create and tolerate a double standard where whites must constantly watch what they say and blacks can be instantly forgiven for almost any comment or action. Looks like black privilege to me. </p>

					<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t want them to think I was talking down to them; trying to embarrass them or insult them; be derogatory toward them, and I was just saying, &#8216;Please get yourself together,&rsquo;&#8221; Arrington said.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kidding isn&rsquo;t he?  I mean nobody with half a brain would care whether hardened criminals were insulted or embarrased would he?  They repeatedly come into his court and he thinks that saying, &#8220;Please get yourself together,&#8221; is going to turn them around?  </p>
<p>It looks like he&rsquo;s especially worried about offending them.  I wonder which one he worries about insulting or offending the most.  The rapist?  The mugger who assaults the elderly and disabled?  Or maybe it&rsquo;s the dope dealers who sell at the local schools.</p>
<p>Is there anybody but me who thinks this guy got his law degree and license as a freebie via affirmative action?</p>
