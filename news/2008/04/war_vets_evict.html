						<p>More than 60 mostly white Zimbabwean farmers have been evicted from their land by war veterans loyal to President Robert Mugabe since the weekend, a farmers&rsquo; union said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation is very severe. The evictions are continuing right round the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have over 60 farmers evicted as of this morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every couple of minutes my phone is ringing with another case of eviction,&#8221; Commercial Farmers&rsquo; Union President Trevor Gifford told Reuters.</p>
<p>The veterans have been used as political shock troops by President Robert Mugabe.</p>
<p><b>One black farmer &lsquo;also evicted&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The opposition MDC argued in the High Court on Tuesday that the results of the presidential election on March 29 should be released immediately to end a 10-day political stalemate.</p>
<p>Gifford said farmers were forced to leave with only the clothes they were wearing and at least one black farmer was evicted as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;His workers&rsquo; houses have all been burnt and he&rsquo;s been accused of voting for the opposition MDC,&#8221; Gifford said.</p>
<p>The veterans said last week they would invade all remaining white-owned farms after reports that white farmers were preparing to grab back farms seized under Mugabe&rsquo;s land reforms.</p>
<p>The veterans led a wave of violent occupations of white farms as part of reforms that began in 2000.</p>
<p>Mugabe&rsquo;s critics say the reforms played a big part in ruining the economy. He blames Western sanctions for the economic damage.</p>
<p>Zimbabwean police were not immediately available for comment.<br>

			<p>If black farmers want to displace white farmers, then let them,just as long as the whites have a decent place to go.The more food that the white farmers make, then the more hordes of babies the blacks will make, and the more food that they will eventually need. The much less efficient black farmers will make much less food, and that will translate into not quite as many new blacks being made, and not as much need for more food.</p>

			<p>I say we whites should emulate the actions of the blacks. Let us &#8216;evict&rsquo; them from our collective lives altogether. No more food aid, no more antibiotics, no more industrial equipment, no more cars, no more airplanes, no more of anything to these thankless beastial creatures. Take everything away, turn our backs on them, and let them all rot in hell. Since given self governing power they have consistently acted in a genocidal fashion toward whites. I say we return the favor!!!!!</p>

<p>Mugabe BLAMES Western sanctions for the economic damage! These are the sanctions that led to the end of apartheid, so he&rsquo;s right&hellip;</p>

			<p>It is an outrage if we give so much as one cent to Zimbabwe.  Why is this not world-wide news?  Since the white governments in SA and Rhodesia were disbanded black suffering has increased a thousand fold.  I demand the US give no more aid to anyone in Africa.</p>

			<p>I hate to see the talented farmers of Zimbabwe evicted as they have been, but there is a certain amount of shadenfreude watching mugabes people starve.We have seen it coming for years, but then again, we are the crazy, forward thinking breed. <br>
 Not one nickel of public aid for zimbabwe!</p>

			<p>These Rhodesians must be naive to have stayed behind after all that has happened in the past. I thought all the whites have left Zimbabwe right now. There is also news that the blacks have started attacking the small Asian (mostly south Asians like Indians) community. Without both whites and asians, Zimbabwe will go back to the stone age or become a pseudo colony of China.</p>

			<p>War veterans, huh?  Didn&rsquo;t the war end in the late 70s?  Even the very youngest of the fighters would be nearly 50 now, with many pushing 60.  For some reason the press seems to uncritically play along with this obviously false designation for people who are no doubt young thugs with nothing to lose in the employ of Mugabe. Most of whom, I would guess, had not even been born at the time the war was going on.</p>

<p>I know you mean well but it is extremely difficult, very expensive, and takes years for SA Whites to obtain US citizenship. Most families eventually give up or look for alternatives.</p>
<p>Also: Do you see the pattern here?? Blacks simultaneously want to rid their own countries of Whites, and then flee to White countries when they&rsquo;ve succeeded (the US, Europe and SA - which cannot be called a white country any more but still offers free services to regugees from other African countries). They hate Whites but are completely dependant on Whites at the same time. </p>

			<p>Millions are starving in South Africa and Zimbabwe since the end of white rule. Therefore, anyone who supported the overthrow of apartheid is guilty of genocide. Don&rsquo;t forget to tell them that. </p>

			<p>Saw a clip of Mugabe&rsquo;s henchmen and henchwomen evicting a white farmer. They immediately began destroying the farm. Besides setting outbuildings on fire, I think I saw one of them attacking an air conditioner at the main house. How are they supposed to grow crops when they destroy everything used to grow crops?</p>

			<p>Given that the average male life expectancy after 27 years of black misrule is now 37, I somehow doubt many of these &#8220;war veterans&#8221; were actually old enough to fight in the 70s. I suppose a lot of the deaths due to hunger and disease are to babies and children and most of the AIDS deaths are to young adults and that once a Zimbabwean has got past those years he&rsquo;s more likely to live to old age, but I&rsquo;m still dubious about these &#8220;war veterans&#8221;.</p>

<p>The same thing happened everywhere, not just with blacks.  The Algerians fought a long and bloody civil war to kick out the French - not just French rule, but ethnic French people.  Immediately after winning their independence, they all decided they wanted to move to France, and called the French racist for not wanting to let them in.</p>

			<p>Yes, of course it would be great if the US allowed the Whites from South Africa and Zimbabwe to come over, but it will never happen.  You see, it&rsquo;s almost impossible for Whites to reach our shores from across the Atlantic.  Almost like the US government doesn&rsquo;t want anybody who will be productive and ambitious to come here, just the third-world labor workers are allowed to do that.</p>

You&rsquo;re dreaming.  Don&rsquo;t ever forget that blacks are the Nazis and whites are the Jews in this conflict.  You better watch what you say, or else there will be a knock on your door at four in the morning and you&rsquo;ll be taken away to parts unknown.</p>

			<p>Not many people know but one of the reasons for the current high prices of food around the world are exactly this crimes against white farmers in SA and Zimbabwe. It will get worst with every year passing and eventually SA would be an importer of food like all other African nations (it is importing food even now - something that would be ridiculous before 91.) The food in SA is excellent quality - I always enjoy buying pears grown there but I guess this won&rsquo;t continue for long now&hellip;</p>

			<p>Because of the black on white genocide there, I would send an army in a cut out a piece of Zimbabwe that would be off limits to the racist black african thugs and only for the oppressed white people there.</p>
