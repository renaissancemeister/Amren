			<p>What for?  To keep MSU&rsquo;s students from attending their left-wing brainwashing (&#8220;The US stole the southwest from Mexico&#8221;) known as college courses?</p>

			<p>Demanding that illegal aliens be given amnesty simply because they are considered racial, tribal members, which is where their loyalty lies and not with their non-Hispanic countrymen or their country, is just further proof that non-whites have no loyalty to this country or it&rsquo;s citizens if they are not Hispanic.</p>
<p>And when this incident is considered with others involving blacks revealing the same racial bias, plus the numerous incidents of fractious tribal fights, riots, and killings, it is quite clear that such a nation of squabbling tribes cannot endure in its present form for much longer.</p>
<p>Diversity has caused disunity and both are in the process of destroying this country.  It will only get worse.</p>

<p>Well, well, well, these epitomes of Latino high culture certainly demonstrate why we should let even more of them in here. Degenerate and foulmouthed, they absurdly scream about their &ldquo;freedom of speech&rdquo; while truculently assaulting the cameraman attempting to document, what they would like to see remain undocumented.</p>
<p>Quite curious, that?</p>
<p>This was a parade of anti-white hate, a demonstration of &ldquo;rich&rdquo; Latino diversity in all of its glory. Stupid chants and intimidation, entirely aimed at obtaining through forced &ldquo;cuteness&rdquo; and animalistic gluttony, that which is neither within the abilities of these &ldquo;demonstrators&rdquo; to achieve, or even less deserved by a tolerantly open and gifting white hand.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Up, up with immigration; down, down with deportation,&rdquo; indeed?</p>
<p>I am heartened that the American students openly combated these alien invaders and terrorists. I only wish that the campus and Lansing police forces had both had, as much guts as well. Then maybe, some real: education, registration, and documentation, would have been doled out on the Wells Hall Bridge? </p>
<p>After all, they stormed across the bridge, it didn&rsquo;t storm across them.</p>
<p>These are not our people, and when they so flagrantly wallow in exhibiting this fact and at our expense, they should be very strenuously reminded of that fact!</p>
<p>If not, God help us all in the future!</p>

			<p>Funny, the old time &#8216;Alta California, Nuevo Mexico and Texas&rsquo; territories never included lands as far north as Michigan, which today includes 11 distinct NATIVE AMERICAN (read: NOT Mestizo) tribes. Not one of these tribes are from as far south as Meso-Americans originate, therefore these &#8216;reconquista&rsquo; groups can go take a flying leap. Mexico owned the land after Spain gave it back for like a whoppin&rsquo; 15 years until the Mexicans ceded it away during their failed war with us in 1836. 15 years versus the 172 years in our possession since&hellip;thats 11 times the amount of time, and they have the gall to start this complaint now? I suppose with the increased security afforded by increased numbers of your own kind also increases your boldness.</p>
<p>These &#8216;reconquista&rsquo; groups have zero claims on any lands within the proper U.S. border today. There is another reason for this public display: The video clearly demonstrates this group&rsquo;s agitative propaganda which is meant to further incite Americans during such trying domestic times.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We didn&rsquo;t cross the border, the border crossed us.&#8221;</p>
<p>This may be a more effective argument if one lives in a border state, but I can&rsquo;t understand the logic of this slogan in Michigan.  Assuming they are students attending MSU, I&rsquo;d tend to believe Geography wasn&rsquo;t their strongest subject.</p>

<p>I watched the video - make sure you see it.  The foul mouthed female featured has created a Red Brigade Bolshevic styled fascist of herself.  And she probably doesn&rsquo;t see it at all.</p>

			<p>Maybe these &#8216;students&rsquo; are Canadian Mexican?  Maybe they came South and not North.  Canada was part of Aziltland before those evil Canadians stole the land from Mexico in the Canadian-Mexican War of 1936.</p>
<p>Remember when General Diaz left his wooden hand on the Plains of Abraham outside of Montreal, before the retreat of the Mexican Army to Halifax, where they boarded their ships and returned to Vera Cruz?  Famous battle&hellip;</p>

<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t anyone in the MSM pointed out the fact that this stolen from Malcolm X&rsquo;s &#8220;we didn&rsquo;t land on Plymouth Rock, Plymouth Rock landed on us&#8221;? Or have they?  I haven&rsquo;t noticed.</p>
<p>Dedalus posted something a few weeks ago that really stuck with me.  That Whites have degenerated by class, and since they were at the top of Western Civilization, The West is now deteriorating by Race. Maybe he got the idea from Neitzsche, who said in the 19th century that the Socialists were forcing the Working Class and Peasants (obviously White) onto Europe. He asked the simple question &#8220;Why?&#8221; and followed it by saying, &#8220;they&rsquo;re only going to keep on asking for more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today we think so much along racial lines, for obvious reasons, that we do tend to forget that the problem in the West all started in the 19th century among Whites. No one was even thinking about other races, it was inconceivable.  Well, now they are.</p>

			<p>The next AMREN story about the success of the mexican oil industry just about sums it up. It won&rsquo;t be long before china is asked to &#8216;help&rsquo; the mexicans. Now that should be fun, given the international support for running the olympic torch surrounded by chinese para-military crowd control &#8216;helpers&rsquo;. Better get used to re-fried rice! That chinese ship full of arms and ammunition which has failed to deliver it&rsquo;s cargo to zimbabwe is still on the high seas looking for a suitable off-load port. Let&rsquo;s see the hispanics demand ID from chinese oil workers&hellip;</p>

			<p>This is unreal. Things are becoming as bad in Michigan as in California. Worse? I don&rsquo;t think an incident like this has even happened on a college campus in California yet. The sense of entitlement, or whatever you&rsquo;d call it, of these hispanics in Michigan is weird, considering their 2000 miles from the Mexican border.</p>

<p>Ummmmm&hellip;. Certainly not in Michigan which you overran anyway.  The basic argument is that whites have no right to be anywhere yet all other minorities have the right to access to white areas and prosperity by quotas in them.</p>

			<p>And where was the police while all this was going on? As a whole, I found the video to be very disgusting. It clearly shows there isn&rsquo;t much intelligence in our colleges anymore. (if they were eve  students) This was quite evident by that nasty looking girls profanity laced statements. She wasn&rsquo;t even smart enough to demonstrate basic communication skills. She evidently never heard the axiom which states: &#8220;those that curse frequently use this tatic to cover their ignorance&#8221;.</p>

			<p>All I can say is, we need more college protests like this. These demonstrators are making it quite clear: they think the U.S./Mexican border is illegitimate. We need protests like this at every university in the land. Maybe then it would wake the American people up that this is not just about some friendly impoverished Mexicans wanting to make a better life for themselves in America, but about the returning of the land  &mdash;  our land  &mdash;  to what they consider to rightfully belong to the Hispanic race. Count on this NOT being mentioned in any upcoming presidential debates.</p>

			<p>You cannot reason with these people of their &#8220;adult&#8221; versions anywhere. A key thing to understand is that there is no reasoning with them there is only conceding defeat to these people. That is the option our establishment (elite bankers, corporate heads and media bosses) along with their allies in congress, the white house and the supreme court, those working to &#8220;globalize&#8221; and &#8220;internationalize&#8221; the United States, urge us to choose. They, the big money establishment elite, of course are very connected with the hispanic racial groups like MECHA (chicano student movement of aztlan, LULAC (league of united latin american citizens) and the ever wonderful MALDEF ( mexican american legal defense and education fund).  </p>

			<p>Wonderful, people who more then likely don&rsquo;t even belong on college campus but because of &#8220;diversity&#8221; are permitted to attend are spending their time with this kind of nonsense. I guess it hides the fact they probably do very poorly in the classroom.</p>

			<p>The empty can makes the most noise.  </p>
<p>This and other hispanic act outs are a fine example of what was said in the Colorado State House this week.  </p>
<p>For those who are still children intellectually, place a rock in an empty can as opposed to a can full of rocks.  ( few brains as apposed to many brains ).</p>
<p>Refer back to the first statement.  Flippe</p>

Where did that one White on Black crime occur? Was it some 15 year old spray painting the dreaded &#8220;N word&#8221; on a sidewalk. Are White students roving in gangs on Campus raping and murdering Black coeds? What a freakin&rsquo; joke. I attended Graduate School at Temple University in the early 70s. I was attacked in a subway station near the campus and had to fight my way out of danger. Several female students were raped and one law student was shot to death. It&rsquo;s even worse now. I have student who was accepted at Yale.  He returned from a visit to the campus today and was describing what a scary place New Haven is. <br>
Black on White crime indeed!! <br>

			<p>Excellent video, MSU-YAF!  The leftist &#8220;protesters&#8221; of today are so clueless, they end up strengthening their opposition.  I loved the young woman calling you (some kind of) &#8220;fascist&#8221; at the end of the clip.  Yikes, where&rsquo;s the love? ;)  I mean&hellip;.  *they* were the ones blocking the bridge.  A right-wing Michael Moore could not have done any better.  (Small point   &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t think the &#8220;Carmina Burana&#8221; in the background worked very well.  Might be better to skip the music entirely, IMHO.)</p>

			<p>What puzzles me about the foul-mouthed gal in the clip is that it was a *reporter* she was swearing at.  It seems to me that if you organize and participate in a public protest of any sort, you don&rsquo;t get to complain when the press shows up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure her parents are very proud of what they&rsquo;re getting in exchange for the tuition money they&rsquo;re spending on their little commissar wannabe.</p>
<p>I hope this sort of thing is repeated, as their own uncivil behavior harms their cause.</p>
