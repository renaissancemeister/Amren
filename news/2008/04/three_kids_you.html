			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pamela Paul, Washington Post, April 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>My husband and I are getting ready to do what many couples in these brink-of-recessionary times would consider unthinkable. No, we&rsquo;re not buying a Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard retreat or planning a month in St. Bart&rsquo;s or eco-decorating our house.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re planning to have a third child.</p>
<p>What shocks people, when we tell them, isn&rsquo;t the thought of hauling three kids onto a place for a vacation, or even the idea of coming home every night to a houseful of runny noses and homework assignments. What gets them is the sheer financial audacity. Raising kids today costs a fortune. Last month, the Department of Agriculture estimated that each American child costs an average of $204,060 to house, clothe, educate and entertain until the age of 18.</p>
<p>But to me, a family with just two kids seems minimalist, and even a bit sad. Back in the 1970s, when my husband and I were born, sprawling families were more common. My husband had two sisters and, following a Brady-Bunchy set of remarriages in my family, I wound up with seven brothers, real and step. I&rsquo;ve always fantasized about creating a &#8220;Meet Me in St. Louis&#8221;-style household of my own, with children constantly underfoot and enough relatives around to skip to my lou en masse.</p>
<p>And yet nowadays, people seem aghast if a couple wants more than two children. When Elana Sigall, a 43-year-old attorney in Brooklyn, was pregnant with her third, people came up to her constantly, she said, to admonish her: &#8220;You&rsquo;ve got a boy and a girl already. Why don&rsquo;t you just leave it alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse, the desire to have another child opens one up to charges of elitism and status consciousness. In many major U.S. cities and their suburbs &mdash; especially New York, where I live &mdash; having three or more children has now come to seem like an ostentatious display of good fortune, akin to owning a pied-Ãƒ -terre in Paris. The family of five has become &#8220;deluxe.&#8221; Last year, novelist Molly Jong-Fast mused in the New York Observer, &#8220;Are people having four or five children just because they can? Because they feel that it shows their wealth and status? In a world where the young rich use their $13,000 Birkin bags as diaper bags, one has to wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>We not only wonder, we marvel, we get jealous, we gawk. &#8220;Having three kids in the city is a way of showing off, absolutely,&#8221; says Elisabeth Egan, who, like many families she knows, moved out of New York to the suburbs of Montclair, N.J., to manage the feat. &#8220;A third child in the city is definitely a luxury good.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that it takes a lot more money to bring up baby nowadays. Many parents would scoff at the Agriculture Department&rsquo;s humble figures. When you get into the nitty-gritty, the price of kids feels more like a million dollars a pop.</p>
<p>Consider raising a single &#8220;luxury&#8221; child. By luxury, mind you, we&rsquo;re not necessarily talking hedge-fund rich, merely able to afford and &#8220;raise right.&#8221; And the pressure to do that, even if you&rsquo;re not uber-wealthy, has become overwhelming. From the moment the heartbeat blinks across the sonogram screen, Big Baby starts in with its pleading and conniving: I&rsquo;m your child! How can you spare any expense? Don&rsquo;t you care?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So parents quickly adjust to the demanding realities of the child-rearing industry. Baby showers have replaced bridal showers as the blowout du jour; American women today have an average of three. The accompanying baby registries have mushroomed into a $240 million business, according to research firm Mintel International Group. Between diapers and bouncy seats, parents can count on spending at least $6,500 on the first year of baby gear alone. &#8220;You walk into Babies R Us, and you&rsquo;re just overwhelmed,&#8221; recalls Brooke Houghton, a 35-year-old mom from Chicago who said she ran out of the store in panic after 15 minutes. &#8220;There was just so much equipment I hadn&rsquo;t even considered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once a new mom&rsquo;s maternity leave (if she&rsquo;s lucky enough to get it) is up, a nanny or quality day care is in order. {snip}</p>
<p>For parents who both work full-time &mdash; or those otherwise occupied with family, charitable and social obligations &mdash; child care doesn&rsquo;t end when the children enter school. If you calculate nanny pay on top of $26,000 annual private school tuition (eventually multiplied by three), you&rsquo;re talking $140,000 just to keep your children safe and reasonably occupied while the sun&rsquo;s up. Once children are a bit older, there&rsquo;s the battery of ballet, piano, squash (offbeat sports viewed as an inroad to Harvard), and the vehicles needed to get there. Hyper-vigilant child safety laws mean that up to the age of 7, children are boxed into full-size or booster car seats. Try jamming three of those into the back seat of a compact car.</p>
<p>Most families simply can&rsquo;t afford all this. {snip}</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s American children, by contrast, get an average of 70 new toys a year, yet child development experts agree that the best toys are simple playthings such as blocks, balls and figurines that a child can play with over and over, in new ways. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for my husband and me, we hardly have unlimited resources, but we&rsquo;re still planning to go forth and multiply in the big city. The way we figure it, one day our children will be grateful for what we didn&rsquo;t give them &mdash; and what we did for them instead.</p>
