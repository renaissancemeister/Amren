						<p>Los Angeles County sheriff&rsquo;s officials are investigating a riot that broke out Tuesday involving hundreds of immigration detainees at a county-run facility in Lancaster, where guards had to use tear gas grenades to restore order, authorities said today.</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Department contracts with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to house about 900 detainees awaiting deportation at the Mira Loma Detention Center, according to sheriff&rsquo;s spokesman Steve Whitmore.</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel spent much of the night interviewing detainee witnesses, and some who instigated the riot may be prosecuted on criminal charges, authorities said.</p>
<p>ICE officials plan to send a review team to Mira Loma this week to conduct an in-depth inquiry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s riot started as a morning fight between two detainees from rival gangs, then escalated by 1:30 p.m. into a &ldquo;melee&rdquo; in the detention center&rsquo;s outdoor yard, Kice and Whitmore said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mira Loma guards routinely separate detainees based on gang affiliation, and that process will be evaluated as part of the sheriff&rsquo;s investigation into the riot, Whitmore said. Gang leaders, or &ldquo;shot callers,&rdquo; inside the facility can be placed in isolation, in different cell blocks or moved to other facilities, he said.</p>
<p>Already, 50 detainees involved in Tuesday&rsquo;s riot have been identified as gang members and bused to other federal facilities, he said this morning. Whitmore would not say what gangs those detainees were affiliated with or which gangs were involved in the riot.</p>

					<p>The gangs have spilled out of the detention centers, too  &mdash;   Los Angeles is now basically a Latino gangland city, with each gang carving up its stretch of turf.  Added to the general crime and vandalism of the place, it&rsquo;s caused a level of white flight probably unprecedented in US history.</p>
<p>I keep running into more and more white families, my old and current friends, who are not just leaving the state but leaving the <span class="caps">USA </span>in general.  Probably the highest percentage occurs among white families in California and Arizona, where the demographic replacement has been most advanced.  Not something I ever dreamed of 10 years ago, but it&rsquo;s happening to a shocking degree.  I only found out about this because a fellow in my neighborhood has left for Chile with his wife and 4 children, and when I started asking about it, I realized this is much more common than I ever imagined.  A lot of people have German (or Germanic) or Italian ancestry, which gives them some privileges to immigrate to Italy or a central European country like Austria, Germany, Denmark or Finland once they learn a bit of the language.  But a lot of Americans are heading to South America, chiefly to Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, which have a white (non-mestizo) population and in fact, are among the most European countries still remaining on the planet.  (Nobody wants to go the <span class="caps">UK,</span> Canada or Australia, which are encountering the same demographic disasters as the <span class="caps">USA </span>is.)</p>
<p>Again, a simple message  &mdash;   white families want to raise their children in places where the demographic and social make-up approximates their own.  When this fabric is destroyed, as is systematically occurring throughout the <span class="caps">USA,</span> Canada, UK and Australia, then we go elsewhere to raise our families.</p>

					<p>Simple solution to all this: end illegal immigration and reset immigration quotas back to pre 1962 levels. Problem solved.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;Los Angeles County sheriff&rsquo;s officials are investigating a riot that broke out Tuesday involving hundreds of immigration detainees at a county-run facility in Lancaster, where guards had to use tear gas grenades to restore order, authorities said today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bunch of illegal alien gang members riot and tear gas grenades are used to &ldquo;restore order?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They should have use the good old fashion kind of grenades, the ones that simply explode, and make salsa and taco salad out of rioting Latino gang bangers. Add a dash of machinegun fire to spice things up a bit, and order would be restored for good. </p>
<p>That, or they simply should have let the two sides fight it out until one half had slaughtered the other, and then gunned the victors down while they strutted about the prison yard as if they owned it.</p>
<p>Then that would be the end of that, adios amigos!<br>

					<p>In the early 1800s, there was a riot in a prison near Washington <span class="caps">D.C. </span> 30 Marines, led by the Commandant of the Marine Corps in person, stopped the riot.  They lined up, fixed bayonets, and gave the prisoners 5 minutes to return to their cells.  The 300 rioters, knowing that after the first musket volley they could swarm over the Marines, sneered and bellowed, for about 4 minutes and 30 seconds.  Then, realizing that the Marines were not bluffing and were intent on killing as many of them as possible, they made a mad scramble in the last seconds.  No lives were lost, probably to the disappointment of the Commandant.  Given the power of modern weapons, 3 men could easily do the same today, with little risk of being overrun.  All it takes is will. </p>

					<p>Let us not forget our national leaders who strove so faithfully to continue the illegal importation of hundreds of thousands of these soulless thugs - President George W. Bush and would-be President, Senator John (&#8220;that damn border fence&#8221;) McCain - and of course those two esteemed Democrat Senators, Barak Obama and Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Once again, our two-party system provides the voters with all the choices a corporate roundtable could want.  </p>

					<p>Recently I watched a documentary on the gang <span class="caps">MS13, </span>and it said that when the US mass deported thousands of gang memebers back to El Salvaldor etc, all that happened was the &#8216;francise&rsquo; expanded and made the whole gang more powerful globally. It seems you can&rsquo;t win. </p>
<p>Another thing I don&rsquo;t get. <br>
A minority group bands together to fight the perceived majority whites(little do they know that us whites don&rsquo;t see ourselves as a group) or the establishment/whatever, then when they become the majority(in their area) they fight each other in small tribal battles over turf etc.<br><br>
What&rsquo;s the point.</p>
