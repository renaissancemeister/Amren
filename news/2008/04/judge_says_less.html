<p>Late Monday afternoon and early Tuesday morning, jurors heard graphic testimony from Knox County Acting Medical Examiner Dr. Darinka Mileusnic-Polchan about the deaths of Newsom and Christian.</p>
<p>She told jurors that Newsom was repeatedly raped and then blindfolded, gagged, arms and feet bound and his head covered. Barefoot, he was either led or dragged outside the house to a set of nearby railroad tracks, where a gun was placed to the back of his head and fired. He was shot twice more, once in the neck and once in the back. His body was then set afire, she said.</p>
<p>Christian&rsquo;s death would come only after hours of sexual torture, Mileusnic-Polchan testified.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Christian suffered horrific injuries to her vagina, anus and mouth. She was not only raped but savaged with &#8220;an object,&#8221; the doctor testified. She was beaten in the head. Some type of chemical was poured down her throat, and her body, including her bleeding and battered genital area, likely scrubbed with the same solution &mdash; all while Christian was alive, the forensic expert said.</p>
<p>She was then &#8220;hog-tied,&#8221; with curtains and strips of bedding, her face covered tightly with a small white trash bag and her body stashed inside five large trash bags before being placed inside a large trash can and covered with sheets, Mileusnic-Polchan testified.</p>
<p>Christian died slowly, suffocating, the medical examiner said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My conclusion was she actually died in the trash can,&#8221; Mileusnic-Polchan testified.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>The truly disgusting aspect of this verdict is that Knoxville blacks are now holding a &#8220;vigil&#8221; for Boyd.</p>
<p>Boyd&rsquo;s borrowed Toyota was seen at the house while the rapes were going on, so it seems fairly likely he could also be charged directly in the murders.</p>

<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t a hate crime we are told, race had nothing to do with it?</p>
<p>Nope, these blacks were just playing out their version of the film &ldquo;Hostel.&rdquo; Since (because they are oppressed by &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo;) they didn&rsquo;t have the money to purchase a white to torture and kill, they went one better here; they kidnapped two of them, sexually assaulted them first, and then tortured them to death.</p>
<p>Of course, we should all vote for Comrade Obama and racially heal away this type of inequality, through our audacious &ldquo;hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then no more imagined Duke &ldquo;Rape&rdquo; cases, or real live horrors such as this atrocity, right?</p>
<p>I am so disgusted by how little coverage this has gotten in the media, and how when it has, the racial hatred clearly involved has been all but laughed at, I could just vomit!</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were only out to rob them and steal their car&hellip;and then things just got out of hand&hellip;blah, blah, blah&hellip;</p>

			<p>I was watching a movie last year ( old one ) about two white guys raping and murdering a young black girl in Mississippi.When the movie was over I went on line to find out the facts of the case. What I found was that the whole story was total fiction, it just plain didn&rsquo;t happen, none of it. </p>
<p>My point is this, if they can show such a racially charged movie on network TV then why can&rsquo;t they come out in the open when real crimes take place. Real rapes and murders. Black people at their finest instead of showing things that never happened.  </p>

			<p>Another case of Obama&rsquo;s hatred of White People comes out again in the Black Community.  The hatred of America&rsquo;s White Middle Class is also taking place at the Latter Day Saints Ranch in Texas where the police, FBI, and sheriff&rsquo;s departments were prepared to kill everyone if there was any resistance.  They were going to open fire on White Women and children.  </p>

			<p>Now the leftist dregs at the Knoxville rag have wised up and are decrying the brutality of the torture-murders, something they didn&rsquo;t feel compelled to do when the story first came out.  Obviously the tremendous volume of mail on this has forced them to speak out against this vicious crime, but notice that they are so thoroughly brainwashed they still won&rsquo;t admit that such brutality would never have occurred if the victims had been non-white, and if they had been black, more likely than not, the crime would not have occurred at all.</p>
<p>Black on white assaults and killings occur with regularity.  And they do so to a great extent because of the many, many Reverend Jeremiah Wrights in this country, preaching evil and hate against whites, along with leftist radicals refusing to highlight these crimes as hate crimes and condemning them when they happen.  A typical example is this yellow journalistic rag that is reporting on it and the mind-numbed, brainwashed liberal who is authoring the events. </p>
<p>Bill O&rsquo;Reilly made a poignant point the other evening.  He said, more disturbing than this reverend Wright&rsquo;s despicable hate-filled rants is the response by the people who are listening to it.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll say that more disturbing than that even is the failure of the MSM to give vicious black on white crimes the same publicity they give to the far fewer, less brutal white on black incidents.  </p>

   The key word here was &#8220;ounce of humanity&#8221; very few of these criminal types have any at all and they know that a conviction is unlikely. If they are convicted, their time in jail wil be short and fun with all of the available amenities there are now for inmates and if they get the death penalty (very unlikely) it would just mean another 20 or more years of catered life in a nice cell with waiters (I mean corrections officers) and conjugal visits.

			<p>Can you all imagine the hell, the agony, the suffering these to white people had to endure before they were murdered? Can you hear their cries for help? Their pleading and begging for mercy, all in vain. A script to a &#8220;B&#8221; horror movie could not have come up with this type of depravity. Have you thought of what was going through Channon&rsquo;s mind as those black thugs placed that bag over her head? Or how Chris felt when he was being raped and then led blindfolded to his place of execution? Do you actually think that racial slurs were not screamed at these to innocent white people as they were being tortured? That Channon was not being called a &#8220;honky ho&#8221;as they raped her. The MSM makes me want to puke the way they ignore this crime, and if they do mention it, they downplay the racial aspect of it. What really infuriates me, is that white woman, D. Sutton, was screwing one of the black perps even when she had a hunch he was involved in the murders. Go to the Myspace web site sometime and read the profiles of some of the white girls. They all talk in black slang, worship the black thug culture, and when it comes to music, it is rap, hip-hop, and r&b.; This crime should be required reading in every college diversity course. </p>

			<p>Has anyone else notived the chronology here? The animals bound the girl, and then forced her to watch as they gang raped her boyfriend. Does this suggest that they are mostly homosexual by nature, or bisexual, or that they make no distinction between man and woman, or that they developed certain habits while they were doing time some place? </p>
<p>Were there narcotics involved? Were they dusted or loaded, or are they part of the generation of black children born addicted to crack? Is this what they are by nature - brutal and merciless and unconcerned by the needs of any but themselves?</p>
<p>And how stupid do you have to be to dump a body within sight of the place where you committed murder? How dumb must you be to believe you can conceal a dead body in a garbage can left behind the hovel you call home, believing no one will notice it when the trash is collected. How short sighted and ignorant are people who can be this brutal and think it won&rsquo;t catch up to them?</p>
<p>This should be the event used to rally those tough enough to disbelieve the lies we are told about equality. </p>

<p>Ironically, I have read that Christian&rsquo;s father is a shooter, and she had learned to handle firearms. Sadly, she was too young to be able to legally defend herself from these beasts with a firearm.</p>

Do you think she (they) would be any better than Obama? The &#8220;other&#8221; candidate &#8220;conservative&#8221; John (bombembacktostonehenge)McCain has already shown his true colors through his absolutely treasonous support of illegal aliens and his contempt for any kind of immigration control. So, NONE of the candidates would lift a finger to change anything concerning the rights and protections of White Americans. America had its one chance with Ron Paul and BLEW IT!

			<p>Daniel: Glad that you mentioned the movie about two whiteys raping the black girl. The film industry has been for at least two generations been producing this totally ficticious anti white propaganda because whites will not complain about it, and it makes them a lot of $ for them. If all of this propaganda causes scores of black on white hate crimes, they dont care, just as lond as it makes a profit for them.What I sorely hope for is that one of their children will be one of the many victims that they are creating.</p>

			<p>Actually, 8:28 AM, poor Channon was 21, and so legally able to buy a pistol and apply for a concealed-carry permit.  Unfortunately, the first rule of using a firearm to defend yourself is &#8220;Have your gun with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guns are like fire-extinguishers; you will probably never actually need one, but when you do, nothing else will suffice.</p>
<p>Of course, if Christian or Newsome *had* shot a few of their attackers while the crime still looked like a carjacking, the same MSM that ignored the grotesque torments they endured would have denounced the shooting as an &#8220;overreaction&#8221;.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m (almost) speachless.  White women screaming &#8220;We need Obama&#8221; in connection with one of the most brutal crimes of recent years?  If this happens again, definitely try to get it on video of some kind.  It&rsquo;s almost beyond belief.  (P.S.   &mdash;   This might sound corny, but I want to thank you for protesting.  Someone really does have to be present to witness the kind of insanity you reported on.)</p>

			<p>There was a rally in Knoxville for these two innocents last year.  Rally info was posted here on AMREN and many, many other places on the web.  Way less than 100 showed up.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You think this is bad? Wait until whites are a minority. Such crimes will be everyday, done with impunity, and so much as a peep will be branded &ldquo;racism&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yup, and there is even a real live case study of what is going to happen to you too. Come to South Africa and see (and experience) it for yourselves.</p>

<p>These shrews are obviously suffering from an advanced case of Stockholm Syndrome. They are volunteering to be a hot lunch. Media indoctrination? Liberation Theology? Paresis? Demonic possession? Or Fluoridated water? There has to be an explanation.</p>

			<p>If Christian or Newsome had shot a few of their attackers while the crime still looked like a carjacking, the same MSM that ignored the grotesque torments they endured would have denounced the shooting as an &ldquo;overreaction&rdquo;.<br>

<p>ABSOLUTELY 100% CORRECT!  Your prediction reminds me of Bernard Goetz and the choice he was forced to make at the hands of four young, black thugs.  The media hammered the poor guy as having overreacted.  Had Channon or Christopher successfully defended themselves against these sub-humans, they would have been crucified in the MSM as hateful bigots that misinterpreted the saintly intentions of these alterboys.  When it comes to the MSM, they just can&rsquo;t let facts get in the way of a good &#8220;white-on-black hate crime&#8221; story. See Jena, La. for further proof of this tactic.</p>

			<p>Hey Talanl, thanks for your comment. Could you tell us where you held the protest? Was it in front of the courthouse? Did you need to get some sort of a permit? And how many supporters did you have with you? Also, how do these white counter-protesters, especially the white women, explain this crime? How do they rationalize it? Do they think these black thugs are being &#8220;railroaded&#8221;?</p>

			<p>larry k, you don&rsquo;t realize apparently,the extent to which the Main Stream Media,television, the school system and the movies of Hollywood, have stupidfied large sections of the American public. There are millions of people who live in such a state of delusion, they cannot even judge what is or isn&rsquo;t real anymore. Their judgement on even serious matters, such as crime, has  been totally impaired. </p>

			<p>it does not matter if you are not enemies with them, they are enemies with you. the race war started years ago, but is covered up by the media. if not for the internet, this case would be unknown outside of the knoxville area. false accusations of rape by blacks against whites are national news.</p>

<p>This comment may have been meant as irony or sarcasm, but, unfortunately, it seems to be all to true.  Apparently, according to the mainstream media, a person is supposed to first submit to gang rape, beatings, torture, etc. before fighting back.  To not do so might offend the perpetrator(s).</p>

			<p>&#8220;I was watching a movie last year &hellip; about two white guys raping and murdering a young black girl in Mississippi.When the movie was over I went on line to find out the facts of the case. What I found was that the whole story was total fiction, it just plain didn&rsquo;t happen, none of it.&#8221; <br>

<p>The movie in question is &#8220;A Time to Kill&#8221; based on fictional novel of John Grisham. This movie also endorses vigilante lynchings of whites by blacks.</p>
<p>Imagine a movie in which two black males menacingly drive along side a frightened young white girl, whom they kidnap, brutally gang rape, and torture.  Imagine that later in this movie white vigilantes &ldquo;lynch&rdquo; the accused black men.  Imagine that these white vigilantes and the lawyer who defends them are the heroes of this movie.<br>
Do you suppose such a movie would receive the gushing praise from the liberal media that the movie &ldquo;A Time to Kill&rdquo; has received?<br>
It won&rsquo;t bother multimillionaire left-wing author John Grisham, as he enjoys the six million dollar advance he received for this movie, if it inspires the same kind of racial violence as other such inflammatory left-wing race-baiting:  In Kenosha, Wisconsin, after viewing &ldquo;Mississippi Burning&rdquo; and discussing the completely fictional scene showing whites viciously beating a praying black youth, a group of blacks beat a passing white youth into a coma.<br>
Perhaps instead of yet another movie depicting the fantasy world according to the Left, some movies about recent true incidents could be made:  Such as the story of a young white girl, Ann Harrison, who, while waiting for a school bus in front of her Kansas City home, was kidnapped by two black men cruising through her neighborhood, and by whom she was gang raped, tortured, and knifed to death, her mutilated body left in the trunk of a stolen car.<br>
Or perhaps another FACT based movie about the 12 year old Japanese school girl walking to school who was kidnapped and gang-raped by 3 BLACK U.S. servicemen.</p>
<p>We will never have racial peace in this country.  The Left will see to that.<br>

<p>Another thing that movie did was the peddle the fiction that that white-sheet organization is still huge, (esp. in Mississippi), and can be turned &#8220;on&#8221; with simple provocation to the point where they rally in force in front of a courthouse.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Some type of chemical was poured down her throat..&#8221;<br>
Very reminiscent of another black on white racial atrocity: The HI-FI Horror:<br>
You can have a place with even a MINISCULE black population, and with sickening regularity, some atrocity takes place, and it is a black who did it. Either one from the area or often one who came in. <br>
In Ogden, in Northern Utah, the black population is nil, even today. In 1974 it was even less. One of the safest areas you could find for you and your family. You think especially you would be safe from the black on non-black racial atrocities that are part of daily life in areas with or near substantial black populations. But even in 1970&rsquo;s Northern Utah, with almost no black presence, you STILL could not escape the horrific consequences of unbridled black racist hate. And, like so many other innumerable acts of black on non-black atrocities (Zebra Killings, Liberty City Riot Mutilation Killings, Wichita Massacre, Yahweh Ben Yahweh Cult Mutilation Killings, Knoxville Horror, Tifton Georgia Massacres, Long Island Commuter Train Massacre,&hellip;.) the HI-FI Massacre has been relegated to the Memory Hole. <br>
Two black males took 5 white strangers prisoner. They viciously and repeatedly raped a young white girl among the captives. They tortured and murdered them in the most unspeakable fashion, by forcing them to drink Drano, which burns the white victims&rsquo; insides alive in the most horrific excruciating deaths imaginable. One survivor they rammed a pen through his ear into his brain. <br>
The NAACP went into action ON BEHALF OF THESE SADISTIC DEPRAVED BLACK RACIST  KILLERS!!!!<br>

<p>Excellent point: Another example of how reality is EXACTLY INVERTED: Time and again it is BLACK RACIST organizations that &#8220;rally in force in front of a courthouse&#8221; demanding blacks who&rsquo;ve committed some atrocity against a white be freed: We saw this in the Central Park Jogger case, the OJ case, the Reginald Denny case, the Jena case,&hellip;.<br>
And we likewise see these BLACK RACIST organizations &#8220;rally in force in front of a courthouse&#8221; trying to railroad innocent whites such as during the Duke Lacrosse rape hoax, the Tawana Brawley hoax, and innumerable cases of white law-enforcement officers who defended themselves from an attacking black suspect or who were doing their jobs and were railroaded by threatening black lynch mobs.</p>

			<p>I also recall the &#8220;Hi-Fi&#8221; murders. A book was written about this case, and details the hell these people were put through by those two black thugs. Both the black killers were in the Air Force and stationed near Ogden, Utah. Both those black thugs were executed after years of appeals, and they went to their deaths like a couple of cowards. And yes the NAACP and various white liberals tried to save them. No mention was ever made of a hate crime. </p>

			<p>     As whites who fear for the lives of our children and ourselves we must boycott the media that promote lies. The liberal media is our enemy. It&rsquo;s plain and simple; hit &#8216;em where it hurts.We must learn to do without that morning paper. No exceptions. Then we will target the advertisers. Some must be boycotted. Finally we need a la carte cable. This way anti-white television stations will for the most part fall into the dustbin of history. Believe me it all starts with the media. Crush this lying phony media or it will crush us. God bless the memory of Shannon and Christian.</p>

<p>   Exactly. If people in 1870 for example could do without television and were much happier why can&rsquo;t we? </p>
<p>   As it is written in an article named &lsquo;A Call to Action: Secede&rsquo; by Yggdrasil<br>
&ldquo;Those of you who have jobs should cancel your cable subscriptions. You pay $400 a year for basic service and you get garbage. Why bother? If you have children, they will be much better off without TV. They will read, raise their SAT scores, and interact with friends rather than becoming couch potato losers to the consumerist fantasy served up to them by Hollywood. Instead, rent videos so YOU control what you watch!&rdquo;</p>
