						<p>In Mexico, the story of the country&rsquo;s black population has been largely ignored in favor of an ideology that declares that all Mexicans are &#8220;mixed race.&#8221; But it&rsquo;s the mixture of indigenous and European heritage that most Mexicans embrace; the African legacy is overlooked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What they are not saying is that in ordinary life in Mexico, lighter-skinned Mexicans are accepted and have first place,&#8221; [said Padre Glyn Jemmott, a Roman Catholic priest from Trinidad and Tobago who has had a parish of a dozen Costa Chican pueblos since 1984.]</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Cuajinicuilapa, in the state of Guerrero, there&rsquo;s a small museum dedicated to telling the story of the black presence in Mexico.</p>
<p>But Costa Chicans often say they learned little in school about how blacks came to live on the coast, little about the history of slavery &mdash; only myths passed down over generations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They were not taught the details of their history: that Spanish slavers took Africans to colonial Mexico (New Spain) in the 16th century, long before the first slaves arrived in Jamestown, Va.; that during the colonial period there were more Africans than Europeans in Mexico.</p>
<p>The Costa Chicans were also not taught that some of the blacks were not slaves; that blacks lived throughout what is now Mexico, working in mining, sugar plantations and fishing.</p>
<p>In some instances black Mexicans were explorers and co-founders of settlements, including Los Angeles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the California African American Museum in Exposition Park opened a major traveling exhibition, &#8220;The African Presence in Mexico,&#8221; detailing the contribution of Africans to Mexican history and culture.</p>

					<p>I doubt mestizo&rsquo;s will care about &#8220;African&#8221; contributions to Mexico. It seems that the more successful a Mexican is the more they are attracted to Whites(European culture). That goes for Hispanic men and women.</p>

					<p>I see curly haired Mexicans, darker than typical, and it&rsquo;s obvious that they have some African genes, but I suspect that it&rsquo;s a taboo topic.  Mexico would no more celebrate Black History Hour than Korea would celebrate Comfort Girl Week.  </p>

					<p>In reality, this is nothing more than a puff piece by the pro-black LA Times to get it&rsquo;s Mexican readers to believe that they have a &#8220;natural kinship&#8221; with blacks.</p>
<p>The LA Times did the same thing a few years back, but their target was Whites. They tried to claim (falsely) that blacks had been a part of European society since there was a &#8220;Europe&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all really pathetic and emblematic of a larger problem in society: Whole populations of people cannot stand the culture of blacks and want separation from them, but we have this pro-black media haggling us about it and desparately trying to make us believe we are connected with them, when we aren&rsquo;t. </p>

					<p>Most Latin Americans are extremely conscious of race and skin color. When I was a university student in Peru I had a girlfriend who seemed quite dark, but was always going on about how European she was compared to the &#8220;cholos&#8221;, as they call the mestizos.</p>
<p>This got so tiresome that I commented once to her in front of a group that as far as I was concerned <span class="caps">ALL </span>of them were cholos. Oh! The pain; the insult!</p>
<p>Not a nice thing of me to say, but I was just fed up after a day of university lectures focusing on the evils of the white man. If we&rsquo;re so bad, why do they judge their own worth by how closely they resemble us?!</p>

					<p>  I think Diego Rivera has a mural celebrating the founding of the Mexican race.  As I recall, the black contribution is conspicuously absent. It seems like even Mexican intellectuals are not happy with the increased diversity. By the way, if you want to start a quick fight with a working class Chicano, say he has black ancestors.  </p>

<p>The answer is that mestizos and indigenous Americans, north and south have a cutlural habit of making up myths and then a little later offering them as facts.  The contradictions of their very existence is such that blatant self-evident logic defying explanations such as you experienced are common.  There is little foundation in the groups that were converted very quickly to Catholicism in the colonial period.  The priests gave them Spanish surnames and a nonsensical explanation of who they were.  The effect of this and deeper cultural effects of pre-conquest superstitions and nonsensical cosmologies are the cause of this.  Of course, they are encouraged by the modern political pressure to justify themselves in whatever is convenient for them.</p>
<p>This is a can of worms that will never be sorted out.</p>

					<p>I know for a fact that Mexicans do not like to talk about the fact that they have a lot of black blood in them.  They will instead tell you that they are a mixture of all races due to their general openness to immigration over the years- which is bunk of course.  </p>

					<p>They have about 3-5% Black genes on average in Mexico, but in the US it&rsquo;s only about 1% Black genes. But in some provinces, like Guerrero, it is a lot higher. If you ask a smart Mexican, he will tell that that they bred the Black genes out and they have completely disappeared. Doesn&rsquo;t work that way. And yes, you do see some Mexicans that have some Black in them, obviously. There is also a possibility that the Mexicans in the US are on avearge Whiter than those in Mexico too.</p>

That is exactly true!   I once had a very good Mexican friend who told me that if you want to really insult somebody, the very worst thing you can say is,  &#8220;By the way,  tell me, which one in your family is black?&#8221;</p>

It&rsquo;s called cognitive dissonance!    It shows that the propaganda isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
