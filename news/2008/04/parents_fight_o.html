						<p>A couple fighting about which gang their 4-year-old toddler should join caused a public disturbance that resulted in the father&rsquo;s arrest, Commerce City police said Thursday.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Joseph Manzanares stormed into the Hollywood Video store where his girlfriend worked, threatened to kill her and knocked over several video displays and even a computer, Commerce City police Sgt. Joe Sandoval said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His girlfriend told police that they had been arguing about the upbringing of their son and which gang he should belong to. The teen mother, who is black, is a member of the Crips. Manzanares is Hispanic and belongs to the Westside Ballers gang, the woman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have different ideas on how the baby should be raised. Basically, she said they cannot agree on which gang the baby would &lsquo;claim,&rsquo;&#8221; Sandoval said.</p>

			<p>Nothing about the kid being rescued by DFS/CPS? In spite of the fact that both his father and mother are self-admitted gang members, and admit they want their son to join a gang. If the kid wanted to join the gang, and the parents would have spanked him for doing so, to dissuade him perpetually from that notion, DFS/CPS would have swooped in like ducks on a june bug. If these two wanted to adopt a baby, their application would become a perennial joke among adoptive services professionals. Maybe the only hope for the kid having a stable upbringing is if the Crips and the Westside Ballers merge.</p>
<p>Note that the kid is 4 and daddy is 19, do the math. No telling how old mama is.  This is a side effect of procreating at 15.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s perfectly understandable.  When the kid is about 15 and knifes his first victim, just think of how embarrassing it would be for one of the parents who is in the Mexican Mafia to find out that the Brown Berets got credit for the assault instead of the Mexican Mafia.</p>
<p>Whites just don&rsquo;t understand the importance and pride involved in this sort of thing.</p>

			<p>Well, as a white, I am a little startled. I did not think miscregnation would lead to such difficult life decisions. </p>
<p>Asian parents and Jewish parents have to decide which is the best temple, Christian parents which is the best church, and now Hispanic and Blacks have to decide which is the best criminal gang.<br/>
 <br/>
If I were a Liberal, I really wouldn&rsquo;t be able to say which they should choose, it&rsquo;s so difficult and Liberals don&rsquo;t want to be judgemental, so a Liberal would suggest counseling to help reach a consensus.</p>
<p>Being a Conservative White, I suggest following English tradition, the man&rsquo;s family should have the advantage.</p>
<p>Go Westside Ballers!</p>

Perhaps this is the ghetto equivalent of a white couple arguing over which preschool the child should attend. </p>
<p>In this situation, the parents probably DO have a very realistic picture of what will happen to their son as he grows older.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about sane people here; we&rsquo;re talking about minority (in this case Mexican) gangbangers. Of course, if one wants to get all Clintonian, it depends on what the meaning of &#8220;sane&#8221; is.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d hold out for the gang that can offer an attractive signing bonus and dental plan, maybe even a 401K.  One thing&rsquo;s for sure; it pays to shop around before signing a Letter of Intent.</p>

			<p>I repeat what I have said before many times, the average American citizen deserves all of the negatives that illegal immigration is going to give them in life, because they will not lift a finger to stop it. Millions are clueless and unconcerned, and I just read today that illegal immigration has once again become a non-issue for the three useless people running for the Presidency. It isn&rsquo;t their fault, it&rsquo;s ours and those &#8220;Americans&#8221; who fight those few who are trying to stop it.</p>

			<p>Some idiot in a wifebeater T-shirt, saggy pants, and the required backward baseball cap had a card table in front of the local supermarket. It had a sign that said &#8220;Prevent Gang Crime!&#8221; and a donation box. I walked by, and the little %?$! actually asked me to donate. (Who else walks around with hair as short as mine, but an off-duty cop? The guy&rsquo;s not even a good gan member.) </p>
<p>I told him that I do my part to prevent gang violence and crime by locking up as many of the little <i>scheissen</i> as I could catch, and that I&rsquo;d be f  &mdash;    &mdash;  -d if I&rsquo;d give him any money. Judging by the look on his face, I&rsquo;d say that was rather less cordial than he was used to.</p>
<p>This is only vaguely related to the posted story, but I thought others might find it inspirational.</p>

			<p>Many centuries ago, a wise King judged that a child be cut in two, and half be given to each of those claiming the sole right to the infant. How about half to each gang leader? Perhaps a similar, but less drastic solution could be put to these two &#8216;adults&rsquo; as only one can claim support benefit, that is until the next aspiring gang member arrives.</p>

			<p>Perhaps the most depressing part of this article (and there are many to choose from) is how it&rsquo;s a symptom of the decline of even Colorado within the US Southwest.  California, Arizona and New Mexico have long been going down the drain  &mdash;   all 3 are basically Latino-majority, especially in the schools, and drugs, gangs and crime have been proliferating.  It seems that I can&rsquo;t even visit California or Arizona anymore, without meeting a frustrated White family leaving for another state  &mdash;   or in a few cases, leaving the country altogether.  It&rsquo;s not like this gets better with more generations  &mdash;   if anything, third- and fourth-generation Latinos have even higher rates of gang participation and crime than earlier generations.</p>
<p>But Colorado, for a time, seemed to be the exception.  Unfortunately, it too seems besieged by the same demographic wave that has all but ruined California and Arizona as a part of Western civilization.  Articles like this, sadly, will probably become increasingly common, and unless our immigration policy changes immediately  &mdash;   shutting down most legal immigration, as well as illegal  &mdash;   then our country is doomed overall.</p>

			<p>Simple solution.  Let the kid visit all the gangs and then he can make an &#8220;intelligent&#8221; decision as to which to join!  But, seriously, the people of Colorado should demand action to shut down all gangs.</p>

			<p>As a Coloradan, stories like this from the state&rsquo;s favorite &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; city remind me all over again why I have long considered Denver as a place to get through on the way between home in Colorado Springs and family in Boulder, and not a place to deliberately visit for its own sake.</p>

			<p>Maybe another taxpayer funded baby would allow them to asign one child to each gang.  Maybe they&rsquo;d face off against each other in some future terf war! So many possibilities.  </p>
<p>America is a great tolerant country, anything goes (Hell, we Fund It!).  No wonder the third world is so desperate to come here.</p>

			<p>We drove up to Boulder this last weekend to spend my birthday with my mother.  I do not generally watch broadcast TV, but my mother watches the news and a few other things, so of course it was on.  The local news always includes Denver.  The items included several fatal shootings by diversitoids and two homeless drug addicts who OD&rsquo;d/succumbed to hypothermia in a public park, all in the glittering multicultural paradise officially known as Denver, but which we call &#8220;Tijuana on Cherry Creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>To give AmRenners unfamiliar with Denver a clearer concept of how the city leaders think, some years ago there was a proposal to raise the minimum wage to ten dollars per hour within the city and county of Denver.  That this would simply have driven every restaurant and retail store out of Denver and into the surrounding suburbs did not initially seem to bother them.</p>

			<p>You have no idea what it is like to have grown up in Los Angeles for 40 years. The place went from a nice euro-centric pasturial and manufacturing center to all hell.</p>
<p>Gone are the dairy farms, orchards, fields, cheap land, and plentiful well paying blue collar jobs and in their place are hundreds of miles of concrete jungle held down by roving bands of Latino gangs preaching a La Raza political ideology (which the Latino teachers, paid for by our tax dollars, propigate) riddled with falsehoods. </p>
<p>The few colonial Dutch and German houses still housing those aging white Americans that built this state are surrounded by high barbed wire fences in the middle of gang ridden ghettos which used to be fields while their cities which used to be flush now try to figure out how to deal with mounting deficits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unsustainable.</p>
