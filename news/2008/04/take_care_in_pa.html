						<p>Sweden has urged its young women not to go out alone in Paris at night after a Swedish teenager was abducted and murdered in the French capital.</p>
<p>The charred body of Sussanna Zetterberg, 19, was discovered on Saturday in woods outside Paris just hours after she left a nightclub in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in a taxi, the driver is odd,&rdquo; Zetterberg said in a text message to a friend. She was not heard from again.</p>
<p>A postmortem showed she had been stabbed, a judicial source said. French press reported she had also been shot four times and was found with her hands tied behind her back.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are investigating whether there are any links with a case in February when another 19-year-old Swede was raped by a man who had posed as a taxi driver.</p>
<p>The Swedish embassy said on Thursday it had issued a warning to Swedish women via its national press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be too careful down here. You shouldn&rsquo;t be out alone at night and moving about the city. You need to make sure to stay in groups and take every possible precaution,&rdquo; Swedish ambassador to France, Gunnar Lund, was quoted as saying in the Swedish press.<br>

These types of crimes also happen in Mexico. Living in a border state with Canada, Canadian television (unlike American television) does stories on young women who are murdered during spring break trips to Mexico. The follow up of the story is how the family can&rsquo;t get any answers or help from the Mexican police or government.</p>

			<p>I am very sorry to hear this, but Scandinavians seem to never learn.  They, like many Europeans refuse to take precautions because it would be admitting that they must fear non-whites and that would be racist.</p>

			<p>If the makeup of taxi drivers in Paris is anything like it is here in Toronto, I would bet my bottom dollar the &#8220;odd&#8221; taxi driver was a non-White, probably a muslim.</p>

			<p>Since the Swedes are suddenly concerned about the well-being of their women, how about they close their borders to keep these 3rd World predators out?</p>

			<p>What a shame. Paris used to be a nice city to enjoy at night. One could go anywhere in the heart of the city at any hour and be safe. The suburbs have always been another matter, but the city itself was safe. How sad. Surely it&rsquo;s not the REAL French people who are doing this.</p>

			<p>We have a lot of this in London. Red Ken Livingstone made an advert showing a white woman being driven off by a bogus mini-cab driver. She also texts a message to a friend. (These are not the black cabbies London is famous for. They are not known at all for this type of thing) At the end of the ad we can just about make out that the driver is white. Needless to say, 99% of these assaults are carried by Muslims/Africans etc.</p>
<p>PS. A native englishman with a criminal record for sexual assault has just been arrsted in connection with rape and murder of a young Polish girl in Sheffield, Yorkshire. We have our own monsters too, we do not need to import any!!!</p>

			<p>Ah the benefits of multiculturalism. And it is pretty obvious the guy is an immigrant. Europe used to be safe in almost all cities. No problem walking around at night. Sure there were the rare instances of violence but that was pretty much the domain of the US. The Europeans used to tell us the guns caused all of our violence (now they see it was really the minorities, not guns). Now look at Paris. Like America, there are no-go places in European cities. I was mugged in Amsterdam 15 years ago by one of those cultural enriching immgirants (N. African/Middle E.). How can otherwise intelligent people not correlate the increase in crime with the increase of non white immigrants? It is easy to see wiht hard statistics. Sigh. Western countries won&rsquo;t learn until it is too late I am afraid.</p>

			<p>Since when does Sweden care about Swedes ? If they cared, why don&rsquo;t they stop non White immigration into Sweden, which is turning Sweden into Paris ????</p>

<p>it seems as though he demanded the young Swedish woman for sex, she refused, resisted, struggled and he killed her.</p>

			<p>How odd that they&rsquo;re warning Swedes about Paris, when they show no such concern about Swedes in Stockholm.</p>
<p>(And yes, the crime is all coming from basically the same element of people, but it&rsquo;s forbidden to say that.  If you can&rsquo;t identify the problem, you&rsquo;ll never be able to solve it.)</p>
<p>The Swedes were just too white, and too homogeneous, both not allowable in the brave new PC world that is being constructed for us. The one-world people behind the scenes couldn&rsquo;t stand that, so the Swedes have to be sacrificed, whatever the cost, on the altar of Political Correctness.</p>
<p>Thus, the crime-causing element and the one-world-promoting element have a strange, often unwitting, alliance in breaking down the host population. They don&rsquo;t even like one another, they can&rsquo;t stand one another, but they need one another. Each one, for the time being, serves the other&rsquo;s purpose.</p>

			<p>I remember a wonderful date with a beautiful blond Swedish gal and her beautifull Chinese friend at the Sydney Opra House to see &#8220;Berlin&#8221;.  It was a set-up, actually, with me as the deer in the headlights, but it was good, and those pretty young women as a matched pair got me all sorts of looks.</p>
<p>I dress up rather well, and a Swedish gal about five-feet-nothing and dressed to the nines was a dream date.  European women know how to dress.  Why would anyone want to hurt one?</p>

			<p>The girl was from an upper class family living in an area free from non-whites. She had thus no street smarts at all.</p>

			<p>I know people who live in Paris. They state over the past 10 years it has become pretty much of a 3rd world sewer. This was due to France&rsquo;s liberal immigration policies. Now they are paying a high price for those policies.</p>

  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
But I&rsquo;ll wager she got a good dose of indoctrination, nonetheless, as to the wonderful &#8220;vibrant&#8221; benefits of non-whites and multi-culturalism.<br>
  <br>
Another innocent victim sacrificed at the bloody altar of the multiculties.</p>
