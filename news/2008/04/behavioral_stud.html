						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The [Fairfax] county School Board, which oversees one of the country&rsquo;s largest and most diverse suburban school systems, is scheduled to vote tonight on whether to accept a staff report that concludes, in part, that black and Hispanic students and special education students received lower marks than white and Asian American students for demonstration of &#8220;sound moral character and ethical judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such findings have prompted a debate on the potential bias in how teachers evaluate student behavior and how the school system analyzes and presents information about race. Board member Martina A. &#8220;Tina&#8221; Hone (At Large), who is African American, called the school system&rsquo;s decision to break down data by race &#8220;potentially damaging and hurtful.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For older students, the report&rsquo;s findings on moral character were based on the number of state-reported disciplinary infractions, a measure where minority students tend to be overrepresented. Disparities among groups were found, however, to be slimmer for eighth-graders and negligible for 12th-graders.</p>
<p>The analysis also reported gaps among groups of students in skills such as being able to &#8220;contribute effectively within a group dynamic,&#8221; resolve conflicts and make healthy life choices.</p>
<p>School officials said they were seeking to broaden the definition of student achievement and devise new ways to measure progress toward key goals to prepare a 21st-century workforce.</p>
<p>Officials acknowledge that their initial findings are not conclusive. Hone intends to propose that a vote on the report be delayed until the School Board and staff members have had time to discuss the merits of data analysis according to race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2006, after 33 public meetings, the board approved the goals for life skills and sought to define behavior that reflects sound moral character, such as &#8220;Model honesty and integrity&#8221; and &#8220;Respect people, property and authority.&#8221; School officials, at the board&rsquo;s direction, then hunted for relevant indicators to measure progress and analyzed them.</p>
<p>In some cases, sufficient data were not available to make a meaningful analysis of some goals. Officials said they intend to revise report cards and create surveys for teachers, students and high school graduates to assess life-skills goals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Board member Ilryong Moon (At Large), a Korean American, said he was &#8220;perplexed&#8221; that disparities in measures of character education seemed to echo academic achievement gaps.</p>
<p>Educators typically examine racial and ethnic patterns in academic data to spot problems and direct resources to students who need them most. Members of the NAACP&rsquo;s Fairfax chapter criticized the school system&rsquo;s use of such methods for the character education analysis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think you can classify a whole group and say they have lower character or morality,&#8221; said Janice Winters, a member of the chapter&rsquo;s education committee. &#8220;It sends a poor message to the students: &#8216;Oh, I&rsquo;m black, and they don&rsquo;t expect me to behave.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Are some of these school board members total idiots?  Don&rsquo;t they have eyes, can&rsquo;t they hear, hopefully they aren&rsquo;t brain dead?</p>
<p>My wife is a social worker who does mental health therapy in several rural Alabama counties. Livingston High School, in Sumter County is 100% black. In last year&rsquo;s graduating class, the &#8220;class&#8221; of 2007, there was only ONE female who was not already a single mother. </p>
<p>Who needs a report, anyone with an IQ above 85 (the average for blacks) can see that these kids are not of &ldquo;sound moral character and ethical judgment.&rdquo; For the rest of their lives they will remain stupid, poor, and dependent. </p>
<p>Of course, I not so sure about the &#8220;stupid&#8221; part, they will have the rest of us working and paying taxes to support them. <br>

			<p>Heck you can see this on display anywhere there are anchor babies and whites in the same room. Anchor babies will be out of control and hitting, whites tha same age will be more self-controlled, as whites have less testosterone, and more frontal lobe. Asians actually dissapear, you dont notice them at all. Blacks can be babling at a pretty early age, and make you believe they are gonna be doctors or something. Blacks are more entertaining (they almost talk at adult levels), hispanics loud and violent, whites and asians are quiet, but whites tend to smile more. Anyone who has worked with kids of diverse background sees the same thing in children.</p>

			<p>What is &#8220;potentially hurtful&#8221; is NOT addresssing these issues and INSISTING on correction. It hurts those of low moral character and those whom they victimize.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&rsquo;m black, and they don&rsquo;t expect me to behave.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is coorect. If you are black you are more likely to not behave and I will continue to be wary around you unless you take it upon yourselves to correct this &#8220;trend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let me tell you that as a current engineering student, these two points are overemphasized, and for good reason.  Even at my level the few non-Whites segregate themselves before the chance is even given, usually with poor results.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s correct, Janice.  When someone is black we expect that they&rsquo;ll not behave, achieve, or show character.  The last 50 years have been good enough evidence for us.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because blacks with IQs below 90 drop out in the 9th grade, leaving more intelligent blacks with fewer pathologies.</p>

			<p>Where have these morons  been for the last 40 years during which well known associations between IQ and other behavioral factors such as poor impulse control, etc have been demonstrated over and over again.  Blacks in particular are not only far behind whites in terms of IQ, but are less able to think abstractly, less able to control their impulses, more violent and less creative.  So of course as a group they will not preform as well as whites on the behavioral traits involved in &#8220;good citizenship&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p>What really drives me mad is the fact that such well known differences seems to be discovered anew everyday by people who should know better.  The race problem in America has many aspects to it but the one that sticks out the most is the systematic denial of reality, presumably because of its possible effects on the self-image of a group whose self image is already far more positive that the facts support.  The greatest casualty of the current PC consensus on race is truth.</p>

			<p>It goes without saying that if the data showed whites to be the least moral group it would be front page news and none of these leftists would be trying to suppress the study on the grounds that it was &#8216;potentially damaging and hurtful&#8221;.</p>

<p>Liberals and so-called &#8216;progressives&rsquo; are notorious for backward thinking. They like to believe that poverty causes crime. They also say they believe that the stereotype creates the behavior when the behavior is what gives rise to the stereotype. Do away with the stereotype image they say and the behavior will improve or so their theory goes.</p>
<p>Blacks are a stereotype which is why anywhere they are, no matter where you are in the world, people see the same behavior and draw the same conclusions. </p>
<p>We have the saying, &#8216;a leopard can&rsquo;t change his spots&rsquo; because it is a universal truth.</p>
<p>Whatever program they enact will fail. Then they will do what liberals and &#8216;progressives&rsquo; do best; they will come up with a new theory to explain why their old theory didn&rsquo;t work when in theory, the first theory was considered flawless. Around and around and around and around&hellip;<br>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Moral-character data on race said to be &ldquo;potentially damaging and hurtful.&rdquo;&gt;</p>
<p>Meaning that TRUTH HURTS!</p>
<p>Call it popular wisdom, call it subjective evidence. Call it whatever you want&hellip;  REALITY confirms what most of us believe. That Blacks, particularly are poor workers, utterly lacking in a work ethic or acceptable attitude.</p>
<p>Talk to teachers. Visit schools with a large Black student body and learn for yourself. They tend to be class clowns. Goofing off, unmotivated, given to chronic absenteeism and tardiness. </p>
<p>Then explain WHY a Black in his early 20s, lacking even a high school degree, would be an asset if hired by YOUR firm.</p>
<p>As to Mexicans (Hispanics) thievery appears to be second nature to them. Based on personal observations and what I&rsquo;ve read and heard. Amply confirming the Mexican belief: You HAVE TO STEAL if you want to get ahead.</p>

An excellent book by someone with dual Phd&rsquo;s which everyone should read.</p>
<p>Many of the conclusions regarding racial disparities that I came to acknowledge as accurate were scientifically proven in an elegant,rigorous,systematic way that made it difficult to put the book down.</p>
<p>Did it confirm my &#8220;superiority complex&#8221; of being white?,no, it concludes that Asians(Mongoloids) have the highest IQ&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Every thinking person is aware of these truths by now,it is only the propagandists who are perpetuating the nonsense of racial egalitarianism.</p>

			<p>This country cannot continue to subsidize parents who cannot properly raise their children.  The end result of this is a complete dumbing down of the educational system, so a majority can achieve.  What will happen when whites are not the majority?  Parents need to be held accountable for underachieving students, whether it be morally or scholastically.  I truly believe it would be less expensive for the taxpayer, and far better for the child to be removed from the parent if the child is not meeting the milestones they should.  Call it what you will, but the current system isn&rsquo;t working either.</p>

But the message these race hustler&rsquo;s send is that misbehaving is okay or even beneficial. The NAACP is honoring outspoken racist, anti=Semite and conspiracy lie spreader Jeremiah Wright. Or when the blacks, like BET, went out of their way last year to honor the violent criminals from Jena last year. </p>

			<p>Again, all I have to say about this article is that the liberal/progressive programs, will finish off these students for good, where they might have a chance, if personal responsibilty for their actions, was brought back to the schools.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Members of the NAACP&rsquo;s Fairfax chapter criticized the school system&rsquo;s use of such methods for the character education analysis.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, the study is correct.</p>

<p>I could not help but notice that whether it is *true* was considered irrelevant.</p>

			<p>One gets the idea, that to be &#8220;politically correct&#8221;, one must shut his eyes, ears, and disregard all evidence showing what Blacks, Hispanic and other minorities really are like&hellip; and believe only what one is ordered to believe.</p>
<p>Pretty much like living in a totalitarian regime. Now a question: Where is the &#8220;re-education&#8221; center I&rsquo;m supposed to report to? To be &#8220;cured&#8221; this selfish notion of &#8220;thinking for myself. Even forming opinions, based on what I see, hear and read   &mdash;   like those endless horror stories about Black or Hispanic perpetrated crime, for example. Or what I hear from friends who happen to be law enforcement officials.</p>

The Evolution of Racial Differences in Morality<br>
Michael Levin</p>
<p>It offers an insight into WHY morality differences between in races, particularly between northern and southerners.</p>
<p>Debate all they want about social causes. It&rsquo;s only when ice age evolution enters the picture that reasons become clear.</p>
