						<p>Brigitte Bardot has been accused of inciting racial hatred against Muslims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brigitte Bardot, now an animal rights activist, has been convicted four times since 1997 on similar charges</p>
<p>In December 2006, Miss Bardot, 73, now an animal rights activist, wrote to President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, then the interior minister, criticising the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep without first stunning them.</p>
<p>In the letter published by the magazine Info-Journal and handed out to members of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, she wrote: &#8220;We&rsquo;re fed up with being led by the nose by this population that is destroying us, destroying our country by imposing its acts&#8221;.</p>
<p>Several French anti-racism groups filed for charges of &#8220;inciting discrimination and racial hatred&#8221; against Muslims.</p>
<p>Miss Bardot was not in court, citing &#8220;difficulties in getting around&#8221;, but her lawyer read out a note in which she said she was &#8220;appalled&#8221; at the &#8220;harassment&#8221; of anti-racism groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will never keep quiet&#8221; until animals are stunned before ritual slaughter, she added, saying she was &#8220;tired and weary&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I too am tired and weary&#8221;, said the prosecutor Anne de Fontette, pointing out that Miss Bardot had been convicted four times since 1997 on similar charges.</p>
<p>&#8220;She might as well write that Arabs should be thrown out of France&#8221;, she said. &#8220;It is time to hand out heftier sentences&#8221;.</p>
<p>The heaviest penalty to date was in 2004, when the star of &#8220;And God Created Woman&#8221; was fined Â£3,300 for inciting racial hatred in a book. In A Cry In The Silence, she &#8220;opposed the Islamisation of France&#8221; and racial mixing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see racism and xenophobia, but I only see the expression of her fight&#8221; [against animal slaughter practices], said her lawyer, Francois-Xavier Kelidjian.</p>
<p>A lawyer for the French human rights league, a plaintiff, said that while Miss Bardot deserved respect as an actress and animal welfare campaigner, that did not give her &#8220;any special rights&#8221; to be racist, and called for the court to &#8220;put a stop&#8221; to such declarations.</p>
<p>The verdict is due on June 3.<br>

											<p>
							<i>Reuters, April 15, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutor Anne de Fontette told the court she was seeking a tougher sentence than usual, adding: &#8220;I am a little tired of prosecuting Mrs Bardot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bardot did not attend the trial because she said she was physically unable to. The verdict is expected in several weeks.</p>
<p>French anti-racist groups complained last year about comments Bardot made about the Muslim feast of Eid al-Adha in a letter to President Nicolas Sarkozy that was later published by her foundation.</p>
<p>Muslims traditionally mark Eid al-Adha by slaughtering a sheep or another animal to commemorate the prophet Abraham&rsquo;s willingness to sacrifice his son on God&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p>France is home to 5 million Muslims, Europe&rsquo;s largest Muslim community, making up 8 percent of France&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us, destroying our country and imposing its acts,&#8221; the star of &lsquo;And God created woman&rsquo; and &lsquo;Contempt&rsquo; said.</p>
<p>Bardot has previously said France is being invaded by sheep-slaughtering Muslims and published a book attacking gays, immigrants and the unemployed, in which she also lamented the &#8220;Islamisation of France&#8221;.<br>

			<p>The only people who belong behind bars are her persecutors.  Every one of them.  The French are supposed to be ashamed of the collaborationist Vichy government of 1940-1944, but the current government is much worse.  At least the collaborators didn&rsquo;t invite the Germans to invade.  </p>

			<p>de fontette should be charged with being a traitor to her race and nation and imprisoned for life. The french had better learn really quickly or they will lose their country again. And this time the U.S. and U.K. may not be able to help liberate them this time around.</p>

			<p>So it takes a 73 yr old woman to say what, evidently, no one else in France has the balls to say.<br>
So of course, she will be prosecuted (as well as persecuted) for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;this time the U.S. and U.K. may not be able to help liberate them this time around.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;re too busy following in like fashion.</p>

			<p>What a great woman - Brigitte Bardot</p>
<p>Check out her photos from the 60s and 70s.</p>
<p>What a babe!</p>
<p>Usually women who look anything near as good as she and are in with the jet set movie types, they usually mate with the likes of Seal, OJ, Roman Polanski, Billy Joel or lose their looks a bit and then go in for bad Lefty politics (anti Apartheid stuff), but not Brigitte Bardot.</p>
<p>One of her films was titled:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.And God made Woman&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yes. Let&rsquo;s pray that God makes a few more women like Brigitte Bardot - one for me and one for the lad who sells the most subscriptions to American Renaissance Magazine.</p>

			<p>Ms.Bardot has been on this crusade against amimal cruelty and the Islamification of her country for years, she should be given the Medal of Honour, not persecuted. In any case how can she be accused of &#8216;inciting <i>racial<i> hatred against Muslims? Could she also incite racial hatred against vegetarians or Catholics? If this is how France treats it&rsquo;s patriotic citizens then I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s pretty much all over bar the head banging. Arc.</i></i></p>

			<p>God bless Bardot!  She&rsquo;s got more character in her little finger than the whole lot of sell-out traitors running the French government. She&rsquo;s a modern Joan of Arc, even at 73, and the brainwashed French zombies fail to appreciate her.<br>
  <br>
Well, they didn&rsquo;t appreciate Joan, either. They burned her at the stake. They&rsquo;re only fining Brigitte to death until she&rsquo;s ruined and dies in poverty.</p>

That a Frenchwoman should be (repeatedly) prosecuted by another Frenchwoman FOR DEFENDING THE FRENCH is evidence of the sick self-hatred of the suicidal soon-to-be-slaughterhouse known as Eurabia. </p>
<p>Madame Bardot, you are an inspiration to us all. I&rsquo;m just sorry that you have to go through this irritating nonsense   &mdash;   and pay these ludicrous (though apparently not yet &#8220;hefty&#8221; enough) fines   &mdash;   for doing what previous generations of continentals were not only PERMITTED to do, but were in fact EXPECTED to do! And that is, to be true to one&rsquo;s national heritage in the face of foreign threats! <br>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea.  How about allowing free speech in France?  How can anyone incite racial hatred?  What about the hateful behaviors of the immigrants?  People ultimately decide who they hate and why but we all know which side the government is on.</p>

			<p>Joan Of Arc&hellip; Oriana Falaci, Briggit Bardot,   Yes sometimes it is the women that see the writing on the wall and have the courage to say what they see! Bardot is making the mistake of having courage and loving her race and culture amidst a population of slaves, Amongst a population of people that don&rsquo;t mind being debased&hellip; as long as its not &#8220;too&#8221; obvious, and they all agree in harmony to deny the obvious,and use the word love to sweeten the self betrayal. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;I too am tired and weary&rdquo;, said the prosecutor Anne de Fontette, pointing out that Miss Bardot had been convicted four times since 1997 on similar charges.</p>
<p>A giant step backward to the Dark Ages where the truth was disallowed if it was counter to approved thoughts and theories.</p>
<p>The media in 2006 reported that, &#8220;In the first six months of this year there were 50,000 acts of urban violence by Muslims. On average 15 police officers, fire fighters or other public officials are attacked per day and 100 cars are set alight per night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gangs of immigrant vandals operate in a paramilitary fashion. A spokesman for the French police officers union, himself a policeman, states that France is in the midst of a &ldquo;civil war.&rdquo; </p>
<p>After so much constant black and Muslim violence, the degenerative French authorities have the unmitigated gall to put someone on trial for making an accurate observation any fool knows is true.  Amazing.</p>
<p>The present government should be replaced by people with at least half a brain.  What an improvement in intelligence that would be.</p>
<p>They are going down in large scale civil upheaval, and they deserve every bit of the ensuing chaos.  </p>
<p>The last time such government arrogance prevailed was 1789 when the ruling elite was set upon and the guillotine was in constant use.</p>

			<p>  So we all seem to think that &#8220;Freedom of Speech&#8221; exists in America do we?? Anyhone reading this want to bet what would happen if a man or woman chose to stand up in public and suggest that all Arabs and Muslims should be put out of the U.S. (which I believe by the way) I am in the middle east and know the Arab Muslims all to well and what their goal is for the world and it is not pretty. But French politicians (and ours) only see 50 million voters who likely vote en-bloc for a chosen candidate who would support their ultimate overthrow of the government and installation of a Muslim/sharia government.</p>

			<p>It is well known by many that the more multicultural a state is, the more draconian the goverment becomes in it&rsquo;s suppression of speech and ideas from the dwindling majority that are not approved and PC. In the case of Eurabia the chosen minority are the vicious Muslims, who are now protected by the vicious cultural Marxists.</p>
<p>As a Canadian I have a special empathy for Ms. Bardot. We have an EU-SSR style govermental apparatus for crushing non-PC speech and thoughtcrimes here in my country. The case of Ezra Levant, Mark Steyn, and many many others who are less well known come to mind, all victims of the absurdly named &#8220;Human Rights&#8221; Commissions. </p>
<p>As things get worse in Europe (and the rest of the West) due to insane mass immigration of hostile foreign elements, the more vicious will be the persecution of dissidents who have the courage to raise their voices in protest. From fines, to jails, and then&hellip;to the use of naked violence. The trend is inevidable.<br>
To Ms Bardot: you go girl! MY respect for you is great. </p>

			<p>Brigitte Bardot has restored my faith in European women. She is magnificent in standing up for her principles. Yes, certain cultures encourage cruelty to animals! She is a patriot who doesn&rsquo;t want France to turn into Algeria. If only our flakey Hollywood floozies were half as good as her. </p>

			<p>I remember how many of our good, British and American young men died on the fields of France in the last war, in order to give these people back their freedom. Some of these deaths in my own family.  So, when I read stories like this and realise what has happened to that &#8216;freedom&rsquo; we bled for, it makes me want to vomit.   How do pathetic, left wing, pseudo-intellectuals like this &#8216;Anne de Fontette&rsquo; attain positions of such importance.  What unseen, frightening power is behind her and her ilke? There is no place for Islam in any European country - indeed, any &#8216;civilised&rsquo; country. Just ask their &#8216;neighbours&rsquo;, the Hindus and Buddhists, who are most qualified to know. They should all be deported back to their own countries, where they can stone, stab, shoot, rape, blow-up and generally abuse each other to their hearts content.  Jews, Hindu&rsquo;s, Bhuddhists, etc,etc, have lived among us in peace and friendship for generations.  Muslims HATE us and will never stop until we are brought to our knees - then, when they have absolute control (frighteningly soon!), the great slaughter will begin.  That is, of course, unless we wake up in time.  People like this &#8216;Fontette&rsquo; woman should be ridiculed, belittled and drummed out of office, never to be allowed to hold a public position again.  These are the true enemies of the state.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Give ole Brigotte Bardot a medal for that one&#8221;</p>
<p>They do give out medals for this sort of thing&hellip; but only for racial hatred of whites. Not just medals, all kinds of esteemed awards. Promoting &#8216;diversity&rsquo; or something, it&rsquo;s called. What it&rsquo;s called in France, I have no idea. That is, sticking up for the interests of non-whites. It must be their advanced attitudes and outlooks, and behaviors. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not &#8216;hatred&rsquo;, but in fact the highest enlightenment, speaking up for people of color.  </p>

I respect what Brigitte Bardot stand for! Animals need protection, we are in 2008!<br>
Muslims are like Protestants or Catholics and many others,a religious denomination not a race.It seems that now everything has to be labeled racist.<br>
Thank you Brigitte for all the positive actions to have taken for the rest of us.<br>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing I like about Bardot, she doesn&rsquo;t follow the Leftist Hollywood crowd&rsquo;s obsession with self-image; her concerns are for mistreated animals, for France and for her people, truly a Frenchwoman with enormous courage, beauty and grace. Sure she has grown old and wrinkly but she has kept her integrity and principals. How often do we hear American actors defending their country? hardly ever and the opposite sentiments are more often heard.  Sadly one of the few patriots just passed away.</p>
<p>I read that on hearing a passer-by remark  &#8220;Is that her? she&rsquo;s ugly!&#8221;, Bardot retorted loudly &#8220;No,I&rsquo;m not ugly, I&rsquo;m Bardot&#8221;.  <br>

			<p>I guess it has become improper to speak the truth these days. I know people living in Paris. They state young muzzies routinely riot and burn cars in some areas of the city. The authorities do little to control these disturbances while the citizens must cower in their homes. The muzzies are brave there due to the fact the citizens are largley unarmed thus defenseless. I don&rsquo;t think it to be wise to try those tatics in America.</p>

			<p>You know I&rsquo;ve seen videos on Youtube of these thugs street-fighting.  At first I thought it was somewhere in America but nope, it was France.  I can&rsquo;t believe France is an absolute wreck and seems to be getting worse.  At least more French are being born and they&rsquo;re deporting many illegals but it appears to be too late to me. I met a white Turkish looking guy who said he visited Paris and a bunch of African thugs attacked him while he was with a group of friends.  </p>

			<p>Bardot has for a long time denounced anything or group that torments animals - in her view.  She was motivated in this particular case by the Muslim spring holiday that features the slaughter of lambs through throat slitting.  But she is also famous for denouncing the Islamization of France.  I support her in both cases.</p>

French people that that once valiantly stood up fought against the Nazi occupation today meekly allow third-worlders dictate national policy to them. The French should hang their heads in shame!</p>

<p>How true. One of the first things the liberal elite did here in the UK in the 60&rsquo;s was to abolish capital punishment. Also laws have been passed so that guns are extremely difficult to obtain. Except if you&rsquo;re a criminal of course. Now a householder here is scared to even tackle a burglar in his own home in case he gets charged with assault.  The effect of these laws passed by this totally corrupt system has produced a nation of bewildered, cowering sheep &amp; is rotten to the core. Americans must never give up their guns &amp; be turned into sheep. But thank God for the internet where each day more &amp; more people are being awakened to the truth. If you&rsquo;d like to know how a society can be infiltrated by pseudo-Marxist fifth-columnists in prominent positions then do a search on a UK &#8216;charity group&rsquo; called Common Purpose founded by an &#8216;ex-Marxist&rsquo; who worked in ex-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott&rsquo;s parliamentary office. This group  offers seminars in &#8216;leadership&rsquo; to selected people like judges, police, media, politicians etc. A club for the elite boys &amp; girls. It is spine-chilling what our traitorous so-called leaders are up to. They have their own one-world agenda. But our truth is growing daily &amp; cultural marxism like it&rsquo;s predecessor economic marxism will collapse under a mountain of it&rsquo;s own lies.<br>
i read a while ago Common Purpose was founded on similar US groups but with a different name which I cannot remember. Perhaps one of amren&rsquo;s knowledgable readers can.</p>

			<p><b>&ldquo;I too am tired and weary&rdquo;, said the prosecutor Anne de Fontette, pointing out that Miss Bardot had been convicted four times since 1997 on similar charges. </b></p>
<p><i>SHE  </i>is tired and weary?  Aw, poor thing!   How old is she, anyway?   What about 73 year-old Bardot?  Has this been a party for her? Wouldnt she like to have some peace in her old age?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know something more about this determined prosecutor [persecutor], Anne de Fontette.  Either she&rsquo;s a ferociously committed Communist or she&rsquo;s married to an Arab  (or both)   &mdash;   or something of the sort.  Perhaps her children are married to Africans, or she has adopted some.  I&rsquo;d bet anything on it!  That is <i>always </i> the case in matters like this.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Unless Whites remember they do have a backbone and stand up to the immigrants, immigrant-caused social problems will never end. &#8220;<br>
FedUp<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
With or without immigrants, the social problems will never end so long as the instigators remain.</p>
<p>The immigrants (and other so-called &#8220;minorities&#8221;) would never be the REAL problem without the constant support and egging-on of certain elements among the white elite who influence legislation, write newspaper columns, produce TV programs,  sway governments, and pass laws favoring them. On their own, the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; could never have accomplished this   &mdash;   not without powerful help from those insider elements (a few of whom are now having second thoughts about this Frankenstien monster which THEY have created).</p>
<p>How odd that Islam and Marxism, which are natural enemies at opposite poles from each other, find common ground on the issue of race.  Here at least, they have made a temporary truce. Something like the Hitler-Stalin pact. That is, until they can get back to the business of eradicating each other, after they&rsquo;ve taken care of us.</p>
<p>A year ago, Sarkozy was elected  President (with massive help from the media). Many Frenchmen (frightened off from LePen by scare stories in the press) voted for the tough-talking Sarkozy in confidence that he would finally  do something about the Afro-Arab problem.  Well, its one year now.  What has he done?  The sporadic riots have continued, and even gotten worse. The alienation and crime in the suburbs continue.  Sarkozy is now proposing affirmative action for immigrants and to give them still more aid and concessions.  Hardly what most Frenchmen had in mind!</p>
<p>Forget about Islam; religion is not really the issue here (though that&rsquo;s not to say that it&rsquo;s  entirely irrelevant either). The main issue is basically racial. (That&rsquo;s revealed by the fact that they prosecute criticism of Moslems as racial crimes.)   The fact is that the Moslems/Arabs/North Africans are a very racially scrambled group; and those who are in power in France, both out front and behind the scenes, love that.  North Africans represent exactly the  race-blind &#8220;diversity&#8221; that they seek, and which they are determined (in all our countries) to impose upon us all. </p>
<p>I remember reading a comment made by some &#8220;French&#8221; movie producer in a newspaper article, back some 25 or 30 years ago &hellip; before the immigrant wave in Europe had become so intense.  He said that he <i>loved </i> coming to New York - absolutely adored it! - because of all the &#8220;wonderful racial mix&#8221;  that he saw here. </p>
<p>Well, now he doesn&rsquo;t have to come to New York anymore. They have reproduced exactly the same marxist mess in Paris, if not worse.  He must be very happy now.</p>
<p>Or maybe he&rsquo;s starting to become afraid. (?)<br>

So true.  I have seen this many times.  One passionate fanatic can outweigh 100 ordinary, passive, cud-chewing citizens. Perhaps even a thousand.  They worm their way into key positions and then push through their programs and tyrannize the docile majority    &mdash;   most of whom haven&rsquo;t a clue as to what&rsquo;s going on, many of whom don&rsquo;t even care.</p>

			<p>For heaven&rsquo;s sake, some of you posters seem to believe that the prosecutor has a personal vendetta against Ms. Bardot.  </p>
<p>She is simply a Prosecutor (lawyer) who has to administer the LAW.  Or she could quit her profession, which I don&rsquo;t think many of YOU would do if you were in her position.  </p>
<p>The LAWS are the problem.  Not the particular individual who is professionally obligated to administer the law.  If Ms. Whats-her-name-prosecutor quit today, there&rsquo;d be another prosecutor assigned to the case tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thing is, many of these &#8220;anti-incitement to hate&#8221; laws were put into place in order to prosecute leaders of a certain religion who preach HATE. But we can&rsquo;t play favorites or address specific Certain Religions Who Are Causing Problems, now can we?  </p>
<p>Fight to make sure these kinds of LAWS are not passed in the USA   &mdash;   even if it may be too late&hellip;</p>
<p>Americans&rsquo; right to Freedom of Speech has already been severely trampled upon and will continue to die unless Americans WAKE UP.</p>

<p><br>
Sorry. I must to some extent disagree. I think this prosecutor shows an excess of zeal (confirmable when you look into her background) in going after Miss Bardot.  Certainly, the laws are a big problem, no agrument there, but no law gets enforced until some official undertakes to enforce it.  (There are many, many laws on the books which are never enforced - that is, until somebody arbitrarily decides to do so.) There has to be a human factor that starts the process. </p>
<p>Do you think that laws just somehow enforce themselves? If so, our immigration laws would all be enforced and we would have no illegal alien problem!  The fact is that too many officials either zealously enforce or choose to disregard whatever laws they personally like or dislike, at their own caprice.  </p>
<p>So the problem is twofold: both the laws that are in place, and the persons who are empowered to enforce them.<br>
