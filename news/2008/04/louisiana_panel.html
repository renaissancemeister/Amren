						<p>A state Senate panel rejected a bill on Tuesday that would make it a crime to wear one&rsquo;s pants too low, even as Cajun-country towns around Louisiana have been banning saggy pants from their streets.</p>
<p>Sen. Derrick Shepherd&rsquo;s bill would have made it illegal to wear, in public, clothing that &ldquo;intentionally exposes undergarments or intentionally exposes any portion of the pubic hair, cleft of the buttocks or genitals.&rdquo; Violators would have faced a fine of up to $175 and eight days of community service.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shepherd said the state should take a stand against droopy pants, which he called just one example of widespread indecency in contemporary clothing styles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shorts are getting shorter, the tops are getting smaller, the cleavage is getting larger,&rdquo; said Shepherd, also a Democrat. &ldquo;When are we going to say, &lsquo;Enough is enough&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no objection, the Senate judiciary panel voted against moving the measure to the floor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About a dozen Louisiana towns and cities have enacted or are considering bans on saggy pants.</p>
<p>The style is believed to have started in prisons, where inmates are issued ill-fitting jumpsuits but no belts to prevent hangings and beatings. The look was popularized in gangster rap videos.</p>

			<p>This is obviously a flawed attempt at social engineering. The IDEA is that if they are not allowed to DRESS like thugs they won&rsquo;t ACT like thugs. It is a breathtakingly naive concept. Changing a persons clothes doesn&rsquo;t change their mentality.</p>

			<p>I think these kinds of laws already exist, in terms of indecent exposure.  So it will do nothing to stop what we know as &#8220;sagging.&#8221;  Also, look for anti-sagging law to be enforced mainly among young whites, to cut off ACLU/NAACP whining. </p>

			<p>Let them wear clown pants for all I care, wearing their pants in such a fashion only lets everyone know what they are, gives warning to others to avoid them and keep a watchful eye out when they approach. It also slows the cretins down when they try something that requires them to use both hands since the first thing that happens is their pants fall down.</p>

			<p>Another bunch of spineless legislators coveting the black vote. I personally find it offensive seeing someone with their pants down around their ass. Especially when they are holding their pants up with one hand while pulling their gentalia down the street with the other. But then, I guess these legislators like observing that sort of thing. </p>

			<p>The droopy pants look just make them look more stupid than they already are. If you did not have a bad opinion of a black before seeing them waddle along with their ass hanging out you surely will after. Can they possibly look more stupid and dare I say backward?</p>

<p>Pray, how does a jumsuit allow for one&rsquo;s pants to hang around their rear-end, when the very design of a jumpsuit would make this impossible? Try again&hellip;</p>

			<p>This ridiculous practice would stop if the people they meet would point and laugh hysterically when they came in view. No teen likes to be the butt of a joke. And this has got to be the worst non-style yet.</p>

			<p>Something about those droopy baggy pants, always makes them appear like overgrown toddlers, right down to the waddle in their walk.  When you see adult males dressed that way, it is a sure sign they are in a state of suspended adolescence, that they will likely never to outgrow. <br>

			<p>&hellip;.&#8221;The style is believed to have started in prisons&#8221;&hellip;..</p>
<p>It looks like the author is either uninformed or he&rsquo;s walking the fine PC line.  The style started in prisons.</p>
<p>Wearing too-large drawers low started in prisons by black inmates in order to advertise that they were available for sex for either money, favors or recreation. Having worked in corrections, this simple method has been known far and wide for years. </p>
<p>When drawing their weekly clothing allowance, some blacks would ask for pants 2 or 3 sizes larger.  In my state, they were denied, but they made do with what was given them.</p>
<p>Wearing the oversized coats, shirts and jackets, by the way, is done so as to be able to hide weapons.  As one black inmate told me; &#8220;you can hide a sawed-off &#8216;gauge&rsquo; (12 gauge shotgun) if you got a big enough coat&#8221;. </p>
<p>AIDS is rampant among blacks, and it isn&rsquo;t just because of dirty needs for their drug use.   </p>

			<p>Slaves to fashion, victims of crime.  Such is the black culture here in the U.S. of A.</p>
<p>Shame is the underside of this narcissism and it has been validated through research. Read Andrew Morrion&rsquo;s book on that topic.  It&rsquo;s entitled, &#8220;Shame: The Underside of Narcissism.&#8221;</p>
<p>While not voiced, blacks unconsciously believe themselves to have prominent cognitive deficits, and their self-absorption as well as their &#8220;fashion statements&#8221; reflect just that.</p>

<p>Oh?  Try wearing a red shirt in LA or any town of any size in California.  That usually gets you beat up and sometimes killed.  Clothing can be and is often a uniform of a movement.</p>
<p>But I am happy to see these fools with their crotches down to their knees because it makes running more difficult.</p>
