						<p>Swedes not so happy their country is changing.</p>
<p>After years of welcoming asylum seekers with open arms, Swedes have begun to question the changing nature of their society. Now, as the country moves to the right, Iraqis and Somalis are increasingly facing repatriation</p>
<p>A Christian from the Dora neighbourhood, Nina paid $18,000 to a people smuggler after militants came to her house to offer her family a choice: pay them a tax, convert to Islam, or die.</p>
<p>Now she lives with two other families in a small apartment in the town of 82,000 where Bjorn Borg was born, that is home to AstraZeneca, the pharmaceuticals giant, and a factory building Scania trucks.</p>
<p>She has applied for the right to stay in Sweden as a refugee. A year ago it would have been straightforward. Not any more &mdash; not since Sweden embarked on a national debate over its asylum policy.</p>
<p>It is a policy that has seen Sodertalje alone take more Iraqi refugees than the UK and the US combined. But in Sweden&rsquo;s new political climate, it is no longer certain that Nina (not her real name) will be permitted to remain. A new court process for screening refugees has meant that while last year about 72 per cent of Iraqi asylum seekers &mdash; the largest group entering Sweden &mdash; were accepted, in the first few months of 2008 that figure was only 27 per cent.</p>
<p>Driving the asylum debate is the nature of places like Sodertalje, Rinkeby, Tensta &mdash; all on Stockholm&rsquo;s periphery &mdash; and the suburbs of cities like Malmo. All have substantial populations of refugees &mdash; Somalis, Iraqis and Assyrians. Most are largely segregated from Sweden&rsquo;s mainstream life.</p>
<p>The rethinking of Sweden&rsquo;s asylum policy is being pushed too by two years of record immigration and refugee arrivals. Last year this country of nine million received 18,599 asylum applications from fleeing Iraqis. And the question being asked is not only whether a country with the reputation for having one of the world&rsquo;s most generous policies towards refugees can continue to be so welcoming. It is also whether Sweden needs urgently to redraw its requirements for their integration. Whether, indeed, those being offered a safe haven should be required to be more &lsquo;Swedish&rsquo; and be dispersed from the core communities where they have settled.</p>
<p>The reframing of Sweden&rsquo;s attitude towards refugees has followed the election of a centre-right government in 2006 and also the reshaping of its politics with the re-emergence of the far right in the shape of the Sweden Democrats. The result has been a toughening of asylum policies and a hardening of the political discourse towards refugees.</p>
<p>Despite severe criticism from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees earlier this month, the Swedish government has drawn up a memorandum of understanding with the government of Iraq to return some 3,000 failed asylum seekers after the government&rsquo;s Migration Board ruled that there was &lsquo;no armed internal conflict&rsquo; in Iraq.</p>
<p>By this standard, nor is there a conflict in Somalia.</p>
<p>The ruling shocked Madeleine Seidlitz, a lawyer and refugee co-ordinator for Amnesty International Sweden. She recalls tough periods but says that the situation for refugees in Sweden is now more difficult than at any time she can remember.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We rarely see the courts giving the benefit of the doubt. We see judgments that are simply incorrect under international law. And there seems to be no interest in the courts in understanding the nature of the situation in the countries of the refugees they are dealing with.&rsquo; Not least, she means, Iraq and Somalia.</p>
<p>While Seidlitz believes that Sweden has become &lsquo;a harder place&rsquo;, she is puzzled over where the pressure for change is coming from, believing that it is the politicians who are pushing the process rather than necessarily reflecting changing public attitudes.</p>
<p>But the debate is not simply over the issue of who should be allowed to stay &mdash; or where failed asylum seekers should to be repatriated to. Another key word has emerged: integration.</p>
<p>The previous 12 years of Social Democratic rule, according to some of their critics on the right, was a period characterised by the flyktingkramarna &mdash; &lsquo;the refugee huggers&rsquo; &mdash; who showed &lsquo;excessive care&rsquo; towards the refugee population.</p>
<p>The result of those years, the Folkpartiet &mdash; part of the ruling coalition &mdash; claimed in its campaign for election had been the creation a &lsquo;segregated&rsquo; Sweden. So, earlier this month, the Folkpartiet&rsquo;s Minister for Integration, Nyamko Sabuni, told Swedish radio that her party was considering a mandatory course on Swedish values for would-be new citizens. For its part, the Social Democratic party has been forced to respond to the debate &mdash; focusing on Sodertalje.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sodertalje has more refugees from Iraq than all of North America,&rsquo; said party leader Mona Sahlin two weeks ago. &lsquo;That doesn&rsquo;t work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sahlin suggested that arriving refugees should no longer be given the choice, enshrined in Swedish law, of where they live, instead being assigned to a municipality for the first few years.</p>
<p>Ylva Brune, a journalist turned academic at Kalmar University, who has studied attitudes in the Swedish media towards immigrants, believes that the debate reflects the deep-seated contradictions in Swedish society towards outsiders &mdash; refugees in particular. &lsquo;It comes up from time to time, and I think it is re-emerging,&rsquo; she said last week.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have always had this conflict in our society between the frontier-guarding attitude and those who favour a more human rights attitude. And of course Sweden&rsquo;s authorities have always been afraid of those coming from outside Europe. &lsquo;</p>
<p>There is another contradiction. Despite toughening its stance, Sweden increasingly requires high levels of immigration in all sectors of its rebounding economy, in a country also faced with the challenges of an ageing population. Last year one third of all new jobs went to those born outside the country, a proportion expected to half.</p>
<p>But the key issue, according to Tobias Billstrom of the Moderate Party, part of the ruling coalition, is that the government wants to move from a supply-led pool of migrants heading for Sweden &mdash; many reaching the country via people smuggling &mdash; to a demand-led one, where Sweden decides who should come in and which roles they should fill.</p>
<p>Those likely to be affected by this change are the many asylum seekers arriving in a country that, while it accepts few refugees on Geneva Convention grounds, has nevertheless historically given them permission to remain.</p>
<p>Billstrom defends the new screening process that has reduced the number of refugee acceptances in recent months as &lsquo;safe&rsquo;, as he does the decision to repatriate failed asylum seekers to places like Iraq. &lsquo;I think you have to screen individual cases,&rsquo; Billstrom said. &lsquo;Not everyone at every time is under threat [in Iraq].&rsquo; It is not a view endorsed by the UNHCR.</p>
<p>Billstrom also backs a proposal to revise the law that insists on keeping family members together who are coming to join refugees already granted residency. In future, to be placed in the same town the original family members would have to show they have the means to house and support any new arrivals.</p>
<p>If one place is mentioned repeatedly in the debate, it is Sodertalje. A tidy little town of factories and housing blocks set on gently sloping wooded hills, dotted with grey granite outcrops and straddling a river, it has been thrust to the centre of the asylum and integration debate by the facts of its social composition.</p>
<p>Popular since the 1970s with first waves of Assyrian Christian refugees from the Middle East, it established itself as a magnet for each new wave of Middle Eastern refugees. These days, 40 per cent of its population is first or second generation immigrant.</p>
<p>Mayor Anders Lago, who backs the proposed change in the law to allow the government to disperse arriving refugees throughout Sweden, insists that he is not arguing for Sweden to turn its back on its history of accepting refugees. He says he is simply anxious to see no more settled in overcrowded Sodertalje.</p>
<p>He believes others should take up the strain. Next month he will address members of the US Congress to point out that more Iraqis come to his town than have been accepted in the US. &lsquo;Of course there are problems here. In the areas of most dense settlement of refugees &mdash; like Ronna &mdash; we have people living 15 to a flat. There are people living on mattresses on the floor. And of course it causes problems for the children. There are waiting lists for schools, with reports off some children waiting four months for a place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One part of the problem is the concentration. It is possible to live and get by in places like Ronna speaking only Arabic, not Swedish. And of course it feeds into the discussion: is it possible for Sweden to be so generous as it has been over the past 20-30 years? I think it is the question of whether the system is working. I think if it is possible to have a flat and work and an education it is OK. But the problem is when the system is not working.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Despite Billstrom&rsquo;s claims over the opportunities for foreigners in Sweden, the evidence &mdash; anecdotal and academic &mdash; suggests that many refugees struggle either to find work or work well below their educational achievements.</p>
<p>But even recent refugees like Ginbot Abraha, an Eritrean who arrived five years ago and now works in Sodertalje&rsquo;s introduction centre for new arrivals, admit there is a problem with the concentration of refugees in places such as Sodertalje.</p>
<p>Although he is positive about his own experience, he accepts that the &lsquo;trajectory of the argument in Swedish society is that there are more vocal forces hostile to foreigners in general, indicated by the re-emergence of a far right party with seats again in the municipal councils, including two in Sodertalje&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They say they come here to exploit the state welfare and can have a very negative effects on society. On the whole though,&rsquo; he insists, &lsquo;it is a misunderstanding of why people come to Sweden and it is an issue that needs a deeper understanding. They are not a burden on resources. They are a resource.&rsquo;<br>

			<p>Integration?  I thought by definition &#8220;refugees&#8221; are people taking refuge from a tough situation on the condition that they return when the situation has abated.  In all non-white countries this is in fact how it works - e.g. refugee camps in border regions.  Talking about integration just goes to show that this is not a refugee policy, it is essentially an open borders immigration policy for poor/destabilized countries, which is to say most of Africa and the middle east.</p>
<p>And anyone else catch the fact that the Iraqi woman who spent $18,000 to get to Sweden (average annual Iraqi income: $3,600) said she was given the option of paying a tax rather than just &#8220;death or conversion?&#8221;  There is no way the tax could have been more than a few hundred dollars.  All this just goes to show that this woman&rsquo;s story, and likely motivation as well, is very suspect.  </p>

<p>Ah, yes. The biggest failure of Western social policy is always the magic solution. Dear Sweden, ever heard of the United States?  </p>
<p>The answer is not integration or dispersement. The answer is a one-way ticket back to their country of origin. Asylum and refugee laws only circumvent restrictive immigration laws and are a direct route for getting welfare benefits.</p>
<p>Somalis in Sweden - the world&rsquo;s most primitive people mixed in with the world&rsquo;s most advanced. Good luck.</p>

<p> The only way white people will ever wake up is when they see white people lined up at gunpoint going into one side of a building and coming out as ash on the other. Even then there will be nonbelievers!</p>

			<p>Say what you want about the Somalis, they may actually have a pretty perceptive grasp of how to exploit the West: the country has been in a state of chaos for 17 years now, which guarantees Somalis automatic refugee recognition wherever they go.  And most seem to gravitate to wherever Nordic peoples may be found - Sweden, Denmark, Minnesota, etc.  It&rsquo;s a clever scam they have running, really.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Christian Arabs are generally not too problematic. It&rsquo;s Muslims that are the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually they are just as bad as the muslim arabs, the syrians in Södertälje has a quite bad reputation. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s far easier to have a sickeningly leftist welfare state when the numbers of Third Worlders is very low. But once they start moving in, the majority population starts to move to the right.</p>
<p>For instance, Minnesota. It also has admitted twice or thrice the number of Third World refugees as Sweden, and also has attracted some American blacks. It was notoriously liberal in the 1960s, but now is a purple state. It issues concealed carry permits, and has congressmen on the Immigration Reform Caucus. Its Republican governor Tim Pawlenty even survived the 2006 elections&hellip; and his coming out against amnesty for illegal aliens probably saved him, given the margin he won by. And when I lived there recently, I saw very few of the local women with the dusky invaders.</p>
<p><i>A couple of my friends in high school were Arab-Americans but they were both Christian. One was Lebanese and the other was Palestinian. Christian Arabs are generally not too problematic. It&rsquo;s Muslims that are the problem.</i></p>
<p>Arab Christians are more likely to identify with European cultures. Especially the Lebanese. The Muslims will naturally identify with Muslim cultures, which are diametrically opposed to European Christian cultures.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We have always had this conflict in our society between the frontier-guarding attitude and a more human rights attitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a choice between sovereignty or being morally correct.  </p>
<p>A &#8216;human rights attitude&rsquo;?  It&rsquo;s not a human right to invade and occupy Sweden.  What rubbish.  And this from a &#8220;journalist turned academic&#8221;.  These people, like Gunnar Myrdal, are responsible for this sickness.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Despite severe criticism from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees earlier this month,&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What GALL! Who the h*ll is the UN to DICTATE to Sweden anything? Note that the UN doesn&rsquo;t make such demands of any countries other than WHITE countries. Somalia, nor any other African country is Sweden&rsquo;s responsibility. Sweden can send financial aid to resettle African refugees in AFRICA, which is a far vaster region (comprising dozens of countries) than is tiny Sweden. This way MORE African refugees can be helped since it is a lot cheaper and easier to resettle African refugees in other African countries than to transport and resettle them in far away Sweden. And this way Sweden also does not irreversibly commit racial, ethnic, and cultural suicide. <br>
The fact that more African refugees could be helped by resettling them in Africa rather than in Sweden, but, nonetheless the Leftists INSIST instead on resettling them at far greater expense in Sweden, PROVES that the Leftists&rsquo; motives are not to help the greatest number of African refugees but rather to ethnically cleanse and destroy yet another ethnic European peoples and culture: They are animated by genocidal HATE against any and all white European peoples or cultures.<br>

			<p><i>All have substantial populations of refugees &mdash; Somalis, Iraqis and Assyrians.</i></p>
<p>Iraq &amp; Somalia: these are places where ethnic Swedes have <i>never</i> been welcome, are not currently welcome, and probably won&rsquo;t be welcome in a million years. So why welcome them into your country? This is not asylum - this is invasion. Every country that has become multiethnic has responded by throwing its culture and traditions out the window, in order to show tolerance for the newcomer. Just look at how America has gotten rid of Christmas (as opposed to the commercial &#8220;Holidays&#8221;).</p>
<p><i>We rarely see the courts giving the benefit of the doubt. We see judgments that are simply incorrect under international law.</i></p>
<p>Show me the democratically-elected international body, and show me where the people of Sweden have consented to their rule. &#8220;International Law&#8221;? There&rsquo;s no such animal.</p>

			<p>Yeah Christian Arabs are just as bad Muslims. Arabs are Arabs and its embarassing to see statements on amren discriminating on the basis of religion. Trust me I live in area with plenty of Arabs and they are all objectionable.<br>
Sweden a country I know all too well has changed dramatically in the past ten years, more so than any other country. The problem is that Swedes are very docile. Strong group think dictated by the government, they voluntarily lived under the socialist dictatorship of Olof Palme. They are starting to become uneasy at the influx of immigrants but we will see. There is a reason they always come bottom of European attitudes to immigration where as my country (GB) comes top. Me thinks it will take outside intervention.<br>
P.S. The best book on Sweden is Roland Huntford&rsquo;s &#8216;The New Totalitarians&rsquo;.</p>

<p>So tell us, good man, just why <i>do</i> they go to Sweden, then?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they go to Chad or Mali or somewhere closer to home and racially and culturally more similar?  Eh?</p>

			<p>I hope ethnic Swedes can recapture some of their ancestral Vikings&rsquo; attitudes towards intruders and then go kick some serious butt! Reading about what&rsquo;s happened to Malmo - where a huge chunk of third-world Swedish &#8216;refugees&rsquo; has settled - is horrifying. It&rsquo;s quite apparent that these &#8216;refugees&rsquo; are out to destroy Sweden. I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that most refugees are people who destroyed their own third-world countries, then claimed sanctuary in first-world nations once they were either hounded out or couldn&rsquo;t stand any more of the mess they&rsquo;d made. Now they want to do the same to first-world nations. Civilization is doomed if this trend continues.</p>

			<p>What we have today is a limitless number of irresponsible overpopulating third-world primitives competing with the population stabilizing industrialized nations for a finite amount of global resources.  This scenario provides the West with the justification to utilize warfare to reduce the populations of third-world countries that are hostile to Western ideals and who desire to conquer the West by dropping their population bomb and obliterating us all&hellip;  </p>

			<p><i>Trust me I live in area with plenty of Arabs and they are all objectionable.</i></p>
<p>Since the overwhelming majority of Arabs are Muslims, they are probably not Christians. </p>
<p>Even if an Arab clams to be Christian, they&rsquo;re as likely as not lying. I know this because I was told so by a Christian Jordanian shopkeeper whose store I used to shop at. At that time we were getting a large influx of Iraqi refugees (thanks, Bush) and I worked with one of these Iraqis who claimed to be a Christian. One day we sat down to lunch. He had bought a bucket of fried chicken and offered me some. It would&rsquo;ve been rude to refuse, so of course I took a piece. I then offered him some of the pork rinds I happened to have, but he absolutely refused to touch them. Anyway, I related this anecdote to the shopkeeper after work and he told me that all these people lie about being Christian because they know that this is a Christian country and the mood is real ugly over 9/11. </p>

			<p>Dont believe it. The &#8220;center-right&#8221; government makes Obama look like a conservative. And the Sweden democrats (a good party) are still seen by most Swedes as Fascists and are routinely attacked by the left wing thugs and &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; known as ANTIFA. While this may sound good, Sweden is far,far, far from doing what it needs to do.</p>

			<p>Can anyone tell me why these refugees/immigrants from Asia, Africa, Central America and the Middle East are not forced to fix their own Countries?</p>
<p>If Europe and America keeps allowing these people to invade us, we will simply turn into the very Countries these people came from.  Duh!  Why is that so hard to understand?  </p>
<p>QWERTY:</p>
<p>The whole arab, african, muslim, indian (dot)-American thing is what has killed America.  If you and your friends want to be something-American, you need to live wherever it is you call yourself first.  That is where your loyalty lies.  Anyone who puts something in front of American is not American at all.  America is full and we only have room for AMERICANS.</p>

			<p>&#8220;For instance, Minnesota. It also has admitted twice or thrice the number of Third World refugees as Sweden, and also has attracted some American blacks. It was notoriously liberal in the 1960s, but now is a purple state. It issues concealed carry permits, and has congressmen on the Immigration Reform Caucus. Its Republican governor Tim Pawlenty even survived the 2006 elections&hellip; and his coming out against amnesty for illegal aliens probably saved him, given the margin he won by. And when I lived there recently, I saw very few of the local women with the dusky invaders.&#8221;   &mdash;   Brendan</p>
<p>Brendan, tell me where and when you have ever met conservatives in Minnesota.  From what I have experienced in Minnesota, it was almost all hedonistic women chasing after the duskies.  Minnesota was probably the most liberal state not located on the West Coast that I have ever been to in my life.  The Twin Cities were loaded with homosexuals and radical multiculturalists at every corner.</p>
<p>If one considers Jessey Ventura to be a conservative, then I guess it may be changing in some aspects to what you have mentioned.</p>

			<p>Well I hope this may be a sign that the tide may be turning in Sweden.</p>
<p>However &#8220;integration&#8221; is the last thing Sweden needs. Much better to keep the unassimilable immigrants confined to as few locations as possible and in that way they will have the least impact on the Swedish way of life. If they are spread out all over the country it will simply create more problems and the solution (sending them back) will be more difficult when the day comes, due to mixed marriages, Swedish-Arab children etc. Much better to keep them non-integrated.</p>

			<p>I was in the Malmo/Lund area about 4 years ago. While living in Sweden, I met 1 (one) Swede- a girl of 16 who had chlamydia from sexual promiscuity, and said she, &#8220;&hellip;didn&rsquo;t ever want children&#8221;. The rest were a mixture of Middle Eastern, African and ethnic Albanians. The was also an ex-pat Englishman or two. </p>
<p>But just WHY is it Sweden&rsquo;s DUTY to import anyone for any reason-especialy countries like Somalia or Iraq or Sudan that have little historical relation and no cultural or racial similarity? Who said this is ANY Western country&rsquo;s obligation?</p>
<p>Integration? (lol). This is almost comedic. Dispersion? Yeah, all the small town communities will LOVE a couple of thousand Somalis dumped in their front yard. The madness continues and never stops. It will only stop when the elites whos madness this is are destroyed, either by patriots or by their replacements- the Muslims (in Europe), or the Mexicans and Blacks in the USA. </p>

			<p>Christian &#8220;Arabs&#8221; are not always the same as muslim ones.  Arab societies have all kinds of tribal and caste like groups, that are largely separate genetically(ie they don&rsquo;t intermarry).  I&rsquo;m sure we all know this now after following the war in Iraq. </p>
<p>The Christians generally trace descent from the pre-Islamic(ie non-Arab) populations while the muslims are a mix of indigenous people, Arab conquerers and African slaves.</p>

<p>Is that the same Mona Sahlin that at first simply declared Swedes not having any particular culture or ethnicity and then told the same Swedes to appreciate and learn values of cultural ethnic identity that are found among immigrants? The same Mona Sahlin who with her head demurely covered waxed poetical in the mosque about the positive influence of Islam? </p>

<p>Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a beautiful country, a cradle of European culture. On the other hand, I wouldn&rsquo;t much cry for Sweden - they work on their own destruction much more intensively than the French. French at least hoped to assimilate the immigrants on an equal-citizen basis, while Swedes swallowed that multiculti minority worship hook and sink.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Christian Arabs are generally not too problematic. It&rsquo;s Muslims that are the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are very wrong I&rsquo;m afraid. Most Christians from the Middle East are just as much trouble in Sweden and elsewhere in civilised white nations as the muslims from the same region are. It is not really a religious issue, it is first and foremost a race issue. Race is by far the most important factor of all in the long term and large scale perspective. If the whites of Northern Europe are mixed with non-whites the quality of the population, the human stock, will inevitably decline. Society and civilisation will deteriorate. There is no way around this. You can not maintain a civilised white society unless you have a racially homogenous white population of reasonable quality. Just look at the rapidly declining state of affairs in the US&hellip;</p>

			<p>I have loaned books to a Jordanian Moslem, an Iranian Jew, and to two Armenians.  One of the Armenians, who was half Russian, returned the book willingly.  The Iranian Jew did so when I pointed out that he was breaking the Commandment against stealing, and the two others just kept the book.  The whole Middle-Eastern culture condones stealing as far as I can see, Moslem, Christian, or Jew.  We don&rsquo;t need any of them in the West.  </p>
