						<p>The Dutch prosecutor&rsquo;s office is preparing to take legal action against the maker of an &lsquo;anti-Koran&rsquo; film in an attempt to ease tensions over the film&rsquo;s release, the Dutch foreign minister said on Monday.</p>
<p>Maxime Verhagen told ambassadors from 26 Muslim that he was happy with the relatively calm reaction he had witnessed since the short film was posted on sites Thursday by Dutch MP Geert Wilders, adding that the film in no way reflected the religious views of the Dutch government.</p>
<p>The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday that &#8220;Russia .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fully condemns the showing of the film and considers it a provocation,&#8221; warning of negative consequences similar to those that occurred, following the notorious Danish &lsquo;cartoon&rsquo; episode in 2006.</p>
<p>The 16-minute film, entitled &lsquo;Fitna&rsquo; &mdash; an Arabic word meaning &lsquo;strife&rsquo; or &lsquo;division among people&rsquo; &mdash; was posted on the U.K.-based video website Liveleak on Thursday evening. It was made by Dutch MP Geert Wilders, who had earlier announced that his film would show that the Koran is &#8220;a fascist book&#8221; that justifies murder.</p>
<p>The short film begins with an image of the notorious 2006 Danish cartoon portraying the Prophet Mohammed with an explosive device on his head. The cartoon caused riots throughout the world after demonstrators attacked Danish embassies and other buildings with perceived links to the West. More than 100 people died in the violence. There were also protests against the reprinting of the cartoon in 2008.</p>
<p>Both NATO and the EU had earlier expressed concern over the film, with NATO saying it feared that Dutch troops in Afghanistan would now become a target for &lsquo;revenge&rsquo; attacks. The Dutch government has also raised its national terrorist warning level in response to the film&rsquo;s release.</p>
<p>The film contains footage of radical Imams calling for the slaughter of Jews and other disbelievers as well as a Muslim holding a &#8220;God bless Hitler&#8221; placard. However, although the intention of the film was to &lsquo;discredit&rsquo; Islam by showing the links between verses in the Koran and violence, many commentators have suggested that the film resembles nothing more than the clips frequently aired on radical Islamic websites.</p>
<p>Although moderate Islamic groups have said the film is &#8220;nothing new&#8221; and have made appeals for Muslims to &#8220;react calmly and within the law,&#8221; the prospect of a backlash in the Islamic world remains a distinct possibility.<br>

			<p>The only reason I know that this story isn&rsquo;t speaking of an Islamic country is that Geert Wilders has not yet been beheaded.  Otherwise, one could easily think that the Netherlands is an Islamic Sharia Law country.</p>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t Western governments and all of these phantom &#8216;moderate Muslims&rsquo; spend more time condemning terrorists and their actions instead of a democratically elected Dutch representative exercises his basic human right of freedom of expression? Contemporary Western governments are a disgrace to our civilization.</p>

			<p>So if you dont like the message, you shoot the messenger!<br>
Surely the Dutch prosecutor should be focussed on charging people who turn to violence instead!<br>
The Dutch are losing the plot.<br>
What they are saying to Islam is &#8220;we surrender&#8221;.</p>

<p>Taking action against someone who reveals a legitimate threat is the answer to easing tensions?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it moronic to worry that criminals might get mad if they<br>
are exposed?</p>
<p>This dork is just begging to get his come uppance on the issue. <br>

			<p>This film is completely tame and its contents genuine.  The video images are REAL, the extracts from the Kor&rsquo;an calling for violent repression and bloodletting against all nonMuslims are REAL, the hate preaching clerics are REAL and the accounts of religious atrocities are REAL.</p>
<p>There is only one way to deal with Islam - outlaw it and impose immediate deportation upon all Third Worlders who would dare to continue its practice in the West. </p>
<p>Indigenous converts should be presented with the choices of abandoning the cult or spending life imprisonment. </p>
<p>In reality, the return of the death penalty for Treason would go a long way towards eradicating a good many of its practitioners.</p>
<p>In passing, I am disgusted with the spokesman from Russia.  </p>
<p>Is Russia now in the business of also aiding and abetting the criminal Cult of Islam?  Another nest of vipers guilty of the crime of Treason too, it seems.  Let the Russian people take care of this swine!<br>

			<p>Europe will never assimilate millions of Muslims into European society.<br>
The genetic factors and cultural differences of millions of Muslims on European soil is enough impact to raise the sword of El Cid.<br>
The Middle East must kneel before White leaders and learn to seperate God vision from base genetic acts.<br>
Only White American men have the magic to remove the Sword in the Stone to unlock human potential and envision the rights within all under the guide of the Constitution.<br>
The threat of court room action shows how much Europe is hog tied under its own constricting politics.<br>
Let that be a lesson to them.</p>

			<p>The film is extremely tame. All it does is showcases Muslims themselves. And lets them speak for themselves.<br>
Why is it OK for Muslims to say these things, but if you record it and play it back to the public then you are engaging in &#8220;anti-Muslim&#8221; hate?<br>
We live in a bizarro world in which condemning Islamic hate makes YOU guilty of &#8220;hate&#8221;!<br>
The indigenous peoples of the West must REVOLT against their Leftist &#8220;leaders&#8221; who are selling them out.</p>

			<p>Geert Wilders has shown great courage in standing up to the Islamic terrorists and the PC multi cult appeasers. Everyone on this forum should do something to support this spark of courage for our people, for freedom.</p>
<p>We made our own video on the same subject. We think it is better than Geert Wilders&rsquo; film, but his is very good.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n731ujoR2Q" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n731ujoR2Q</a></p>
<p>Never apologize for noting the violent, hateful, cowardly Islamic terrorist attacks against our people, our culture.</p>
<p>Any time you ever see some ugly Muslim trying to get you or some other WHite western person to &#8220;apologize&#8221;, you should turn around and say:</p>
<p>NO - you are the ones who should apologize. Your people did the 9/11/01, the London and Madrid bombings. You are in the wrong, not us.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t like Western freedom - fine, there is the door and don&rsquo;t slam the door on the way out.</p>
<p>Go set up some rip off White Hen pantries in Mecca or some cave in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Resist, don&rsquo;t surrender.</p>

True enough.   Europe will never assimilate them.   But THEY will absorb Europe into THEIR society. That is the plan.</p>
<p>================</p>
<p>&#8220;The film begins with an image of the notorious 2006 Danish cartoon portraying the Prophet Mohammed with an explosive device on his head. The cartoon caused riots throughout the world after demonstrators attacked Danish embassies&hellip;. More than 100 people died in the violence.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
Moslems violent?  What?  Are you kidding?   What utter nonsense!  That&rsquo;s outrageous.  Everyone knows that Islam is the religion of peace.  And if anyone disagrees with that, we&rsquo;ll  kill him. (It&rsquo;s not murder. It&rsquo;s just performing a religious act, that&rsquo;s all.)</p>
<p>BOTTOM LINE: ISLAM IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE WEST.</p>

			<p>The same climate that was created to assassinate Pim Fortuyn and resulted in the slaughter of Theo van Gogh is now in the air for Geert Wilders. They called me crazy years ago when I made the predictions that things like this were going to happen in the Netherlands. The totalitarian left rules with an iron fist and this is the result&hellip;.Job Cohen the mayor of Amsterdam is giving orders to brainwash school children that Geert Wilders is a danger while he constantly having tea parties with the radical imams to keep the peace&hellip;..they called me crazy but I am lucky to have jumped the gun of sharia law which is already in effect.</p>
<p>I thank God for the United States of America&hellip;. </p>

<p>Geert Wilders is the Dutch&rsquo;s William Tell.</p>
<p>Where are the heirs of Kuyper, Bavinck, and the lights of the Dutch Calvinist Reformation? It&rsquo;s time for a renaissance of Theonomy in Holland&hellip;&hellip;</p>
