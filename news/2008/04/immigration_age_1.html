						<p>Federal immigration agents raided Pilgrim&rsquo;s Pride poultry plants in five states Wednesday in a crackdown on an alleged scam to provide fake identification for illegal immigrant workers, authorities said.</p>
<p>More than 100 people were expected to be charged in the raids at the nation&rsquo;s largest chicken producer, Julie Myers, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement assistant secretary, told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>&#8220;Identity theft is a horrible problem that can ruin a person&rsquo;s good name,&#8221; Myers said.</p>
<p>The raids were part of a long-term investigation, officials said. Plants were raided in Mount Pleasant, Texas, Batesville, Ark., Live Oak, Fla., Chattanooga, Tenn. and Moorefield, W.Va., authorities said.</p>
<p>Ray Atkinson, a spokesman for Pittsburg, Texas-based Pilgrim&rsquo;s Pride, said the company went to ICE agents with information about identity theft at the Arkansas plant. Atkinson said the company uses a federal database to check identity documents of new employees, but that wouldn&rsquo;t stop a person from using a real, but stolen ID.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The poultry raids were the largest of several immigration enforcement actions taken across the country Wednesday.</p>
<p>Agents arrived before dawn at a Houston doughnut plant and arrested almost 30 workers suspected of being in the country illegally. Robert Rutt, the agent in charge of the Houston ICE office, told the Houston Chronicle some of the people arrested lived at the Shipley Do-Nuts dough factory, a four-block plant that includes a dormitory for workers.</p>
<p>In Buffalo, N.Y., federal law enforcement officials announced the arrest of a local businessman and 10 associates accused of employing illegal Mexican immigrants in seven restaurants in four states.</p>
<p>Authorities also arrested 45 illegal immigrants during the early morning raids in western New York, Bradford, Pa.; Mentor, Ohio; Wheeling and New Martinsville, W.Va., and Georgia.</p>

			<p>On question&hellip;..why in the world would any business hire any mexican in the first place?????? Please do not insult our intellegance on Amren with&hellip;.we didn&rsquo;t know&hellip;.stupid stupid stupid&hellip;..we all know why they hire them&hellip;to pay low wages and make big profits &hellip;and every single business that does this&hellip;.should be fined and I mean big fines&hellip;.$10,000 for ever SINGLE ILLEGAL THEY HIRE&hellip;what they should be doing is callin ICE when any of these mexicans come around.  I saw four in our Walmart&hellip;.not far from were I live, they were trying some scam about returning something to the store, which they probably stole from some other walmart&hellip;.as soon as the clerk said no way, you dont have proper ID&hellip;.they got out of that store in a big hurry&hellip;if I wouldn&rsquo;t have had to wait for my girlfriend to check out&hellip;.I would have followed them out the door to see if they had a car and if so get the liscense plate and report them to the state cops and say I just saw a car load of illegals&hellip;.next time I won&rsquo;t wait I will get the plate number and make that call!!</p>

			<p>I must be missing something. The company not only cooperated, but initiated the contact with ICE. This is so very admirable, so right, that I am stunned. I still expect to be let down by the real story tomorrow, but if not, Pilgrim&rsquo;s Pride is my new brand.</p>

			<p>Wow, the Feds round up 100 illegals while millions are coming in per year.  These 100 will probabally be ordered released by judges.</p>

			<p>The Mexicans have taken over Mt. Pleasant, TX and it&rsquo;s all thru Beau Pilgrim. All he hires is Mexicans. It is a 500 Co. he has connections and probably got a high sign from a politician. <br>
What they&rsquo;ve done to that town is shameful, houses painted hideous colors. It&rsquo;s dangerous to drive there and none of them are insured. If they&rsquo;re caught they just re-arrange their name. We call it Mt. Mexico&hellip;.</p>

			<p>Now, fellas, let&rsquo;s read a little closer, before we start pattin&rsquo; these guys on the back for&#8221; cooperating&#8221;. There was a mention of 10 arrests locally. Ya don&rsquo;t rekun they wuz sceered now do ya? I&rsquo;m sure this tactic will be axed, by the liberals running the show, in the soon to be United states of Amerexico.</p>

			<p>I wonder if the illegals were trying to form a union? That is usually the only time a company acts.</p>

			<p>I didn&rsquo;t see this article in the MSM either. I guess they just can&rsquo;t publish articles about companies obeying immigration laws too broadly. Anyway, good for Pilgrim&rsquo;s Pride. I&rsquo;ll definately start looking for their products in the store. <br>

			<p>Corporations have broken the contract they once had with the American worker. Multinational corporations now leverage our government, at the expense of the national interest, for short-term shareholder profit rather than our government managing the economy properly in the interests of American business owners. 100 illegals solves nothing. We have 20 million of them roaming the country at will right now.</p>
