<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A majority of Canadians say their country bends too much in trying to make visible minorities feel at home, even as voters pat themselves on the back for being a welcoming society.</p>
<p>Results of a new survey for The Globe and Mail/CTV News also show substantial national fault lines on immigration, with urban Canadians more likely to support the growth of visible minority groups than their rural cousins are.</p>
<p>According to the poll, 61 per cent of those surveyed believe that Canada makes too many accommodations for visible minorities. In Quebec, 72 per cent of those surveyed feel that way.</p>
<p>At the same time, 88 per cent of Canadians believe that their community is welcoming to members of visible minority groups.</p>
<p>As the Conservatives move to amend Canadian immigration laws to clear a backlog, the party&rsquo;s base is apparently less positive about the increasing numbers of newcomers who call themselves visible minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, there&rsquo;s a bit of self-satisfaction in terms of our record,&#8221; said Peter Donolo, a partner with the polling firm the Strategic Counsel. &#8220;But there&rsquo;s also this kind of anxiety that&rsquo;s most pronounced in certain groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Donolo said some of the unease might stem from a spate of recent issues.</p>
<p>They include whether Islamic sharia law should be recognized and a Tory proposal during last year&rsquo;s Ontario election to extend public funding to all faith-based schools.</p>
<p>In Quebec, the government called public hearings into the &#8220;reasonable accommodation&#8221; of immigrants.</p>
<p>The poll also found that 45 per cent of those surveyed believe new Canadians hold on to their customs and traditions for too long, only two percentage points below those who feel newcomers integrate into Canadian life at a natural and acceptable pace.</p>
<p>Mr. Donolo noted there were substantial differences among Canadians on the issue, depending on their age, their education, the size of their community and other factors.</p>
<p>For example, on the matter of whether accepting new immigrants of diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds is an enriching part of the Canadian identity, 65 per cent living in cities of more than one million agreed, compared with 53 per cent of Canadians in communities of fewer than 30,000.</p>
<p>And on the matter of whether new Canadians hold on to their customs for too long, 54 per cent in small communities said they felt they did, while 42 per cent in the large centres said they did not.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who tend to feel strongest about this are people who live in the smaller communities, where there would be less contact with members of minorities,&#8221; said Mr. Donolo. &#8220;Whereas, the intensity of this feeling is much reduced in larger communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supporters of different political parties also had differing views.</p>
<p>When asked to characterize the fact that five million Canadians are visible minorities, 55 per cent of Liberal supporters said it was a positive development, compared with 38 per cent of Conservative backers.</p>
<p>By contrast, 53 per cent of NDP backers, 56 per cent of Bloc Québécois backers and 59 per cent of Greens found the numbers a good thing.</p>
<p>Asked whether, at 16 per cent, visible minorities make up too much of the nation&rsquo;s population, 55 per cent of Canadians said it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Only 9 per cent said the proportion was too large, while 10 per cent said it was too small.</p>
<p>Mr. Donolo said some of the poll&rsquo;s results might help to explain policy decisions made by various governments.</p>
<p>For example, the Conservative initiative to ban face veils at voting booths may stem from the fact that 82 per cent of Bloc Québécois voters believe the country has yielded too much in making accommodations.</p>
<p>&#8220;They understand that there&rsquo;s some potential, particularly with switching Bloc voters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At the same time, though, they have to be on guard because there&rsquo;s a history or tendency of the media to brand them as outside the mainstream on these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Conservatives want to grow their base, and have made efforts to court visible minorities.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,000 Canadians was conducted from last Thursday to Sunday, and is accurate to within 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.<br>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize people of color made up 39 percent of all Canadians already. I bet this is a survey of those in big cities.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure most Canadians feel &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are treated better then native Canadians. Leftists, however, never care about what the majority wants? Keep voting for them Canadians. You will soon be third class citizens. </p>

			<p>If these idiots up north feel this way, why do they continue to put the same multicultural politicians in power?  They need WAY more minority problems before they&rsquo;re going to face up to reality in Canada.</p>

<p>Wrong!  Canadians in large cities such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver are already facing up to the realities/problems of Third World immigration, but the rest of Canada is still quite white.  </p>
<p>Also, why do we, here in America, keep voting for Liberal open-border politicians since we&rsquo;ve been absolutely swamped with Third World immigration?  Unfortunately, we&rsquo;re not given any real choice!  Our candidates were all selected by the corporations, and none of them will be good for America!  We should be demanding some better options!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you&rsquo;re right about the coddling part, much to my chagrin, but remember this is a marxist-led trait where &#8220;political-correctness&#8221; has been indoctrinated into the masses. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to engage in honest conversations with other Canadians, because we don&rsquo;t have much in relation to &#8220;first amendment rights&#8221; to free speech. That sovereign right has been usurped with hate laws, human rights tribunals, etc.  We&rsquo;re also razzle-dazzled with the &#8216;bread &amp; circus&rsquo; games as those south of the 49th parallel, so few people have enough knowledge for an intelligent opinion on mass 3rd world immigration.</p>
<p>Recent statistics just released show <i>White Canadians</i> are now down to 84%&hellip;that&rsquo;s a drop from 86.5% in only five years. Canada now has 5,000,000 people described as visible-minorities thanks to immigrants from other countries unlike ourselves.</p>
<p>In comparison to U.S. figures, I believe the figure is only 67% White or 100,000,000 NON-white out of a total 300 million residents.</p>
<p>Instead, I prefer having White Americans &#8220;pouring&#8221; over <i>our</i> side of the border in &#8220;droves&#8221; to off-set those &#8220;others&#8221; that are slowly eroding our own established heritage.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it may not make any difference in a few years, if they&rsquo;re successful in erasing the borders of Mexico, U.S. &amp; Canada and proceed with their <b>North American Union</b> plans.</p>

			<p>For a model as to what will probably happen to the U.S. as a result of multiculturalism, read the book by Thomas Chittom &#8220;Civil War II: The Balkanization of America&#8221;. He makes an observation that is true of the U.S. now: those nations in which the inhabitants are of the same racial/ethnic group are intrinsically MUCH more stable (and without internal problems) than those with more racially diverse populations. </p>
<p>As the Hispanic population continues to grow, our population will continue to get more and more unstable until balkanization eventually occurs. Google: Altzan.</p>

			<p>Xenophon, as in most Western countries, there is NO sane political party to choose. Every one, the liberals and the pseudo conservatives, are in support of immigration and multiracialism/multiculturalism. The only option is a a revolutionary movement to establish a completely new and independent party. And this will not happen unless the people have suffered enough to do something about it. The human race, including the Whites, have a tendency to compromise and settle for less as long as it&rsquo;s possible.</p>

			<p>I live in a Canadian city, and I find that young adults I know are starting to notice how their neighborhoods are changing.  </p>
<p>Most go along with the status quo, which taught them to never have negative thoughts about immigrants.  Once you show them it&rsquo;s alright to view immigrants critically, the latent thoughts come out. </p>
<p>In my circle of friends, we all are opposed to the encroachments of non-Westerners into our country. </p>

			<p>Xenophon; Us idiots, up north, keep voting for the same multicultural politicians, because every political party is the same when it comes to immigration, diversity, and multiculturalism. So, now that we know who us idiots up north vote for, who will you be voting for, Clinton, McCain, or Obama?</p>

<p>I plan on voting for the least qualified politician in the hope that he is so bad that whites will lose faith in government.  That&rsquo;s the only logical way out at the moment.

<p>Please, Xenophon.  As an US-born guy, I always looked to Canada as being the last bastion of North American homogeneity.  It pains me to see the same thing happening to them that has happened here.  So, why the name calling?  I thought this site was supposed to bring together people who are tired of suspending their disbelief&hellip;not drive wedges between them.</p>

			<p>Who runs Canada? The same cabal that runs America? Sounds like it. Just like all the rest of the White nations that have been invaded with nonwhites. There is a REASON for this, you know. When we wake up to that fact, then MAYBE we will do something about it.</p>

			<p>The Cabal that runs Canada, the US, and Western Civilization is the Illuminati, comprised of the global elites (Rothschilds, Rockefellers, etc.) who have pulled the world&rsquo;s strings for a few centuries now. What has yet to be understood is WHY they&rsquo;ve orchestrated this sudden massive third world immigration into White societies. For what reason is this entire calamity being visited upon us? To dominate us all after having turned the masses into mindless, dependent, micro-chipped sheep?</p>

			<p>Most White Canadians (it shames me to say) are still terrified of being called The Worst Thing In The World, ie: a &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Most European descended Canadians are politicaly illiterate, and therefore vote, unwittingly, against their own interests.</p>
<p>At the same time, most of them probably feel a growing unease, a (for now) nameless fear, at what is happening to their country. But they don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s happening. And they are too afraid to say anything. And therefore, their destruction continues apace</p>
