						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the past three weeks, a network of about 30 black women bloggers have been blistering Sharpton and the local NAACP for coddling the black teenagers accused taking a neighborhood woman at gunpoint into her West Palm Beach home, raping her and forcing her to have sex with her own pre-teen son.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Sharpton stood in front of the Palm Beach County State Attorney&rsquo;s Office with local NAACP officials and relatives of the accused Dunbar Village rapists to complain that these teenage boys are victims of racial discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Tonyaa Weathersbee] and other politically active black women bloggers say Sharpton has ignored the indisputable victims in the Dunbar case &mdash; a 35-year-old black woman and her 12-year-old son.</p>
<p>Maude Ford Lee, the president of the West Palm Beach NAACP chapter, spoke alongside Sharpton while the assembled media were handed a flier showing the photos of three of the accused Dunbar Village rapists with the words, &#8220;Voiceless, Vulnerable, Victims!!&#8221; next to them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Sharpton had the victims wrong</b></p>
<p>The gist of the racial discrimination complaint was that the Dunbar teenagers were being held without bond while a group of white teenagers from suburban Boca Raton charged with rape earlier this year were free on bond.</p>
<p>In the suburban Boca Raton case, the teens were accused of getting two neighborhood friends drunk and then raping them while they were too drunk to resist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fenton [Arlene Fenton, a blogger] organized a letter-writing campaign against the local NAACP, Sharpton and his National Action Network for using the west Boca case to make victims of the Dunbar Village teenagers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is breathtaking that the National Action Network brain trust can&rsquo;t seem to comprehend the difference between a home invasion by masked gunmen who torture, rape, sodomize, cut, burn, and beat their victims for THREE HOURS and culminate the event with crime against nature committed against a 12-year-old child .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and a case involving NONE of those facts,&#8221; Fenton wrote.</p>
<p><b>Bloggers see victory</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The women bloggers take all this backpedaling as a victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let this be the alarm for any man, woman or organization that decides to align itself with those who harm Black women and children &mdash; today is a new day,&#8221; blogged Tanisha Mathis. &#8220;Today is the day you realize we are an omnipresent force to be reckoned with and respected.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The title of this article tries to hide the racial aspect of the bloggers.</p>
<p>The black bloggers said:&#8221;Let this be the alarm for any man, woman or organization that decides to align itself with those who harm <b>Black</b> women and children &mdash; today is a new day&#8221;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>politically active <b>black women bloggers</b> say Sharpton has ignored the indisputable victims in the Dunbar case &mdash; a 35-year-old <b>black</b> woman and her 12-year-old son.</p>
<p>I will give the women credit for this though:&ldquo;It is breathtaking that the National Action Network brain trust can&rsquo;t seem to comprehend the difference between a home invasion by masked gunmen who torture, rape, sodomize, cut, burn, and beat their victims for THREE HOURS and culminate the event with crime against nature committed against a 12-year-old child &hellip; and a case involving NONE of those facts,&rdquo; Fenton wrote.</p>
<p>Nicely stated.  Yes, Sharpton and the NAACP often miss or omit such glaring differences.  But truch be told, the black bloggers are only pointing out these differences and rebuking Sharpton because the victims are black.</p>

			<p>Ridiculous.  The white &#8216;rapists&rsquo; are hardly even rapists, while the black rapist did the most horrible things he could imagine out of sheer cruelty.  Of course they were treated differently.</p>

			<p>I assume that if the victims had been white there would have been no objection on the part of the bloggers.<br>
As whites continue to suffer as victims of black violence, there will hopefully come a day when they decide as a group to actually resist; until that day the black wolves will have their day with all the white sheep.</p>

<p> Sir<br>
 I regret to inform you that after 40 years of affirmative action, waging war on the white race, rewriting all the history books,spending trillions on blacks and other minorities and denigrating every white institution that ever existed. The Federal Government will never allow the white race to ever stand against the juggernaut that they and the Illuminata have put together for the eventual destruction of the white race.</p>

			<p>Google Genarlow Wilson and there are over 15,000 hits with almost all defending the horrific sex crime as consensual sex between teens.  The girls were 17 and 15, and black.  There is a video tape.  </p>
<p><br>
The following is from: </p>
<p>A different view on &#8216;07 Newsmaker<br>
Reader says media played along with attorney&rsquo;s portrayal of Genarlow Wilson as victim of callous prosecutors<br>
By William J. Atkins, Special to the Daily Report </p>
<p>The videotape, portions of which I have seen, was &ldquo;Exhibit A&rdquo; because it depicts a horrific crime: a gang rape of a semi-conscious, 17-year-old girl, followed by a bizarre display of sexual precociousness by a 15-year-old girl. That&rsquo;s the truth recorded by Genarlow and his friends that fateful night. I suspect that is also why Ms. Bernstein hated it whenever McDade used it to rebut her version of Genarlow&rsquo;s crime. <br>
No matter how much (two glasses of Cognac) the 17-year-old may have had to drink, no matter how much she may have flirted with those boys, she did not consent to having sex with all of them, one right after the other. Yet it never occurred to the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; and &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; Genarlow to say, &ldquo;Stop it. We should not be doing this.&rdquo; No. Genarlow watched, waited and gladly took his turn. When they were through raping her, Genarlow helped his friends drag the comatose victim to the bathroom. They opened the door, pushed her in, watched as she fell to the floor and closed the door. I guess she wasn&rsquo;t much fun anymore. <br>
The second victim, just 15 and apparently a bit shy about going all the way, lined the boys up for back-to-back oral sex sessions. It never occurred to the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; and &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; Genarlow to say, &ldquo;Fellas, this is wrong. She&rsquo;s pretty young, we&rsquo;re videotaping, this needs to stop right now.&rdquo; Nope. Genarlow watched, waited and gladly took his turn. Is it possible that she offered oral sex to those boys because she was afraid of suffering the same fate as her 17-year-old friend? <br>

<p>But this is Obama&rsquo;s take on the Wilson case:</p>
<p>7/12/2007 - 6:58 pm<br>
Senator Obama implies racism involved in Genarlow Wilson sentence<br>
Via the AP:<br>
(AP) Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama on Thursday derided President Bush&rsquo;s commutation of former White House aide I. Lewis &ldquo;Scooter&rdquo; Libby&rsquo;s prison term even as black men routinely serve time behind bars. <br>
All eight Democratic hopefuls and a lone Republican candidate, Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo, addressed the NAACP convention. The Democrats focused their criticism on the administration&rsquo;s record on race relations. <br>
&ldquo;We know we have more work to do when Scooter Libby gets no prison time and a 21-year-old honor student, who hadn&rsquo;t even committed a felony, gets 10 years in prison,&rdquo; Obama said to loud cheers. <br>
Aides said Obama was referring to Genarlow Wilson, a Georgia man serving a 10-year prison sentence for having consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was 17. A judge last month ordered Wilson to be freed, but prosecutors are blocking the order. </p>
<p>This is what Al Sharpton had to say:</p>
<p>Sharpton joins rally for Genarlow Wilson<br>
Hundreds of supporters of the man serving a 10-year sentence for having consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was 17 rallied for his freedom Thursday in Douglasville, Ga.<br>
The Rev. Al Sharpton made an appearance, embracing the mother and sister of Genarlow Wilson, who has been in prison for two years. &ldquo;This boy is not only her son, he&rsquo;s your son, he&rsquo;s my son,&rdquo; Sharpton said on the steps of the Douglas County Courthouse. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here today because what affects you affects all of us.&rdquo;<br>
State Rep. Alisha Thomas Morgan said Wilson&rsquo;s punishment was excessive and should be reduced, just like the prison sentence for former White House aide Lewis &ldquo;Scooter&rdquo; Libby, which was commuted Monday by President Bush. &ldquo;Genarlow is the face of many other young black men who have received injustice,&rdquo; Thomas Morgan said. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s got to stand up for them.&rdquo;<br>
Wilson, now 21, is serving a 10-year mandatory sentence for aggravated child molestation stemming from a 2003 New Year&rsquo;s Eve Party where he was captured on videotape receiving oral sex from a 15-year-old girl. The law has since been changed by Georgia lawmakers, but the state&rsquo;s top court said the new law could not be applied retroactively.</p>
<p>Here is what the NAACP said about Wilson:</p>
<p>GENARLOW WILSON FREED: NAACP Praises Georgia Supreme Court&rsquo;s order to Release Him.<br>
(October 26, 2007)</p>
<p>     NAACP officials are applauding the Georgia Supreme Court&rsquo;s order to release Genarlow Wilson from the Burruss Correctional Training Center.   <br>
     &#8220;Thank God that common sense, the will of the General Assembly and the popular opinion of most Georgians still has a place before the powers of government,&#8221; said Georgia NAACP State Conference President Edward O Dubose in reaction to the court&rsquo;s decision. &#8220;America&rsquo;s history is littered with instances when laws have been misused   &mdash;   their intended purposes subverted and lives destroyed. The NAACP monitors and intervenes when necessary because all too often the misuses of said laws are predicated by race or results in racial disparity.&#8221; <br>
     The court&rsquo;s 4-3 decision written by Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears determined that Gernarlow Wilson&rsquo;s sentence of 10 years imprisonment for having consensual sex with a 15-year old girl when he was 17 constitutes &#8220;cruel and unusual punishment.&#8221; Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker had appealed a Monroe Superior Court&rsquo;s grant of habeus corpus relief that would have freed Gernalow Wilson earlier this year. <br>
     Although the Georgia General Assembly changed the law since Wilson&rsquo;s conviction  &mdash;  to make similar acts a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of one year in prison  &mdash;  Wilson, now 21, has been incarcerated for more than two years.  <br>
     &#8220;For three years we&rsquo;ve been proclaiming to anyone that would hear that Genarlow Wilson&rsquo;s sentence was unjust, and today the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed our position,&#8221; said Kimberly Alexander, president of the West Metro NAACP Branch.  <br>
     The NAACP has been in the forefront of the case. The Douglas County and West Metro branches intervened on behalf of Wilson ad five other defendants when they were originally charged in 2003. In July 2006 the NAACP led the first march and rally of more than 3,000 in Douglas County to draw attention to the injustice and demand Wilson&rsquo;s release. <br>
     The Genarlow Wilson tragedy is another example in an alarming series of cases that demonstrates overly aggressive prosecution against African American youth. Wilson&rsquo;s case and countless other recent dehumanizing attacks led the NAACP to declare a &#8216;State of Emergency&rsquo; that requires immediate action by local and state authorities as well as the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Congress. The NAACP has called for hearings in Congress and every community around the nation in order to clearly understand the scope of this problem and most importantly craft viable solutions. To learn more go t www.naacp.org.<br>
     Founded in 1909, the NAACP is the nation&rsquo;s oldest and largest civil rights organization.  Its members throughout the United States and the world are the premier advocates for civil rights in their communities, conducting voter mobilization and monitoring equal opportunity in the public and private sectors.</p>

<p>The White rapists are &#8220;hardly &#8220;rapists&#8221;? Are you out of your mind?! How can you justify any sort of rape or attempted rape?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it works. Look how six blacks who beat Justin Barker into unconsciousness became the victims. Rodney King and OJ Simpson also spring to mind.</p>
<p>Turning the perpetrator into the victim is second nature to blacks.</p>

			<p>It seems like ol&rsquo; Al has a new, twisted, and evil media tactic. Defend violent black teenagers at all costs. Even if they are brutalizing black women and children. Perhaps he&rsquo;s hoping if he frees enough young violent simians or keeps them out of prison they will inevitably stop brutalizing their own and attack whites? What other reason could their be?  </p>

			<p>[Tonyaa Weathersbee] and other politically active black women bloggers say Sharpton has ignored the indisputable victims in the Dunbar case &mdash; a 35-year-old black woman and her 12-year-old son.</p>
<p><br>
No doubt it&rsquo;s true, and as usual Sharpton has sunk to new lows. Only I doubt any black bloggers would challange him had the victim been White. In fact, I fear few Whites would these days. But then again, such crimes are rarely even reported when the victim is White. MSM keeps it all hush hush.</p>
