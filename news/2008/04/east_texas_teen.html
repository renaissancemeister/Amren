						<p>Melanie Bowers, 13, and her parents walked into Athens High School Monday afternoon to talk to campus police. They were hoping to get some answers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It never should have happened in the first place. The whole assignment was a silly assignment and they should have contacted us immediately after it happened,&#8221; said J.R. Bowers, Melanie&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>It was an assignment for history class &mdash; to make a protest sign for or against an issue, and Melanie said she chose illegal immigration. Her sign read, &#8220;If you love our nation, stop illegal immigration.&#8221; Somehow, Melanie said the sign got passed around lunch and angered a group of Latino students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know any of these people,&#8221; she said. One young, she claimed, jumped on her back and he put her in a choke hold. &#8220;We have brick walls in the middle school and he slammed my face on the bricks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melanie said a group of boys also threatened to rape and kill her. Eventually, the boys let her go and when she went for help, she was ordered back to class, and told she could not call her parents, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Athens ISD gave KLTV 7 a statement, confirming there was a disturbance in the hallway, Friday between two to three students. &#8220;We have a camera system in the building,&#8221; said Louis DeRosa. &#8220;We are collecting other information and statements from witnesses and this is all the information we have at this time,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>If this situation had been reversed, the national guard would have been sent to the school.  If a group of white kids attacked and threatened to rape a non-white girl for her political views, it would be international news.  I hope the Bowers family files a lawsuit against the school.</p>

			<p>What type of country do we live in today? We know what the response of Russian men would be. What is the response of American men. Nothing. We sit on our butts and do nothing out of fear of being called Neo-Nazis. If defending our people and country gets us called neo-nazi than so be it.</p>

			<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appear that any white students came to this girl&rsquo;s defense (or the article would find a way to portray this as a white-on-minority hate crime).  And that, in my view, sums up why we&rsquo;re in such a perilous situation.</p>

			<p>This sounds like a hate crime to me.  My bet is that assignment was meant to provoke left-wing political activity, but Miss Bowers didn&rsquo;t get the message and mistakenly assumed that the First Amendment applies at school.</p>

<p>Someday   &mdash;   MAYBE   &mdash;   when our country has returned to some semblance of sanity, this brave young lady will get the recognition she deserves as a Civil Rights heroine. That&rsquo;s right, I said CIVIL RIGHTS HEROINE. </p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;It never should have happened in the first place. The whole assignment was a silly assignment and they should have contacted us immediately after it happened,&rdquo; said J.R. Bowers, Melanie&rsquo;s father.&#8221;</p>
<p>What should never have happened in the first place is the wholesale importation of TENS OF MILLIONS of mestizo Reconquistadors who are as dim-witted as they are hostile. The great state of Texas fought the Alamo for this? </p>
<p>Miss Melanie Bowers, you may be only 13 but you are my Rosa Parks. And Mr. Jared Taylor, you are my Martin Luther King. <br/>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any educational benefit to school kids from making protest signs in any class, but I am glad this girl had the backbone to stick it right in their faces. If only more middle-aged white men and women had the same type of fortitude. </p>

			<p>Living in Northwest Louisiana I have watched as East Texas becomes more Hispanic, and my concerns about this have now bee verified.  Driving out of Dallas and surfing through the radio stations used to come up with one Spanish language-only station 15 years ago. Now, there are at least 6 I know of.  Likewise, there used to be NONE beginning from Tyler on eastward, until now. I counted 3.  Tyler now has a bona fide Hispanic area which looks just like Juarez if you didn&rsquo;t know better.  15 years ago, nothing of the sort.  Longview is catching up with Tyler and Marshall is threatening.  So far, hardly any in NW Louisiana although I&rsquo;m seeing more every year.  But, this incident should dispell any silly notion about these people &#8220;just trying to make a living and becoming good Americans.&#8221; As has been proven time and again these people DO NOT care for our &#8216;Anglo&rsquo; culture, and as soon as their numbers are sufficient to make them feel comfortable the cockiness sets in and they pull something like this. Hispanics hate us, they don&rsquo;t want anything to do with us except take our money and jobs, and will brutalize us the first chance they get.  </p>

			<p>We will continue to lose our struggle against illegal immigration and an open border as long as there are so many brain dead white liberals among our ranks whose only response to the displacement and demise of our race is to smile and surrender.And liberals are not the only problem. Most of the race traitors among us are the ones who are willing to help the reconquistadors overtake us because they can make a lot of $ for themselves by it happening.</p>

			<p>Exactly why there should be an immediate end to birthright citizenship. An end to the magnets. Followed by aggressive, &#8216;gloves are off&rsquo;, deportation of absolutely every illegal alien, preferably to some distant continent. Most of all an end to politicians who aid and abet, and law enforcement that looks the other way. Zero tolerance for employers, zero tolerance for sanctuaries, zero federal aid to Mexico.</p>
<p>Hope the parents and their lawyers hang the school officials and the school board by their thumbs. First for refusing to assist the student who called on them for help, and second, for forcing her back into a very dangerous situation. Law enforcement can now prosecute the school officials for aiding and abetting a hate crime. Then prosecute the &#8216;youths&rsquo; and scrutinize their parents legal status real closely.</p>
<p>Every single one of these &#8216;hard working family folks with their Rio Grande values&rsquo; need to be expunged from society, repatriated with prejudice. No matter what Bush says, they are not first world material, never were, never will be, no matter how many generations pass.<br/>

			<p>Heh, good thing that for a female, I&rsquo;m physically imposing. I did a powerpoint presentation on British Imperialism in Africa that would have gotten me killed in a black school. Real history is wasted on these people anyway; if it doesn&rsquo;t show them as triumphant over the white devils, then the event is a myth that is now considered fact, or the text book authors are racist. It is a complete waste of everyone&rsquo;s time and money to teach anyone with an IQ under 90 anything beyond a basic trade and life skills, like cooking and checkbook management.</p>

			<p>This is why Caucasians need to organize and march for our civil and human rights.  Our enemies including both the Bolshevik genocidal Democrats and the fat cat Bushevik Republicans do not stand up for our civil rights.  Politicians and preachers need to be organizing marches at schools such as this to demand civility and civil rights against the brutal and murderous foreign mobs who do not belong in this country.  The illegal Mexicans are actually killing more Americans each year than American soldiers killed thus far (over 4000) in Iraq.</p>

			<p>Ditto my last post. The parents need to sue this school for everything they can get, and demand the firing of the principal but not the teacher. A teacher should be allowed to create reasonable assignments without fear of being censored and monitored over political issues.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s much worse than that. &#8220;Our&#8221; own people will use newly enacted &#8220;hate laws&#8221; to arrest us and prosecute us under these Orwellian thought crimes. We&rsquo;ll lose our jobs and be ostracized from the community effectively destroying our income, livelihood, and ability to ever make a difference.  We will be marginalized and vilified in &#8220;our&#8221; press and we will become ruined men and women NEVER able to throw off the yoke of being a &#8220;racist,&#8221; all courtesy of &#8220;our&#8221; media and &#8220;our&#8221; lawmakers! </p>

<p>I disagree.  If you mean that children of illegal invaders should not be considered citizens, I agree.  Of course they shouldn&rsquo;t!  Children of Americans, however, deserve to be recognized by birthright. </p>
<p>We need to stop the Mexican invasion, as well as shut the floodgates to third-world immigration.  We also need to bear in mind what muslims have done to every society they have taken control of.  </p>
<p>Black, mexican, and muslim are all implacable enemies of our people and way of life. We must dI&rsquo;lefend ourselves and every bit of our land. </p>
<p>We should not, however, be unjust or even unkind to any law-abiding person of any color in our country.  Neither should white people be denied the right to protect themselves and their kin, by any means necessary, anywhere, anytime; for to do so is also unjust, and cruel in the extreme. </p>
<p>As for these beasts who attacked the 13-year old girl at school: they want death, let them have it.  Hang &#8216;em high!  </p>

			<p>Now the police showed check the status of every kid and their families that threated the white kid. If they are illigal deport them. If they are illigal give the girl a medal and an &#8220;A&#8221; for the class and for being a great American citizen.</p>

			<p>  So opposing illegal immigration is a hate crime, or at least a crime to some newcomers in our communities. I guess Politically Correct speech trumps free speech. Get ready for more of the same with any of the presidential contenders.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We really need a homeland of our own in North America.&#8221;</p>
<p>We already do.  They are called &#8220;The United States&#8221; and &#8220;Canada&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall having invited any Arabs, blacks or Mestizos here.</p>

			<p>Looks like even Whitey is getting into the hoax crime business.  Of course, this student is going to be prosecuted for her hoax.  Favored groups rarely, if ever, are.</p>

			<p>Guess this was a hoax created by the 13 year old. She inflicted her own wounds and the cameras caught it. She made up the whole thing. Watch the anti&rsquo;s make a big deal about this hoax crime, yet when blacks do it all the time, well, that&rsquo;s a different story. Wonder why she did this? It only makes it harder for Whites now. </p>
