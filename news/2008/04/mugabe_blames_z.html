<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>President Robert Mugabe devoted his first major speech since the unresolved election three weeks ago to denouncing whites and former colonial ruler Britain, an attempt to convince Zimbabweans their political and economic troubles stem from abroad.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are black people who are putting prices up, but they are being used by the whites,&rdquo; Mugabe said, promising to tighten laws that set prices and to crack down on &mdash; and possibly take over &mdash; businesses that break the rules.</p>
<p>Whites &ldquo;want the people to starve so they think the government is wrong and they should remove it,&rdquo; said Mugabe, who has ruled since independence in 1980 but who, according to independent monitors, failed to win re-election in the March 29 presidential vote.</p>
<p>The opposition and independent economists blame Mugabe&rsquo;s economic policies for the collapse of what was once southern Africa&rsquo;s breadbasket. Often violent seizures of white-owned commercial farms that began on Mugabe&rsquo;s orders in 2000 put land in the hands of his cronies instead of productive farmers, black or white, and agricultural production slumped.</p>
<p>The farm invasions were a dramatic example of Mugabe&rsquo;s familiar tactic of demonizing whites. His anti-white rhetoric has long struck a chord in a country that suffered under white minority rule until 1980, and where whites controlled much of the economy even decades later.</p>
<p>But after repeated attacks on the white community, the seizure of most white-owned farms and a dwindling of the white community&rsquo;s size and power, the effectiveness of scapegoating whites may have dwindled.</p>
<p>Mugabe claimed Friday that his political opposition wants &ldquo;this country to go back to white people, to the British, the country we died for. It will never happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 84-year-old president spoke calmly for more than hour, with no visible signs of tiring. He spoke mostly in the Shona language instead of English &mdash; unusual for an event attended by diplomats and other foreign dignitaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware. Be vigilant in the face of the vicious machinations of Britain and its other allies,&rdquo; Mugabe said. &ldquo;Yesterday they ruled by brute force. Today they have perfected their tactics to be more subtle. They are literally buying people to turn against the government. We are being bought like sheep because they have money and because we are suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The few passages in English included thanks to leaders of other southern African countries &ldquo;for clearly articulating our case&rdquo; about the election. The leaders held an emergency summit on Zimbabwe last weekend and issued a weak declaration that failed to criticize Mugabe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank South Africa in a special way for the role it has played in brokering our dialogue,&rdquo; Mugabe added in English.</p>
<p>South African President Thabo Mbeki has argued against the international community taking a hard line against Mugabe, saying he is unlikely to respond to a confrontational approach.</p>
<p>But the failure of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s electoral board to release results of the presidential ballot has angered many people, including in South Africa. On Friday, South African port workers and truckers refused to move a load of weapons destined for Zimbabwe&rsquo;s security forces.</p>
<p>Independent tallies suggest opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai got the most votes &mdash; but not enough to win outright and avoid a runoff with Mugabe after a campaign in which the economy was the main issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mugabe accused others of plotting violence. While he named no one, his comments could signal a further government crackdown. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We know some people are planning that there will be places where there will be violence, with people burning shops and cars,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Those who are planning this, please stop it immediately, otherwise you are going to be in serious trouble with us.&rdquo; </p>

			<p>What a joke, there are a heck of a lot more Blacks currently living in the UK, than there are Whites living in Zimbabwe. But then, British whites aren&rsquo;t ethnically cleansing them from the land, the way Blacks are cleansing whites from the land. Of course, fools that they are, they are also cleasning themselves of food, and everything else that kept the country going. HYPOCRITIES!!!</p>

			<p>Good going, Mugabe.  Probably 99% of blacks in Zimbabwe not in your orbit want white rule back (imagine that, daily food AND working electricity).  &#8220;Oh please, oh please, Br&rsquo;er Fox, don&rsquo;t throw me into the brier patch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody wants anybody to starve, but that seems to be a constant phenomenom in black culture.  When whites help them, they live better off.  When whites move out, the country goes to hell in a handbasket.</p>

<p>Other than separation of the races and the races being left to their own devices how did the blacks suffer?  They never suffered anywhere near the gravity of what Rhodesia&rsquo;s whites of today suffer.  The first thing these Marxists need to do is get the facts straight!<br>

<p>It will never happen for the simple reason that no white person could be persuaded to move to Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>At first I thought this was a liberal reporter taking a shot at the evil West. But maybe it&rsquo;s true from the perspective of the native Zimbabweans with an IQ of 70 and their black grudge against whites. A ruined nation and starvation is seen as a small price to pay in order to become free of white people.<br>

			<p>Whether it&rsquo;s an entire nation in Africa that was once a civilized paradise or a neighborhood in Atlanta, blacks destroy whatever they touch.  They cannot be self sufficient, or maintain any large institution.  They just do not have the intelligence or ability to do so.  </p>

			<p>Blacks actually have this belief that Whites are bent on destroying and exterminating them. I remember watching television with a highly educated well-mannered black woman from West Africa who was my friend. They were showing this flood in Africa on TV. She said,&#8221; Don&rsquo;t White people find a lot of pleasure in seeing such dark people in pain?&#8221; I reminded her about the floods in southern India and how British people (as separate from the British Government) collected a large sum of money as charity for the unfortunate victims of that land. Her logic was, &#8220;The British did that because the richest guy in Britain (Steel King Mittal) is Indian.&#8221; That is the most ridiculous logic I have heard in my life, that too coming from such an educated person but that&rsquo;s African &#8216;logic&rsquo; for you. After all the aid White people give, the hatred is just unbelievable. Yet I know loads of Whites both Christian/non Christian who give money to African causes and go to Africa to run clinics, build schools for poor Africans and adopt African kids. The rich blacks there do nothing about the poor in their own nation. </p>

			<p>I just knew that Zimbabwe&rsquo;s problems were caused by YT and not by a failed leader who probably can&rsquo;t balance a checking account. Whether it&rsquo;s Detroit, Washing, DC. or Zimbabwe, black rule has been a total failure and looking at another future election and the brain-dead, blind following of Barak Obama, I ask, can anyone say $100,000,000 loaf of bread?????</p>

A  joke  going  around  currently  in the  South  Africa/ Zambia/Zimbabwe  area.</p>
<p> A Zimbabwean (black) man is in his house with his wife and two kids at night in a town in Zimbabwe. there is no electricity, no running  water, the night is hot, mosquitoes everywhere, they are hungry, there is no food, they are suffering. Suddenly, the kitchen tap starts running with water and the electricity comes on. The man says to his wife, &#8220;quick bring me my cutlass, the whites have taken over the country again. We must fight!&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mugabe is half right when he blames Britain. Rhodesia was known as the breadbasket of Africa prior to 1980. The blacks &#8220;suffered&#8221; from a high standard of living, a strong currency, good employment prospects and full bellies in a nation that actually exported food to other countries. There was a constant stream of Rhodesian cattle carcasses being shipped through South Africa en route to Europe - some of the finest beef in the world.</p>
<p>This was an unbearable situation for the loony-left Labour government in Britain, however. Britain was instrumental in forcing a white capitulation in Rhodesia and then reneged on its promises of cash to reimburse white farmers for their farms. Rhodesia&rsquo;s unilateral declaration of independence from Britain clearly still rankled in Whitehall.</p>
<p>At first, Mugabe was the Left in the UK&rsquo;s darling, and was considered a model of African democracy. However, Britains chickens have come home to roost. Predictably, the Marxist terrorist Mugabe turned into your common African despot, and Britain turned on him.</p>
<p>I find it extremely hard to sympathize with the UK when Mugabe rants and raves against them. Their very own loony, anti-white left-wing zeal was and is the root cause of the problems in Zimbabwe. Some of the worst anti-whites are other, left-wing whites.</p>

<p>Uh oh&hellip;now the citizens of Zimbabwe are REALLY in trouble! If South Africa played a special role in brokering ANYTHING, it was how to kill off the few remaining Zim patriots capable of fighting, and keeping Mugabe in power. Maybe THAT&rsquo;s who paid for the intercepted shipment of 3 million rounds of AK ammo, 1500 RPG-7&rsquo;s and rockets, and other assorted munitions that were stopped at the South African port of Durban five fays ago.

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that we have our own loony left in the US  &mdash;  you know, the ones who live in 90+% White communities behind iron gates with 24-hour armed guards   &mdash;  just like Obama&rsquo;s mentor, Reverend Wright.   The leftists in the US were absolutely complicit in putting that racist thug Mugabe on his throne.</p>
<p>What frosts me about the British (and the US) AND the MSM is that once the violence against Whites began in Zim and SA, they (Whites) were completely forgotten and abandoned  &mdash;  and are still forgotten and at the mercy of black violence and ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>From the article Stephanie posted about two weeks ago:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;.As President Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s emissary to Africa, [Andrew) Young played a pivotal role  &mdash;  along with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, and other Carter administration officials  &mdash;  in enthroning Mugabe&rsquo;s terror regime and turning much of the Dark Continent into the nightmarish slaughterhouse of chaos and terror it has become&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Official figures vary, but it can be roughly estimated that around 30,000 Matabele were slaughtered in Mugabe&rsquo;s &lsquo;liberation&rsquo; of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe&hellip; Mugabe&hellip; would go on to slaughter Zimbabwe&rsquo;s white farmers, take away their land, and plunge the nation into a hell hole of debt, hunger, hyperinflation, murder, HIV/Aids, and hopelessness&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;I&rsquo;m not sure most whites (in America, that is) even know WHERE Zimbabwe IS, and probably, they don&rsquo;t care&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by at 2:12 AM on April 19 </p>
<p>I would agree that most Americans couldn&rsquo;t fine Zim on a map.  As to the not caring part  &mdash;  the controlled press prints very few, if  any stories detailing the farm killings in SA (or Zim) or the daily black-on-White violence taking place in those black-run hell holes.</p>
<p>Yet, the MSM runs DAILY, front page stories, above the fold, about war orphans (send money, lots of it), black refugees (open up YOUR communities), black-created Civil War (send medicine and money), starving populations (send money and food), black destroyed schools (send your people and money to re-build them) and AIDS &#8216;victims&rsquo; (send billions, and get Bono to plead your cause).</p>
<p>What about the Whites who are being KILLED and ethnically cleansed by blacks in Africa?  Who speaks for them?  If it wasn&rsquo;t for the Internet, none of this would come to light and many of us on this site have written that we are learning about the violence and mayhem directed at African Whites for the first time.</p>
<p>Here is a typical MSM report:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Even the farm invasions were lionized by the late Peter Jennings of ABC News, who in a nationally televised report made the ZANU-PF terrorists who were murdering, torturing, and raping the ethno-European farmers out to be &#8216;war veterans&rsquo; and heroes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://thenewamerican.com/node/5059" rel="nofollow">https://thenewamerican.com/node/5059</a></p>
<p>This is what the MSM never reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;To date at least 2,951 farmers have been murdered since 1994 in armed militia-attacks on commercial farms and smallholdings in South Africa, Crime Busters of South Africa&rsquo;s records indicate&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;In the past 10 years, white poverty has grown by 150 percent,&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://southafricanhell.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">https://southafricanhell.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>If not for the Internet, precious little information would be known about the condition of Whites in SA and Zim.  As it is, the site posted above has been shut down once, has moved,  and is in danger of being shut down again.</p>
<p>This is what Whites in SA and Zim are up against.  Whites in the US  have their own battles with the MSM but that is another story.</p>

<p><a href="https://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/needtoknow/2008/04/fed_up_with_mugabe.html" rel="nofollow">https://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/needtoknow/2008/04/fed_up_with_mugabe.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Zimbabwe was the &#8220;bread basket of Africa.&#8221; It produced enough wheat and other food to feed most of the Southern part of Africa. Than this dictator came to power and chased off all the European farmers that also had lived there for many generations and who, admittedly, had build a nice business that employed many people and paid them decent wages. Nobody that worked on the farms complained that they were being exploited. One day a bunch of hooligans showed up and chased the rightful owners off their property. You know what they did with the many acres of wheat that were ready for harvest? THEY BURNED IT AND EVERYBODY WENT HUNGRY. Yes, those people sure were ready to take over.

<p><a href="https://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/needtoknow/2008/04/fed_up_with_mugabe.html" rel="nofollow">https://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/needtoknow/2008/04/fed_up_with_mugabe.html</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Zimbabwe was the &ldquo;bread basket of Africa.&rdquo; It produced enough wheat and other food to feed most of the Southern part of Africa. Than this dictator came to power and chased off all the European farmers that also had lived there for many generations and who, admittedly, had build a nice business that employed many people and paid them decent wages. Nobody that worked on the farms complained that they were being exploited. One day a bunch of hooligans showed up and chased the rightful owners off their property. You know what they did with the many acres of wheat that were ready for harvest? THEY BURNED IT AND EVERYBODY WENT HUNGRY. Yes, those people sure were ready to take over. Now they are all hungry and ready to beg for food from the rest of us. Had they left well enough alone, they would all be at least fed and most of the WILLING would be middle class or better. I&rsquo;m trying to keep my cool but it&rsquo;s time to tell it like it is: Name me ONE African Country that has not gone to the dogs since they gained independence. With the exception of South Africa there are none or at least very few. And the story of South Africa is not completed yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>*All this is very true, but reality never seems to enter into the equation with most of them. There are Black Africans living in Europe, living a far better quality of life than they ever did in Africa, with access to the internet, who will still post how proud they are of their African brothers who are chasing off the white man who has no business in Zimbabwe, (a Black African country). They overlook the irony, that by that same logic, they should have no place in any European country. But irony also eludes them. They do not wish to confront reality and admit that Africas breadbasket is a wasteland since black rule. Instead, they would rather spout false propaganda, about how all blacks were kings and queens living in splendor, and sailing the world, until evil white colonizers enslaved them, stole their knowledge, and forced them to live in so primitive a manner. How do you reason with people who would reject reality, in favor of fairytales and myths?*<br>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the pattern of blacks throughout the world?  They arrive in a country, state or community then they start their endless streams of complaining about how they are oppressed or dominated.  Then, after their children have reduced their areas to crime-ridden dumps, whites leave and the blacks get elected to office.</p>
<p>Then, they siphon off any profits from the productive, pad their individual wallets, and then move on to the next country, state or community.</p>
<p>I believe blacks know they can&rsquo;t produce a peaceful community, they know they can&rsquo;t produce any kind of industrial output on a consistent and long-term scale.  Mostly, they know they are self-destructive, but they need scapegoats to displace blame and responsibility.</p>
<p>But toxic-tribalism trumps common sense and they consistently put themselves under the lash of some petty tyrant here or abroad.  </p>

			<p>Rhodesia is kind of like the Southwest US, except the US saga hasn&rsquo;t played out yet.  When it does, telling the stories of the two scenarios, generally, will be about the same.  In fact if termed in generalities, in the foreseeable future, one story could almost be told of both areas and stay within the limits of credibility.</p>
<p>In the US Southwest, whites designed and built the infrastructure, creating a beautiful civilization out of what amounted to desert and cactus, at least for the most part.  South Africans did the same in Rhodesia, but in a different kind of terrain.  However, they both were very sparsely populated areas until the whites arrived.</p>
<p>Blacks filtered into Rhodesia looking for free handouts and work from whites.  Mexicans did the same in the US Southwest.</p>
<p>Blacks in Rhodesia became so numerous they embarked on a campaign to claim the civilization as their own, and they invented stories about how the land was taken from their ancestors, forgetting of course to mention that their ancestors lived far outside the original settlement areas in villages with straw huts. Being black and incompetent, too incompetent to compete in a free society, a huge portion of them turned to communism, eventually forming guerilla units that murdered, stole, maimed and killed, so intense was their greed in wanting to take over such a beautiful, prosperous land. </p>
<p>Mexicans in the Southwest became so numerous the more militant ones incited the others to claim the land as theirs, although none ever had ancestors living in the area and the land itself, without the high tech ornaments, was as valueless as identical terrain south of the border in Mexico, which presently lies vacant and unused.   Mexican control of the area came about by chasing off the indigenous indians living there.  Those that didn&rsquo;t leave were killed.  But the Mexicans never, ever mention how they acquired the area.</p>
<p>But unlike the blacks in Rhodesia they haven&rsquo;t yet formed terrorist units to create open warfare in insurgency type attacks, pressing to take over the area via force.  They&rsquo;re still working on that, but the militant voices are rising and the naive, out-of-touch white elitists are so arrogant they believe the subversive elements will sing the Star Bangled Banner and salute the flag if they are catered to enough, and the problem will be solved, so it will be a few more years before our Southwestern militants take up arms.  Many of them believe it will be unnecessary, because, like Rhodesia, all they have to do is inundate the area with warm bodies and they will succeed in taking over by sheer weight of numbers.  They brazenly tell you if you ask, &#8220;Mexico is where Mexicans are.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you bring the parallels to these two societies to the attention of the white political elitists, they don&rsquo;t seem to care, having long ago abandoned their people, their traditions, and way of life, in favor of money and greed.</p>
<p>How many other lands have been taken this way throughout history?  The answer, of course, is many.  But there&rsquo;s never been the level of sophistication in years past comparable to the civiliizations of today, so third world peoples taking over modern infrastructure isn&rsquo;t the same as in simpler times.</p>
<p>But more importantly blacks and Mexicans have taken over&hellip;.or in the case of the US Southwest attempting to take over&hellip;.areas that have been built and maintained by a population with not only numerous highly intelligent achievers, but one that has the special abilities to progress and succeed in the era of high technology. </p>
<p>Black Rhodesians, in the process of starvation and ruin, are showing us what the result of such a takeover has yielded them.  It will take a while longer, but we will also see the Mexicans in the Southwest US eventually gravitate to the same level in the land south of the Rio Grande, where tar paper shacks and raw sewage in the streets are the norm.</p>
<p>And like their countrymen in Mexico, and the black Rhodesians, they will be starving also.</p>

			<p>The only possible salvation for the African continent would be recolonization.  The black population has proven in every instance in which it has taken political control that they simply cannot rise above tribalism and the hopeless corruption and mismanagement that it breeds.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be too terribly surprised to see parts of Africa once again under colonial rule in the foreseeable future, but it won&rsquo;t be white rule.  Should it happen it will be colonization by China and other Northeast Asian powers.  Africa has many resources Asians need.  The problem for the native Africans is that they&rsquo;re not among those resources.  Seen through slanted eyes they&rsquo;re simply weeds in a garden and will be dealt with accordingly</p>

			<p>The land reform program in Zimbabwe needed to happen;  however, the implementation and management of the program has put the whole country&rsquo;s agriculture production in decline.  The reason is because there was no plan to provide the new farmers with equipment and fertilizer to maintain production.  <br>
The problem in Zimbabwe has its root in the Lancaster Agreement signed by Britain, the former colonizer of Zimbabwe.  In this agreement Britain promised to pay white farmers to vacate the land but Britain failed to keep its promise.  Consequently, Mugabe took back the land and gave it back to its original owners.  <br>
I&rsquo;m black American and I feel that it was morally wrong for 1% of the white populataion in Zimbabwe to own 90% of the arable land.  This was greed and this is what caused the problem in Zimbabwe.  I think had the white farmers learned to share the land, Mugabe would not have had the &#8220;war veterans&#8221; start squating on the land and thus forcing Mugabe to start the fast track land reclamation program.  As a result, everyone in Zimbabwe loses; the white have lost their productive farms and the blacks have lost some of the most skilled professsionals responsible for the development of the country. In addition, the sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the West have caused serious problems on the economy because the country can not get development loans from the IMF and the Internation World Bank.<br>
It&rsquo;s really sad that such a promising African country is now facing a very challenging future. We must learn to live together, whatever your color is.  We are all children of God.</p>

<p>Whites settled the land, which was VERY sparsely populated.  They took land from nobody, as in NADA.  To say blacks couldn&rsquo;t succeed because of a lack of fertilizer or equipment is nonsense, but, if it were true, what you&rsquo;re really saying is that blacks confiscated white land without having any kind of plan on what they were to do with it.  What you&rsquo;re doing by pointing that out is verifying black lack of intelligence.</p>
<p>Too, you forgot to mention that white equipment was stolen by these black thugs, along with the land, so they had white equipment in addition to white land. So far as obtaining fertilizer is concerned, are these black farmers so inept and stupid they sit waiting for a government agent to arrive with fertilizer and a list of instructions on how to grow crops, and a check from Briton every month to give them welfare while they continue to fail to produce, and the ground turns to dust?  In your attempt to cast doubt on black inability, greed and guilt, in this matter you have pointed out their short comings far better than anything I can write about.</p>
<p>Their failure, my friend, was the result of black inability&hellip;and greed&hellip;just as it is the world over, including other parts of Africa.  Black failure is not confined to Rhodesia. Blacks can&rsquo;t succeed anywhere, which they have proven themselves, so trying to make excuses for their failure in Rhodesia just doesn&rsquo;t wash. Rhodesia is just more of the same.  It has nothing to do with a lack of equipment, fertilizer, or what have you and everything to do with the usual black standard operating procedures.</p>
<p>The argument you have tried to make reminds me of the many talking black heads on television, foolishly trying to convince someone that Jeremiah Wright had legitimate complaints for his hatred; that O.J. Simpson is innocent and unequivocal DNA evidence alone did not prove his guilt, and EVERY SINGLE black atrocity committed by blacks, usually against whites, wasn&rsquo;t unfavorable to blacks, but had other reasons than what are&hellip;and were&hellip; obviously known to be true by most whites who are not mentally unstable leftists.  There is always some absolutely stupid rhetoric put out by blacks constantly, inanely expecting people to believe the nonsense they endlessly spew.<br>
 <br>
Kidd:  &#8220;Consequently, Mugabe took back the land and gave it back to its original owners.&#8221; </p>
<p>Mugabe couldn&rsquo;t &#8220;take back&#8221; what he didn&rsquo;t own.  The original owners were whites.  He illegally confiscated private property much of which went to bureaucrats in the Mugabe regime who also were too dimwitted to prosper, and the land went to ruin.  </p>
<p>Kidd: &#8220;I&rsquo;m black American and I feel that it was morally wrong for 1% of the white populataion in Zimbabwe to own 90% of the arable land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why?  They settled the land; they invested in it; they gave their blood, sweat, intelligence, knowledge, and toil to make something of it, and they created employment for hundreds of thousands of blacks who didn&rsquo;t have the intelligence to create the same kind of farms.  Your complaint is a common black complaint everywhere.  If blacks can&rsquo;t achieve on their own they expect to have whites share their hard work and dedication with them, and to save black face from admitting their inadequacies they whine that whites somehow didn&rsquo;t get all they have fairly and squarely and should redistribute what they have legitimately earned among blacks.  It&rsquo;s absolutely disgusting. </p>
<p>Kidd: &#8220;This was greed and this is what caused the problem in Zimbabwe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, it was definitely greed.  Black greed.  They came for work, then when they inundated the area so heavily they cast their greedy eyes on taking it all, not just the wages for employment.  After they got it they now won&rsquo;t even agree that they killed the goose that laid their golden eggs. The same would be true here in the US.  They want it all, but even if they got it it would be Zimbabwe West in no time at all, and there would be blacks talking non-stop blaming everything and everybody but themselves, just as they do now.   Undeceive yourself, my friend, blacks haven&rsquo;t succeeded anywhere on earth.  If you can understand that, how can you believe the stupid Afrocentric lies that make an excuse for ALL their failures, blaming it on white oppression or racism?  </p>
<p>The biggest mistake blacks make is to continue to deny the truth in the face of overwhelming evidence, instead of accepting facts as they are and working to make themselves better.  They do not because of GREED and arrogance.  They want what the white man has without earning it, stupidly thinking that it all will run by itself and all they have to do is sit in the seat, as they think whitey has done, and it&rsquo;s smooth sailing from takeover time until the end of time.  That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re starving in Rhodesia right now.</p>
<p>Kidd: &#8220;I think had the white farmers learned to share the land, Mugabe would not have had the &ldquo;war veterans&rdquo; start squatting&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Those were not &#8220;war veterans.&#8221;  Those who participated in the criminal terrorism prior to takeover would be well up in years and the so called &#8220;squatters&#8221; were young greedy, evil blacks who were as jackals at the lion&rsquo;s kill ready to leap the first chance their greedy eyes detected an opening or a weakness.</p>
<p>Because the white elitists in the West are without any kind of backbone, the truth will never be told and the West will continue to listen to the excuses for failure made by black leaders, and food aid, medicine and the like will continue to pour into Africa and black enclaves in the West in order to take care of them, because they&rsquo;re as helpless children, all the while listening to rhetoric that sounds as if it is from an 11 year old child claiming to be superior to everybody else, but haven&rsquo;t been recognized as such because of some kind of bias against them.  My advice to them would be to grow up, but then I remember that they can&rsquo;t.  It&rsquo;s not within their power.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right, but for the wrong reason: Greed is indeed the reason for the mess in Rhodesia (I just decided never to call it &#8220;Zimbabwe&#8221; again, since that&rsquo;s the name of a failed nation-state). Greed by the Soviet and Cuban masters of the South West African People&rsquo;s Organization (SWAPO) to steal the land&rsquo;s natural resources via the expedient of a racial/communist takeover. The Soviet Union and the Cubans led the black population of Rhodesia to believe in the glorious brainwashing of revolution, in order to get a foothold on the continent. The indigenous population, with an average IQ in the 70-85 range, fell for it. And now the average Rhodesian, White or black, is paying the price for their predecessors&rsquo; greed.</p>
<p>And as for your claim that is was &#8220;morally wrong&#8221; for Whites to own 90% of the arable land (if indeed that figure is correct), ask the average Rhodesian today if he would rather have moral purity or a full stomach.</p>

<p>Land reform needed to happen?  I guess you mean that if whites weren&rsquo;t so greedy and had so much, then blacks would be doing all right about now?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the excuse this time?</p>
<p>Zimbabwe has gone the way of Haiti, since the blacks murdered all the whites.  That&rsquo;s what they want to do in South Africa and Zimbabwe, and they would if they thought they could get away with it.</p>
<p>In Haiti they called murder, &#8220;rising up against oppression.&#8221;  In Zimbabwe, stealing land from whites who have owned it legitimately for a couple hundred years is called &#8220;land redistribution.&#8221;  It won&rsquo;t be until blacks begin a wholesale slaughter of whites that they&rsquo;ll lyingly refer to it as they did in Haiti, attempting to excuse their blood thirsty murdering.</p>
<p>Blacks can&rsquo;t live unless they&rsquo;re cared for by whites.  Here&rsquo;s a current picture of Haiti.</p>

<p>&#8220;HUNGER smashed in the front gate of Haiti&rsquo;s presidential palace. Hunger poured on to the streets, burning tyres and taking on soldiers and the police. Hunger sent the country&rsquo;s prime minister packing.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even more countries in Africa that are falling apart and starving.  Could you tell us how it is the fault of whites, so we will be able to properly hate ourselves?<br>

<p>Well, you&rsquo;re right about it being greed, but it was on the part of Mugabe. And what good has that arable land done any of them since the uprising? They know nothing about farming, hence after cutting down the wheat, and harvesting the crops the white farmers cultivated and grew, the crops have withered away. They are so desperate for food, they can&rsquo;t wait to get their hands on any surviving farms white farmers still remain on. And it&rsquo;s interesting Mugabe is stooping to these tactics again, since not all that long ago, he was trying to talk white into returning, claiming they would come to no harm, it didn&rsquo;t work of course, so he is back to threatening the few remaing white farmers into handing over the land. Those farms will only provide a temporary food supply. Soon as they strip it, nothing will grow back just like before. After every last white farmer is gone, they should be allowed to wallow in their own misery and hunger. Whites owe them nothing! <br>

			<p>Mugabe has long taken a leaf from the ranting book of Hitler where he blamed the German (and European) Jews for Germany&rsquo;s problems. And as with Hitler, it is all lies.  The problem he has now is that if he is not elected again he will lose his diplomatic immunity and risks being arrested (if there is any justice in the world) for genocide and crimes against humanity.  </p>
<p>It is vital that he is arrested and tried in The Hague unlike other African monsters such as Idi Amin who escaped punishment on earth.   An example has to be made to show other such despots around the world that they will pay for their murdering way of life and not live out theri old ages in luxury in another country as Amin did in Saudi Arabia when he became a Muslim.   All Mugabe&rsquo;s guilty cronies also have to be charged even if it is by the incoming new government, but having lived in South Africa for 25 years we must understand the African mentality.  If they commit a crime, often they think that by apologising profusely, they will be excused.</p>
<p>Letters and petitions need to be written to your leaders and the United Nations Secretary General.  They could be organised by the Press including AMREN.</p>

			<p>I would like to respond to all the comments to this article.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe is royally messed up because of its history.  That includes British colonialism, Rhodesia, and the kleptocracy of Robert Mugabe and the ZANU-PF.</p>
<p>What I find rather disturbing is that all of you keep incessantly blaming these peoples problems on the fact that they are Black.</p>
<p>I know the litany of &#8220;all of Africa&rsquo;s problems were caused by whites/European colonialism&#8221; is rather mind numbing.</p>
<p>However if you look right next door to Zimbabwe and SA you will find a little talked about country called Botswana.</p>
<p>Botswana has a government who&rsquo;s initial founding seemed hopelessly backward by Western standards (tribal councils, etc.) and they had very little experience with colonialism.  Only 6 miles of paved road in the entire country at 1966 independence.</p>
<p>Despite this Botswana today has a per capita GDP higher than Malaysia, a ZERO tolerance for corruption and political extremism, a rapidly developing infrastructure, and a tax system that is being used to build hospitals, teach children, and treat disease epidemics, all without the help of Western aid.</p>
<p>The racism in Zimbabwe is only being used as an excuse.  Had Rhodesia not been so blatantly discriminatory then the ZANU-PF could have never came to power and would not be able to blame it&rsquo;s problems on its own or on past racism.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe is a clear example that diversity is bad, Botswana is a clear example that homogeneity is good  IRRESPECTIVE of the race of those involved.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Kidd: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m black American and I feel that it was morally wrong for 1% of the white populataion in Zimbabwe to own 90% of the arable land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which perfectly mirrors the incessant whine by almost ALL American Blacks. That what &#8220;racist&#8221; Whites worked, invested their money and intelligence on over generations, should be &#8220;shared&#8221; with our dysfunctional Blacks. But this argument wholly ignores the reality OUR perpetually impoverished Blacks are trapped in poverty by their own lack of intelligence, work ethic and drive. Look at those many Blacks who did avail themselves of at least a public school education. Who actually learned, graduated and then got decent paying jobs. Those &#8220;successful&#8221; Blacks manage to refute that silly whine by their own successes. As it mocks that incessant claim that White racism is keeping Blacks mired in life-long poverty.</p>
<p>I agree with the poster who answered Kidd&rsquo;s sophomoric post with&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why? They settled the land; they invested in it; they gave their blood, sweat, intelligence, knowledge, and toil to make something of it, and they created employment for hundreds of thousands of blacks who didn&rsquo;t have the intelligence to create the same kind of farms.</p>
<p>It speaks eloquently for the typical Black African mentality. OVERBREEDING, not greed, is what keeps Black Africa from ever becoming functional nations. Their innate stupidity in controlling population size to match available resources. The laziness and ineptness that kept the modern Rhodesian Blacks from actually feeding themselves with the stolen lands.</p>
<p>Five thousands years in the future, African Blacks will still be mired in their incompetence, inability to function like White human beings. Blaming their failures on Whites, selfishly depriving Black Africans of sufficient help, etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>But the Kidd and his type will never be able to bring themselves to admit this truth. Whether about American impoverished Blacks or their native African counterparts.</p>
<p>Kidd also overlooks the reality that when White Europeans moved into Dark Africa and farmed and civilized the land, the areas were at best sparsely populated with small local tribes. That the massive overpopulation in Africa occurred over the last sixty or seventy years and is hardly the fault of Whites.<br>

The people posting here are the educated and middle class..and that sign alone tells you this movement has a massive following.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Just Completely Destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like Camden, Newark and Detroit, right?</p>
<p>I think some of the black posters here are being a bit dishonest.  The land is really just an excuse.  If it was land these &#8220;war veterans&#8221; wanted, they would stay on these farms and continue working them after occupying them.  They&rsquo;re not doing that, though.  They loot whatever is there, destroy non-portable property, and then move on.  They resemble a Biblical plague of locusts far more than people who want their own small family plots on which to scratch out a living.</p>

			<p>&#8221;..That the massive overpopulation in Africa occurred over the last sixty or seventy years and is hardly the fault of Whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Posted by Fed Up at 5:36 PM on April 21 </p>
<p>I hate to quibble with you Fed Up, but in a sense the massive overpopulation of Africa IS partly the fault of Whites  &mdash;  as in White medicine, White-created AIDS treatments, White food programs, White-instigated clean water, and busy-body Whites and their stupid programs who LOVE spending other people&rsquo;s money on the hopelessness of Africa (Bono and Bush).  All those things have contributed to a massive expansion of the population..  As you wrote:  &ldquo;&hellip;Their innate stupidity in controlling population size to match available resources&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
I think we should cut off ALL aid to Africa (unless it is to install  IUDs in the female population), offer immediate sanctuary to any remaining Whites, get the H out of Africa and leave her to her own devices (and yes I know the Chinese are moving in  &mdash;  let&rsquo;s see what kind of aid THEY put up, how many refugees and AIDS orphans they&rsquo;ll admit to their country, how much of their new wealth they&rsquo;re willing to &lsquo;share&rsquo; with Africans).</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;&hellip;Has anyone else seen the pictures of this country when it was under white rule and the pictures of the same buildings just 10 to 15 years after the country was handed over to blacks. JUST COMPLETELY DISTROYED&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Posted by Marc at 9:56 PM on April 21 </p>
<p>Marc:  </p>
<p>Yes, I have seen the pictures and they are truly heartbreaking.  Here is a link to a site with before and after pictures of Johannesburg  &mdash;  appropriately titled &lsquo;Death of Johannesburg.&rsquo;</p>
<p>See it and weep.</p>

			<p>RANGER:  I liked your comparison of what happened in Rhodesia to what is currently happening in the American Southwest.  However I must disagree with you as to the matter of &#8220;they haven&rsquo;t formed terrorist units yet.&#8221;   The hispanic gangs that are creating criminal chaos in every major and many mid size cities in America are well organized and very well armed. </p>
<p>Hispanic gang membership in the US numbers in the hundreds of thousands.  They come from cultures and countries where the line between narco-gangsters and narco-terrorist and marxist guerrillas is non-existent.  They are actively involved in ethnic cleansing in every neighborhood where they have become the majority.   Americans are just too tranquilized by their rapidly fading &#8220;good life&#8221; to wake up see the truth.</p>

			<p>Botswana is a success story because it turned its back on Socialism and went the Capitalist route, not that Capitalism is the perfect political system either, but operated properly and fairly, it does tend to generate prosperity and social stability much better than Marxism ever can.  </p>
<p>Another political identity that doesn&rsquo;t seem to figure predominately, is religion most especially, Islam. </p>
<p>I believe that&rsquo;s where its success lies.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;Zimbabwe is a clear example that diversity is bad, Botswana is a clear example that homogeneity is good IRRESPECTIVE of the race of those involved.&#8221;</i><br>

+++++++++++++++ </p>
<p>Botswana steered clear of neo-Marxism and went the Capitalist route.  Also, religion, especially Islam, is not being allowed to influence the political and judicial systems overly so.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s demographic composition is of many tribes, albeit of the same race along with different tongues which is commonplace in all of Africa, but in the future, could possibly also destroy Botswana as infighting for supremacy accelerates year on year unless the political regime of the day can continue to keep the lid on such a potentially destructive powderkeg.</p>
<p>There is also a fairly small population of Europeans and Asians insitu who control the running and management of the commercial sector including the flow of the country&rsquo;s finances.  These non-African peoples also considerably influence the handling of the country&rsquo;s wealth as well.</p>
<p>These are the obvious reasons for Botswana&rsquo;s present success. <br>

			<p>However if you look right next door to Zimbabwe and SA you will find a little talked about country called Botswana.</p>
<p>Botswana has a government who&rsquo;s initial founding seemed hopelessly backward by Western standards (tribal councils, etc.) and they had very little experience with colonialism. Only 6 miles of paved road in the entire country at 1966 independence.</p>
<p>Despite this Botswana today has a per capita GDP higher than Malaysia, a ZERO tolerance for corruption and political extremism, a rapidly developing infrastructure, and a tax system that is being used to build hospitals, teach children, and treat disease epidemics, all without the help of Western aid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for the information about Botswana.  I have often asked myself if there are any countries in Africa that aren&rsquo;t disasters, but never did the research.  It&rsquo;s good that Botswana is not just another African &#8220;hellhole&#8221;. But, I do know that Botswana does have a huge incidence of HIV/AIDS infection.  Know of any European countries that do?</p>
<p>Botswana is among the countries hardest hit by AIDS. In 2005 there were an estimated 270,000 people living with HIV. This, in a country with a total population below two million, gives Botswana an adult HIV prevalence rate of 24.1%, the second highest in the world after Swaziland. (An earlier UNAIDS estimate of 37.3% prevalence in Botswana is now thought to have been too high.)1 </p>

			<p>&#8220;What I find rather disturbing is that all of you keep incessantly blaming these peoples problems on the fact that they are Black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anybody that finds that disturbing isn&rsquo;t paying attention to the many black failures throughout the world down through the ages.  Blacks have lived a stone-age existence all their lives, including the present. </p>
<p>Of course they fail because they&rsquo;re black.  THey are who they are,my friend, and their problems are because they&rsquo;re black.</p>

<p>6 miles of paved road, an HIV infection rate of 24%, with the rest of the country living in the stone-age, and you&rsquo;re bragging that it&rsquo;s BETTER than the African norm?</p>
<p>Remind me never to vote for you for political office.</p>

			<p>YOu ever notice how nobody ever goes after these black warload thug dictators who starve their people in mass.  Yet we keep dumping more and more money into these countries with no results for our money.  All you ever see is walking skeltons with a skelton kid hanging off their mother&rsquo;s hip.  </p>
<p>It is completely disgusting what&rsquo;s being allowed to happen to these woman.</p>
<p>I notice that the World Court didn&rsquo;t have any problem going after Milsovic for trying to protect his country from an onslaught of muslims.  Unfortunately, they didn&rsquo;t get the verdict or the justice they wanted for Milsovic.  He up and died before they could lynch him before the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that these black warload thug dictators should have been strung up before the world a long time ago, at least for the sake of the masses that have died and are dying right now as I write this.</p>
