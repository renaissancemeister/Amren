						<p>The foreigner is buried in a small-town cemetery, against a barbed-wire fence in an unmarked plot set aside for poor people.</p>
<p>He might be Mexican. He might be Guatemalan. But he&rsquo;s simply called No. 8, a man with no name because his identity is still unknown, a year after he was killed in a car wreck with seven other illegal immigrants in southeastern Utah.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 2,000 illegal immigrants have died in the Southwest since 2002, and many are nameless in death &mdash; buried as anonymous victims of heat stroke, car crashes or other calamities.</p>
<p>They typically carry no ID, just the clothes on their back and the dream of a life better than the one they left behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re filling our morgues,&#8221; said Todd Matthews of Livingston, Tenn., who works for the Doe Network, a volunteer organization that helps law enforcement with unidentified remains.</p>
<p>More than half of the border-crossing deaths in the Southwest since 2002 have occurred in Arizona&rsquo;s Pima County, which includes Tucson, on the Arizona-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Bruce Anderson, a forensic anthropologist in Tucson, said a quarter of the victims there lack names. Many remains are little more than bleached bone after a few days in the sun, making them almost impossible to identify.</p>
<p>&#8220;They die in the middle of nowhere,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;Most Americans die in their car, in their house, or with somebody they know.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unknown when or how he entered the country. But on the night of April 15, 2007, [Nol 8] piled into a sport utility vehicle in Phoenix, joining 13 other people for a trip to St. Louis.</p>
<p>They crossed the Arizona-Utah state line at 3:30 a.m. At some point, the driver drifted out of his lane, overcorrected and lost control of the vehicle, sending it spinning onto its side.</p>
<p>The SUV rolled several times, and seven passengers were thrown from it. Eight people, all illegal immigrants, were killed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The body of No. 8 was transported more than 300 miles north to the Utah medical examiner&rsquo;s office in Salt Lake City, where doctors took fingerprints, photographs and samples from his body. But prospects for identifying him became increasingly bleak.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have a very fresh body, and still the person is unidentifiable because there are no leads as to who they might be,&#8221; said Dr. Todd Grey, the state&rsquo;s chief medical examiner. &#8220;There&rsquo;s certainly not going to be a missing person&rsquo;s report filed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By last fall, No. 8&rsquo;s body had been in Salt Lake City for six months. No family members had stepped up to claim a missing relative fitting his description and circumstances.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when Danny Palmer, funeral director at San Juan Mortuary, was called to pick up the body and return it to southeastern Utah for burial, just a few miles from where the crash occurred.</p>
<p>Palmer stored the body in the mortuary garage for about a week while the grave was prepared. San Juan County paid the $700 bill for the burial, and the mortuary donated a steel casket valued at $1,000.</p>
<p>There was no prayer, no ceremony as the body was laid to rest in plot 55 in the Blanding cemetery. No. 8 was recorded in cemetery records as &#8220;unknown male&#8221; &mdash; an immigrant who died thousands of miles from home and was finally buried Oct. 12.</p>

			<p>Does everyone realize that federal and local governments picked up the bill for the following: policework at the scene; road repair and road kill clean up; transport of the bodies (expensive ambulances probably); the hours the medical examiners spent; whatever preservation techniques were used before burial; the investigation into who the alien was; the costs of transport back to the hole in the ground; the actual burial. </p>
<p>When you add all of that up, we are looking at at least 10,000 dollars. The average private taxpayer doesn&rsquo;t pay that much in an entire year to all governments for all taxes. </p>
<p>Sweet: illegal alien shows up, gets smoked = a year&rsquo;s worth of my taxes. </p>
<p>A DISGRACE! SHUT IT DOWN NOW. </p>

			<p>Oh, and I forgot to say that when the 10% are IDed as foreign nationals, let their home countries bear all expenses associated with disinterment, ID verification, and repatriation.</p>

			<p>These people are getting buried?  We are paying for funerals and apportioning land to illegal immigrants when it costs so much for a plot and a funeral for a citizen?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see how we can survive as a nation or even a world with any stability when there are so many endless examples of extreme foolishness and mismanagement at all levels.</p>

			<p>These illegals should be glad that they are getting their own plot and casket; Johann Sebastian Bach&rsquo;s grave was unmarked for centuries. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was buried in a pauper&rsquo;s grave, piled in with many other bodies and not even a casket. </p>

			<p>The video link I am posting here is about legal immigration.  But everyone needs to see this to understand that ALL immigration is the problem, not just illegal immigration.</p>

			<p>They can cry me a river. No one ASKED them to come here. Note too how even in death the illegals are a burden to the state as poster DAVID TRAYWICK points out. Also I strongly suspect more then a few hit and runs are illegals. This is an underestimated problem.</p>
