<h1>James&rsquo; Controversial Comments Stir Up Latino Community</h1>
									<div align="left">

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Mecklenburg County Commissioner Bill James says he&rsquo;s not backing down after what he said about immigrants last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It all stems back to last week&rsquo;s commissioner meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t anything remotely at issue,&rdquo; James said, &ldquo;unless the real issue is to coddle illegals, suck up to a certain segment of the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner James asked the county to make local contractors use a tougher social security verification system.</p>
<p>He says it would crack down on illegal immigrants using fake social security numbers to get a job.</p>
<p>But commissioners disagreed, saying the system wasn&rsquo;t reliable and would only create more stress on employers.</p>
<p>Then came these comments.</p>
<p>James said, &ldquo;Illegal immigrants do pay taxes..so do prostitutes and drug dealers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Latino advocate Maudia Melendez thinks the comments were offensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This needs to stop deragatory statements, directed at the community should not come from an official,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>But Commissioner James says he doesn&rsquo;t care if he offended anyone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what ethnic background you&rsquo;re from, you follow the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of building bridges we are breaking bridges,&rdquo; Melendez said. She agrees illegal immigration needs to be dealt with, but in a different way, &ldquo;by intelligent, compassionate people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James said, &ldquo;if you want to drive home the fact of what&rsquo;s really going on, you got to give it to them straight.<br/>

			<p>Please, please, please; don&rsquo;t back down. James Watson backed down, to his shame, and it didn&rsquo;t save him.</p>
<p>A few days ago Amren published an article by David Bullard, who was sacked by the South African paper, the Sunday Times, for writing it.  I wrote at the time that it seemed atypical of his work.  He has now apologized. Just a flash in the pan. White men need to rediscover their pride.</p>

			<p>Racist? PLEASE! The TRUTH knows no race. Commissioner James should be commended. He willing to stand up to bullies and REAL racists. Illegal aliens are destroying our country and culture. Sure, they do menial/manual labor, but at what ACTUAL cost? They work for less than standard wages, yet suck up city, county, State and federal welfare dollars. They committed a CRIME by coming here and they contribute to crime by being here. Our school systems are bursting at the seams with children who don&rsquo;t want to assimilate into our culture or learn our language. Our jails and Police Departments are strapped, attempting to deal with their gangs and illegal activities. Where does it stop?<br/>
Commissioner James, please stick to your guns and keep telling the truth. </p>

			<p>I wish more white people would speak up like this because I have a sneaky suspicion that most white Americans feel the same way but decide not to say anything for fear of being called a bigot. Do not let Latino advocate groups put fear into you or else they win. The more white people that speak their mind on this issue, the better.</p>

			<p>Below is an excerpt of a news story on today&rsquo;s Houston KHOU website news stories&hellip; All that p.c. garbage about &#8220;honest people coming to better themselves&#8221; and so on&hellip; we sure get a hell of a lot of news stories like this one. Houston, of course, has a very large population of Mexicans   &mdash;   mostly illegals, of cuss.</p>
<p>KHOU.com staff report </p>
<p>SOUTH HOUSTON, Texas   &mdash;   South Houston police on Thursday released sketches of two men they say attacked and raped a 17-year-old girl as she walked home from school. </p>
<p>The two men, described as Hispanic males with medium builds and 5 foot 8 inches to 6 feet tall were sketched based on descriptions given by the South Houston High School teen who was attacked Monday afternoon. </p>
<p> <br/>
South Houston Police</p>
<p>Sketches of the South Houston attackers were released Thursday by police. Anyone with information should contact the South Houston Police Department at (713) 944-1910. <br/>
The attackers were in a late-model Toyota Camry with a brown cloth interior said police. The driver was wearing a tan hat and is missing a front tooth, while his companion was dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans. <br/>

			<p>Haven&rsquo;t the feminists told us for the last 40 or 50 years that prostitution is a way of living and making money like others and that prostitutes are just hard-working women who deserve our respect? How can a comparison between prostitutes and illegal immigrants then be an insult to the latter?</p>

<p>Melendez wants to build bridges around lawbreaking, but she lacks the intellectual clarity to realize it. </p>
<p>She is another one of America&rsquo;s poorly chosen officials who believe that, depending on one&rsquo;s own feelings, laws can be only optionally enforced.</p>

			<p>All these Mexicans who think that the comments of James were offensive  &mdash;  the theft of Americans taxes to pay for the unbeleivable amount of social services illegal aliens receive is offensive,truly offensive.</p>

			<p>&#8216;And since when did &#8220;prostitutes and drug dealers&#8221; pay taxes?&rsquo;  &mdash;  Wild Eyed Charlie. </p>
<p>Illegal immigrants, prostitutes, and drug dealers routinely evade state and federal income taxes and social security taxes in a big way, although many illegals do make contributions to social security that theoretically never will be credited to their non-existent personas for future drawing of benefits. (though there are moves underway to &#8220;rectify&#8221; that situation under the pending stealth Social Security Totalization agreement with Mexico)</p>
<p>That said, it still should be noted that illegal immigrants, prostitutes, and drug dealers do in fact pay SOME taxes. They pay sales and excise taxes every time they purchase a taxable item and assuming that they pay rent in non-government housing (not always the case) they pay property taxes in most jurisdictions. Also if they have a vehicle with valid tags, they pay vehicle property taxes. But having said all of that, I think that I can fairly assert that prostitutes and drug dealers are not as prone to practice ID theft (although many do engage in this for finacial card fraud and arrest warrant evasion purposes) which really screws up the lives of a lot of people even if the ID theft is only done in order to get a &#8220;job we Americans refuse to do&#8221;. Drug dealers and prostitutes also don&rsquo;t exert downward wage pressure on the legal labor markets.  And of course illegal aliens are well represented within the ranks of &#8220;prostitutes and drug dealers&#8221;. So it could be that native &#8220;prostitutes and drug dealers&#8221; are a higher strata of society than garden variety illegal aliens. Commissioner James may very well have been overly charitible in his comparisons.</p>

<p>Does she mean the way the Mexicans deal with illegals in their country?</p>
<p>If she doesn&rsquo;t like the way things are done here, she can always go home.  And, if she was born in this country, she doesn&rsquo;t belong here, because here loyalty is with her race and country of origin, not this country.</p>

			<p>Illegal immigration needs to be dealt with by intelligent, compassionate people, who will give thirty million border criminals, wage depressors, tax, document and identity fraud criminals AMNESTY.   &mdash;  YOURS TRULY,LA RAZA, MECHA, LULAC,etc.</p>

			<p>Calling a phrase or statement &#8220;offensive&#8221; has become nothing more than a way of shutting down political debate. I don&rsquo;t care if the comparison is slightly off or somewhat offensive, the threat to our political discussion is far worse than the threat of Latinos taking offense.</p>
<p>These people don&rsquo;t want us to discuss illegal or mass immigration, and they know that when a full discussion is had the open borders freaks always lose.</p>
<p>Oh, and BTW, I am offended by the suggestion that I, as an American, am too lazy to do certain jobs or am not breeding enough. So in any of your future remarks you dare sugget otherwise I will be demanding an immediate apology.</p>
