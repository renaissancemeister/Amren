						<p>A University of New Mexico professor who had planned to lead a workshop on &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; at a conference Thursday has withdrawn from the event, organizers said. </p>
<p>The decision followed complaints from about a dozen Sandia National Laboratories employees who said they were upset by a description of the workshop circulated by e-mail to lab workers. </p>
<p>The description says that, &ldquo;Recent studies suggest that whites&rsquo; lack of awareness of other cultures has to do with whites&rsquo; commitment to maintaining higher social status, or &lsquo;white privilege.&rsquo; &ldquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The response to the workshop shows &ldquo;we have more work to do,&rdquo; said Dr. Charles Becknell, chairman of the Diversity Leadership Council. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we were further along than that,&rdquo; he said Tuesday. &ldquo;I thought we could have a dialogue about these things.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The purpose of the forum is to promote diversity and tolerance in the workplace, he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;White privilege&rdquo; workshops are a staple at diversity forums, said Rita Martinez-Purson, dean of UNM&rsquo;s Continuing Education, which organized the forum. </p>

					<p>Yes, whites have the &#8220;privilege&#8221; of being told that they are bad people simply by virtue of the fact that they are white, and according to some other person&rsquo;s contrived history, whites are always the bad guy.  </p>

<p>But you don&rsquo;t want dialogue.  You want to dictate the terms.  You present your unsubstantiated opinions as hard facts.  You want no counterarguments.  </p>

<p>Y&rsquo;know, in the few years since my &#8220;awakening&#8221;, I&rsquo;ve <strong>never</strong> found a definitive example of &#8220;white privelege&#8221; outside the usual mumbo-jumbo about how there&rsquo;s no such thing as &#8220;driving while white&#8221; (well, not outside South Africa anyway).</p>

					<p>Kudos to Sandia Laboratory employees for exhibiting common sense.  This concept of white privelege is nothing but rubbish.  Most who succeed in America succeed as a result of a combination of factors such as working hard, educational attainment, and a disciplined life style.  These are the values all agree are important to impart to young people.  But, when the rewards of living an exemplary life redound to these stellar individuals, they become targets of leftists who despise the achievers in our society  &mdash;  leftists who wish to redistribute wealth to the undeserving.</p>

<p>Are we far enough along for that discussion professor? Can we have a dialogoue about these things too?</p>

					<p>Every university and company now has these reeducation seminars to make white Americans feel guilty.  </p>
<p>If anything, it&rsquo;s even worse in New Mexico than most other places because that state, like Arizona and California (even Texas these days, sadly enough) is becoming a little 3rd World colony.  The white population has dwindled so rapidly compared to the rest of the population, that it&rsquo;s whites more than anyone else, who suffer from discrimination by those in power.  The irony being that even with whites in the state now bing a minority themselves, but they <strong>still</strong> get trashed for being &#8220;economically privileged.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I knew a guy who worked at Los Alamos in New Mexico  &mdash;   brilliant, a PhD scientist and a leader in his field.  But he couldn&rsquo;t bear the prospect of raising his children in the state.  However, when he tried to move elsewhere in the country, he found that practically the entire <span class="caps">USA </span>was being inundated with the 3rd world, with the attendant dumbing-down of the curriculum everywhere you go.  And it hits private schools as well, since they all get some public funding and must deal with &#8220;diversity mandates.&#8221;  </p>
<p>So he ultimately left the country altogether  &mdash;   he started working in northeastern Germany, though now as I recall, he&rsquo;s moved to Switzerland.  A place with a similar, advanced technical culture but better schools and a better standard of living, plus a salary in Euros.  White Americans don&rsquo;t want to live in a place where we&rsquo;ll just be inundated, to the detriment of our children!</p>

					<p>This healthy and justified rebellion by the employees of Sandia National Laboratories reminds me of my own breakthrough, when I couldn&rsquo;t take it any longer, took a stand, and broke on through to the other side. </p>
<p>All of this drivel about &#8220;white privilege&#8221; began in the 1960&rsquo;s. It was started by an eccentric communist named Theodore W. Allen (1919 - 2005), a middle class dropout who felt &#8220;proletarianized by the Great Depression&#8221; and worked with labor unions for most of his adult life. He also wrote for far left periodicals and corresponded with a young Noel Ignatiev, who in the 1960&rsquo;s went by the pen name Noel Ignatin. It was as far back as 1965 that Allen started using the term &#8220;white skin privilege&#8221; in printed material. His writings became very popular with the radical <span class="caps">SDS, </span>and their offshoot, the Weatherman. The Weathermen radicals would talk of stripping themselves of &#8220;white skin privilege&#8221; and held abstract debates at their &#8220;War Councils&#8221; about killing white babies as a revolutionary act, the logical conclusion of a sick worldview, it would seem. These ideas caught on with the left-wing in academia, but didn&rsquo;t flower until many years later, mostly the late 1980&rsquo;s and 1990&rsquo;s. Routledge Publishers and Verso Books published their works. </p>
<p>In the 1990&rsquo;s, these books were stocked in every Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble, and I just knew that notions of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; would only get more and more popular. Noel Ignatiev was publishing his own little magazine called Race Traitor. Theodore Allen published his two volume &#8220;The Invention of the White Race&#8221;. Years ago, you could just ignore such radical hot air, but by the 1990&rsquo;s many schools and employers were making anti-racist diversity training (brainwashing) mandatory. In 1995 I decided to subscribe to American Renaissance. I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. Even cultural institutions like the Whitney Museum and the International Center of Photography had exhibits with themes of &#8220;whiteness&#8221;.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m heartened that the employees of Sandia Labs are fighting back. How much cultural poison can you take? <br>

					<p>When I was at doing some guardian training this year, a black woman gave a &#8220;cultural awareness&#8221; talk for about an hour.  I put her on the spot when I could and she tried to come back at me but she was obviously off balance, surprised to have me and several others challenging her.  She really didn&rsquo;t know much about different cultures, she was just pushing the philosophy that we ought to invite them all into our lives.  After the class I heard her make a comment that included the mention of &#8220;white privilege.&#8221;  I jumped right on it and informed her that I had never experienced anything but slaming doors whenever I applied to any public program or job since 1971 when I was 19.  I told her the notion was a myth that people with inferiority complexes use to hammer whites - especially white men with, rather than work on their own persoanl issues.  For them, it has to be a racial issue; facing themselves is that terrible.  But they will never, ever succeed in improving themselves as long as they just cry about &#8220;white privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as we see Somalis and American blacks fighting in Virginia, white oppressors will be replaced with black oppressors.  But the people who created and man this ridiculous industry of Diversity Counseling.</p>

					<p>I was in the Navy up in Maine a couple of years ago and had to attend a mandatory class that was similar although it wasn&rsquo;t called a Diversity Seminar.  Our instructor was a White officer from New Orleans and I could judge by his soft spoken, almost feminine voice that he was gay. The lecture was beyond offensive.  He asked the minorities (75% of the class) if they ever felt uncomfortable at work for any reason.  He then instructed them how to go about reporting any offense, no matter how slight, to the proper authorities.  He asked the class how many were married to someone of a different race and whether they were mistreated or felt uncomfortable out in town.  Remember, this is Maine, so he&rsquo;s talking about White people mistreating them.  He then went on to compliment them on their miscegenation and speaking about how wonderful it was. It was just one assault after the other and I felt like I and every White in that room was being demonized.  I didn&rsquo;t participate and just sat there not saying a word.  If I had, I know my CO would have made me sorry I ever opened my mouth.  This is the kind of brainwashing that&rsquo;s going on in the military.  I&rsquo;ve been out for nearly a year now and many times thought about writing my Congressman about the whole episode but still worry about retaliation. </p>

					<p>The beauty of the internet is that people get the opinions of all spectrums of dissent and the arguments against the fallacy of white privlige is armed by this and other websites that basically say it&rsquo;s ok to dissent and here are some effective arguments for when the leftists show up.<br>
  the reason the politically correct want to censor the net is not that we&rsquo;re wrong but that their accusations of Racist&rsquo;s, facists and all that is losing its sting simply because they cannot isolate their victim and make him/her seem like the only one in the room.</p>

					<p>I would like any of these idiots to explain exactly to me how I have benefited from &#8220;white privilege&#8221; in my solidly lower-middle class upbringing.  I know that being a white male, I apparently have original sin and I am personally responsible for all of the wars, racism, slavery, famine and death throughout history.  Furthermore I allegedly purposely plotted to destroy the great African kingdoms of pyramid builders, engineers and philosophers and have Caucasians claim these great advances for themselves while irrevocably destroying black culture from which it has never recovered today.</p>
<p>The assumption of guilt is an exclusively white phenomenon.  Funnily enough, when you point out the massive overrepresentation in black crime and want to accurately judge the much higher risks of being around blacks, the response is always &#8220;you can&rsquo;t judge them all from a few bad ones&#8221; or &#8220;whites commit crimes too&#8221;.</p>

					<p>Charging whites with lack of awareness of other cultures is ridiculous. Europeans were always the explorers, curious about other lands. Only in America &amp; Europe do you find significant museums devoted to Asia or Africa. How many African states have museums devoted to Western culture? Western culture is the most intellectually expansive in the world, while many Asians, for example, are incurious and insular. </p>

<p>?Yes we have had people and groups very hard at work, literally tirelessly working to take our rights away. It is our right to excercise our own self determination &#8220;by any means&#8221; regardless of what has been &#8220;planned&#8221; for us.

					<p>Just today I completed a &#8220;mini diversity training&#8221; program within a college course.  It&rsquo;s thinly veiled white bashing.  That&rsquo;s really all it is.  I have a couple of pages of printed material that supposedly outlines cultural differences between blacks, whites, hispanics and native Americans.  I asked the instructor if those self same cultural differences might account for different numbers of each group pursuing different careers (and, if so, being &#8220;underrepresented&#8221; is not necessarily a sign of discrimination).  It took him a while to figure out what I was saying - then he said &#8220;personality type&#8221; is the major factor in such things (as if &#8220;personality type&#8221; is not impacted, at all, by culture.  It&rsquo;s truly amazing how otherwise intelligent people are so blind to the built-in contradictions of the diversity cult.  The last trait on the list was &#8220;awareness of undeserved white privilege&#8221;.  Another trait was &#8220;to what extent to people define themselves based on their skin color/race&#8221;.  Whites were rated at &#8220;very little&#8221; and blacks/hispanics were rated at &#8220;very much&#8221; and the instructor attributed this to &#8220;being discriminated against&#8221;.  If anybody wants a copy of those two pages for as intellectual ammo or just for kicks, just email me.</p>

					<p>Casey James,</p>
<p>While I appreciate most everyone&rsquo;s posts, yours really speaks to me.  I like what you have to say.  I have a family with a bunch of kids.  And even in our white suburb, the schools still push the celebrate diversity routine.  I really don&rsquo;t watch much TV but good grief, the diversity propaganda still gets out it&rsquo;s so prevalent.  You don&rsquo;t need someone to tell you ice cream is great.  But apparently they need a billion dollar propaganda campaign to make people think diversity is.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;re considering moving out of the US or to a more remote area in the <span class="caps">US.  </span></p>
<p>For me, the thing is, I want to feel patriotic.  I&rsquo;m happy to pay my taxes, contribute to the economy and be a model citizen treating people with courtesy and respect.  But it&rsquo;s obvious we&rsquo;re just a source of tax and corporate revenue. Nothing more. When it comes to presidential candidates, all I see is 3 people pandering to everyone except me and my family, we don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>That said I&rsquo;m strongly considering moving our family to Europe.  In due time because of the poor education in this country and Fortune 500 companies being more interested in social causes rather than producing a good product, the US will lag behind the rest of the developed nations.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just tired of feeling like a man without a country.  </p>
<p>So please keep talking, it really inspires hope.</p>

					<p>These types of mandatory seminars were abandoned at American Express over 8 years ago because they were actually causing &#8220;diversity&#8221; problems in departments where none had existed before.  They still keep them for people who&rsquo;ve commited an egregious enough diversity faux paus as an alternative to firing.</p>

					<p>I totally commend that professor and the employees for backing out of that anti-white brainwashing (a.k.a. diversity seminar).  These people aren&rsquo;t fools.  They know what this diversity training is really all about - forcing whites into self-hatred and guilt.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;d like a copy of them.  Can you send them via your scanner?  If not, I can give you a snail mail address and would be glad to reimburse you for the cost of postage and copy fees.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re confronted with sounds like what the university in Gainesville is guilty of, only they&rsquo;re probably further to the left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to show the info to my neighbors and friends. </p>

					<p>jewamongyou, that was a very good rebuttal.  </p>
<p>I wish more people would openly challange the propaganda out there.  My advice to people being pressured to attend these seminars is refuse to attend like those at Sandia Laboratories or attend but be prepared to rise up and challenge the attempt at indoctrination.</p>

					<p>It seems the workers at Sandia Labs can expect an influx of diversity in the near future.  In the interests of supporting diversity our tax dollars must provide high paying career jobs for non whites. </p>
<p>All you White Privilege lab techs at Sandia Labs will find yourselves subservient to a Supervisory task force of diverse dolts who can barely read their long checklist of things for you to comply with. </p>

					<p>Fellow readers, what none of you have made note of is this: The diversity pushers clump us all into the same category. &#8220;White&#8221;.  How convenient!  Yet it does not account for the very diversity we have among ourselves.  Some of us are Jewish, some Christian, some something else or no religion at all.  Some of us are descended from Italians, or are Scots-Irish, or are Scandinavian.  Some are heterosexual, some are homosexual.  Yet, the common thing with these diversity-mongers is they see us as &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>
<p>They are just as guilty as we are <span class="caps">ALLEGED </span>to be about other races or ethnic groups.  They either do not realize, or purposely disregard the <span class="caps">FACT </span>that I would never be accepted in some circles, or in some jobs, as other whites might be because of who I am or what I am.</p>
<p>I as well am considering leaving for another country; I am just not srue where. While the United States is one of the most beautiful lands in the world, there is little to keep me here.  </p>

					<p>What if workplace &#8220;Diversity Training&#8221; taught about &#8220;Black Privilege&#8221;, citing in this case actual <span class="caps">FACTS </span>such as racial preferences for blacks? And talked about &#8220;blacks&rsquo; commitment to maintaining higher social status, or &lsquo;black privilege.&rsquo;&#8221; <br>
Do you suppose black employees would protest? </p>
<p>Then the organizers of this training could respond with &ldquo;we have more work to do,&rdquo; and &#8220;I thought we were further along than that,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I thought we could have a dialogue about these things.&rdquo; </p>
<p>How galling it is that white employees are legally discriminated against in hiring and promotions, and as though that were not enough, then this &#8220;training&#8221; is instituted to foment racial hostility against them and they are told that <span class="caps">THEY </span>are the &#8220;privileged&#8221; ones, the exact <span class="caps">INVERSE </span>of the truth!<br>

					<p>&ldquo;I thought we were further along than that,&rdquo; he said Tuesday. </p>
<p>- We are farther along, which is why people are recognizing that this is brainwashing. These activists want to live in 1908, and a fictional 1908 at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we could have a dialogue about these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Sorry, not a &#8220;dialogue&#8221; when its a one way conversation and any questioning gets one branded as &#8220;racist&#8221;, which at a workplace would be the kiss of death.</p>

					<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;The diversity pushers clump us all into the same category. &ldquo;White&rdquo;. How convenient! Yet it does not account for the very diversity we have among ourselves. Some of us are Jewish,&hellip;<i></i></i></p>
<p>Correction, Friendly Grizzly, <span class="caps">NONE</span> OF US are Jewish.  Jews are and always have been very, <span class="caps">VERY </span>mixed race (Western Asians with varying degrees of Black and Caucasian blood mixed in).  The term &#8220;sportin&rsquo; the Jew Fro&#8221; (in referring to their own hair [quote by Jewish actor Jeremy Piven]) exists for a reason.  Eisenhower was exposed as a Jew at West Point after he popped positive for Asian blood during a routine blood test (don&rsquo;t even need <span class="caps">DNA </span>to determine race).  It was only heavy pressure and threats behind the scenes from Jews that kept him enrolled as a cadet, because, as a non-White, he was not eligible for admittance at any of the Service academies at the time.  Only Caucasians are White.  If you&rsquo;re not all White, you&rsquo;re not White at all.</p>
