						<p>Ugandans who want a career in the United States military, can sign up at the annual convention of the Uganda North American Association, organisers say.</p>
<p>American military recruiters will set up a booth at this year&rsquo;s UNAA convention in Orlando, Florida, and seek out professional Ugandans, said Lt. Frank Musisi, himself an officer in the US Army.</p>
<p>Lt. Musisi, who comes from Kalangala District on Lake Victoria, is the current president of UNAA. He said the US military would also advise Ugandans on the &#8220;proper channels&#8221; to follow in enlisting. The announcement, which is also on the UNAA website (www.unaa.net), is set to cause a rush to this year&rsquo;s convention that takes place from August 29 to September 1.</p>
<p>UNAA is encouraging interested Ugandans to book flights to Orlando and take a shot at joining the US military. The organisation says it has made a deal with Kenya Airways/KLM for a discounted return ticket at $1,200 (Sh74,400). The conference fee is $190 (Sh11,700).</p>
<p>&#8220;All registered Kampala travel agents have been authorised to book intending members,&#8221; Lt. Musisi said in an email interview.</p>
<p>The tour firm Let&rsquo;s Go Travel confirmed to Saturday Monitor that UNAA had circulated a notice of the discounts. Applicants are being asked to carry their curriculum vitae (CV) suggesting that the recruitment exercise will be a main attraction at the convention.</p>
<p>Public interest in jobs abroad in Uganda is intense. Recruitment and job placement companies which advertise are often flooded with thousands of applications.<br>

					<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see where this is headed. Thousands of Ugandans are going to get visas to fly from Uganda to Orlando ostensibly to be recruited into the US Army. Most will wind up as non-inductee visa overstayers.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s in Spanish, but this particular blog features a bunch of Mexican bloggers bantering about their favorite Mexican Narco Cartel heroes; dead, captured, or still at large and in business.<br>
And it is sponsored by none other than our US Army Recruiting Division!</p>

					<p>Good news&hellip;.in a way. When the government decides to arrest us race realists and White Nationalists for &#8220;Hate Crimes&#8221; atleast the troops will be black. It would add insult to injury if my trip to the gulag was with a White man pointing a M-16 at me. A little more comforting to know the soldier will be a non-white and most likely non-Christian.</p>

					<p>Isn&rsquo;t this just great&hellip;.Our military recruiting Black foreigners! Don&rsquo;t we have enough of our own &#8220;citizens&#8221; in the military that are foreign to us? Just think they are all eligible then to become <span class="caps">U.S. </span>citizens and all their families will be imported here! It&rsquo;s bad enough with our so-called Christian churches flooding us with refugees, now we have the military doing it? If White Americans still think this is not a <span class="caps">DELIBERATE </span>plan by the puppet masters to destroy the White race and nations, then they are total brainwashed fools!</p>

<p>This situation is wrong on so many levels that it is difficult to know where to begin. Language barriers, loyalty, crime statistics, etc.</p>
<p>In the end, however, our government will feel obliged to give these Ugandan soldiers of fortune a head-of-the-line pass in becoming US citizens. Once their military careers are over (for whatever reason), you know the Ugandans won&rsquo;t be sent back to Africa - they will be moving into our neighborhoods. </p>
<p>This is a really <span class="caps">BAD </span>idea.</p>

* &#8220;Japanese police officers arrested on Thursday a <span class="caps">U.S. </span>sailor in the death of a taxi driver near an American naval base outside Tokyo last month. Masaaki Takahashi, 61, was found dead in his taxi with stabs wounds in his neck, police officials said. The arrested sailor was identified by the Police in Kanagawa, near Tokyo, as Olatunbosun Ugbogu, 22. Apparently, he robbed the taxi driver and then he killed him&hellip;</p>
<p>Ugbogu, who is a Nigerian national, was in <span class="caps">U.S. </span>military custody on a charge of dissertation and was handed over to Japanese police by accord with <span class="caps">U.S. </span>authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>* (ENews.com, 4 - 3 - 08)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope the Ugandans are better behaved than the Nigerians.  After all, they are representing our country abroad. </p>

					<p>Why aren&rsquo;t we recruiting from white first world countries first?</p>
<p>&#8220;Public interest in jobs abroad in Uganda is intense. Recruitment and job placement companies which advertise are often flooded with thousands of applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>So intense desperation and $2300 buys an interview? Sounds so fishy it might be true. Then again, maybe just a scam to separate the poor from their cash. The story doesn&rsquo;t say whether citizenship is part of the deal. Be sure and read &#8216;who we are&rsquo; from the homepage at the link to allafrica.com. </p>
<p>Uganda? Madness.</p>

					<p>This is utterly incredible, the idea that the armed forces of the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>would recruit non-U.S. citizens for active military duty, and of course, wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, they&rsquo;re not trying to recruit Europeans, they&rsquo;re attempting to get third worlders from places like Uganda.  Don&rsquo;t they have cannibalism in Uganda?  I&rsquo;ve read stories about Idi Amin having his enemies killed and then feasting on them. (shades of Dr. Hannibal Lechter)The insanity just never stops!  It only gets worse.  How far can this lunacy go??</p>

					<p><span class="caps">THE BEGINNING</span> OF <span class="caps">THE END</span>!  I ask the reader to think of the late Roman period, where the Romans began to heavily enlist Barbarians into the legions just before the Empire&rsquo;s collapse.  This is exactly the same situations, where these Africans are the barbarians.  They don&rsquo;t care about our country.  So we plan on hiring foreign mercenaries to be in our army now?  This is insane.  Besides, Africans aren&rsquo;t known to be efficient soldiers.  They will probably just spread <span class="caps">AIDS </span>in Iraq and promote corruption. I&rsquo;m sure the US Gov&rsquo;t or these Ugandans will insist on US citizenship after serving. I love America, but I&rsquo;m sorry to admit that when I hear things like this, I think that I&rsquo;ll give this country another 10 years and move out.  Do my children really have a future here?  Our cities are becoming so diverse, I don&rsquo;t want my children infected by our media&rsquo;s toxic liberalism or my daughter marrying some guy named Tyrique from Harlem.</p>

<p>What an understatement.  This is a country where people are grateful for electric lights, because it makes it easier to catch grasshoppers for a tasty snack.</p>
<p>Idle losers from all corners of Africa know there exists the possibility they can use the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Army as a back-door into American citizenship.  The program should be abolished, because it gives too much away to what are essentially opportunists.</p>

 What I remember from the fall of Kampala and his presidential palace being sacked was this&hellip; The news media came out with the story that rebel forces had found reels and reels of Tom and Jerry cartoons in a closet in the palace.  Apparently Mr. Big would watch a cartoon and then do to prisoners whatever Tom and Jerry did to each other. Anvil anyone?!? </p>

					<p>      Why not? It is a logical development for a &#8220;nation&#8221; that<br>
exports whole industries, and insources profesionals to undercut<br><br>
American workers. They are also recruiting in Mexico and the<br><br>
Phillipines. Such soldiers may even be preferable: they will<br><br>
have no compunction about firing on Americans. But, there is a<br><br>
bright side. Like all mercenaries, they will cut and run when<br><br>
the going gets tough. And-I cannot believe they will be any match<br><br>
for our own White Troops should it come to that.</p>

					<p>Ah, yes, Rome right before the collapse, c. 450 <span class="caps">A.D., </span>transplanted to the <span class="caps">USA </span>in 2008.  Bringing in the barbarian hordes to fight our imperial wars.  Except that, of course, the barbarians always want a piece of the action when they&rsquo;ve rendered their service.  Meaning full residency in the <span class="caps">USA, </span>citizenship, affirmative action and welfare benefits.  And just like underdog says, most of the Ugandans won&rsquo;t even do service in the US military, they&rsquo;ll leech off us for a while and then wind up stuck here as &#8220;back-up personnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a barbecue recently with a number of my neighbors during the <span class="caps">NCAA </span>championship, the conversation turned serious during halftime, and we talked about the mounting disasters in the <span class="caps">USA, </span>and where we&rsquo;d want to raise our kids.  One of the families on our block actually did emigrate  &mdash;   to Chile interestingly enough  &mdash;   and we pondered the same issue.  The truth is, the <span class="caps">USA </span>is toast, and not just demographically.  There will be a non-white majority in about 15 years with all the strife and disaster that entails, but just as bad, our national debt is skyrocketing so high that the interest alone will bankrupt us by 2020  &mdash;   and whoever&rsquo;s left in the <span class="caps">USA </span>at that point, will basically have to pay those debts, i.e. be extorted by the government to make up the shortfall.  </p>
<p><span class="caps">IOW, </span>this is not a place we want to raise our kids in.  Canada and Australia aren&rsquo;t possibilities either  &mdash;   they&rsquo;re going non-white majority even faster than the <span class="caps">USA, </span>with such an abysmal white fertility rate that half of the babies born in those countries will soon be to non-whites invited into the country in the past 50 years.  They&rsquo;re also hitched to the crumbling US debt-ridden economy, esp. Canada.  In Europe, countries like France, Britain and Sweden are obviously toast demographically as they become the first nations of Eurabia, while they bankrupt themselves economically.  Other than that, maybe some small countries in Europe (which tend to have stricter and more nationalist immigration policies) will survive  &mdash;   Denmark, Finland, Austria, Iceland, Switzerland, Portugal.  Italy, actually, has a strong nationalist movement and will probably survive.  Hungary and Romania will be intact.  Probably Germany will make it too  &mdash;   at least once they get rid of that fool Angela Merkel  &mdash;   since most Turkish guest-workers in Germany are actually going home, though Germany may have a Muslim riot in Hamburg here and there prior to stabilizing as an at least decent white nation.</p>
<p>We agreed that if anything, maybe South America might be the most ethnically white region of the world in 20 years  &mdash;   especially Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.  They&rsquo;ve had their own economic headaches but since they don&rsquo;t have imperial pretensions, they should be fine, especially with an infusion of hard-working whites seeking refuge from elsewhere.  Maybe time to get some audiotapes in Spanish or German or something, to prepare for the fall.  Or at least, to move my kids somewhere where they won&rsquo;t be robbed of their own heritage!</p>

					<p>Our depleted military has been recruiting Africans and other foreigners for years. The Washington Post recently reported on a <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Navy seaman named Olatunbosun Ugbogu from Nigeria. Ugbogu is a citizen of Nigeria and while he was in Tokyo last week he got a taxi ride. It was quite a ride. At the end, the sixty year old cabbie wanted $190. Ugbogu decided it would be better for him to kill the cabbie than pay him. The cabbie is now dead and Ugbogu has been arrested and Japan is furious. </p>
<p>Several weeks ago, another Black <span class="caps">U.S. </span>serviceman raped and killed a 12 year old Japanese girl.</p>

					<p>I don&rsquo;t think Ugandans are well behaved. </p>
<p>At the end of 19th century they were about as nice as Shaka Zulu&rsquo;s warriors. Burying wives and slaves alive with their kings, sacrificing boys to every new moon, a bit of ceremonial cannibalism here and there, selling one another to Arab slavers&hellip; Half century after that, Idi Amins reign of terror also didn&rsquo;t show any improvements in the local manners, did it?</p>

<p>The military is to be made up of citizens.  That has been fudged by allowing in too many immigrants, a sizable portion who go straight into the military, but actually recruiting abroad for non-citizens is absolutely against our constitution.</p>

					<p>To: Casey James - Europe is a very good choice to move to, especially Southern countries like Italy, Greece, and why not my country Bulgaria. There are many British people who come live here when they retire because they can buy a cheap house in a small village or on the seaside and the nature is very beautiful. Since we joined the EU the salaries have gone up. For instance I get $1800 per month on which I can live very comfortably and Westerners usually get higher salaries than Bulgarians.</p>

Meanwhile the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>has a broken border at its own doorstep and faces an emotionally hostile Mexico with irredentist views. It is the interventionist foreign policies of the imperial American Hegemony that causes terrorism. The presence of American troops in the Arabian peninsula was the number one grievance of Bin Laden. Americans just don&rsquo;t learn.</p>

					<p>To Howard In Las Vegas&hellip;&hellip;.That is correct. Think our <span class="caps">WHITE </span>military men will do to us what the Black military men will do? Doesn&rsquo;t anybody get it yet? <span class="caps">THIS </span>is the <span class="caps">PLAN.</span> Do you see martial law in the very near future?<br>

A sobering thought!  I have been in Uganda, and I have seen Ugandan troops.  Believe me, these are <span class="caps">NOT </span>what we would want &#8220;guarding&#8221; us and our liberties in the <span class="caps">USA. </span> What an insanely dangerous proposal!  I can hardly believe it. What kind of fools are running this country?</p>
<p>This is all an outgrowth of the prevailing ideology that all humans are the same and interchangeable, that one body is the same as another. Just bodies, whether for military or economic purposes. Consumers, producers, voters, parishioners, soldiers   &mdash;    any body will do. <br>

					<p>Let&rsquo;s hope the Ugandans are better behaved than the Nigerians. After all, they are representing our country abroad. </p>
<p>Ronald</p>
<p>No!!! they are not better behaved. Put 25 of each nation together and mix them up and you cannot tell them apart. </p>

					<p>Or am I comepletely incapable of understanding the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Constitution.</p>
<p>  <span class="caps">VOID WHERE PROHIBITED</span> BY <span class="caps">LAW </span>or, it would seem, by political expediency. I also concur with the analogy to ancient Rome relative to the condition of the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>now, and as foreigners take over our country and we pay the tribute, one of them will &#8220;throw their sword on the scales&#8221;</p>
