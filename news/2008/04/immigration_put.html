<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The eyes of Europe are on Birmingham as it becomes the continent&rsquo;s first ethnic majority city, Britain&rsquo;s equalities chief has said.</p>
<p>Speaking at the same Birmingham hotel on the 40th anniversary of Enoch Powell&rsquo;s &lsquo;rivers of blood&rsquo; speech, Trevor Phillips called for a fresh debate on immigration which he said was vital for the country&rsquo;s economic future.</p>
<p>And he described how he thought Birmingham&rsquo;s unique ethnic make-up would eventually be the model for the majority of large cities in Europe.</p>
<p>Mr Phillips, chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, described the prospect of ethnic minorities becoming the majority of Birmingham&rsquo;s population as &ldquo;a very very big deal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a very important issue. It&rsquo;s important because in Europe this won&rsquo;t happen in the way it has happened in America, where one lot of people takes over from another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be a lot of groups of different ethnicities, and that is going to take a new kind of thinking. This is what most European cities in 15 or 20 years&rsquo; time will look like, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so interested in what&rsquo;s happening in Birmingham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calling for a new debate on immigration laws, Mr Phillips said mass immigration had led to a &lsquo;cold war&rsquo; between ethnic communities in Britain, and failed immigration policies risked nurturing racism.</p>
<p>He also invoked the memory of Warwick University student Kevin Gately as an example of how disputes between communities had affected him personally.</p>
<p>Mr Gately was killed in 1978 while protesting at an anti-racist demonstration in London, after students were urged into action by Mr Phillips, head of the NUS at the time. Mr Phillips said he still felt some personal responsibility for Mr Gately&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>But despite the social problems that he said immigration created, Mr Phillips said immigrants were a &lsquo;tide of talent&rsquo; that had contributed hugely to life in Britain, and were indispensable to the country&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Making his speech at the Burlington Hotel in Birmingham, where 40 years ago Enoch Powell called for the suspension of all immigration, Mr Phillips said the UK would become &ldquo;an economic backwater&rdquo; if highly-skilled immigrants were not encouraged by new legislation to come to the UK.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;If we fail, our children and our grandchildren won&rsquo;t be arguing about how many immigrants are coming in, they will be wondering how they can get a work permit into dominant economies like India and China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The real question will be whether we can, as a modern economy, seize the restless tide of talent that is currently sweeping across the globe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far we are lagging behind our competitors. While we cower in fear and fret about whether to admit clever foreigners from other nations, America, Australia and Canada are already sailing on that tide of talent. Managing immigration is not always the same as reducing immigration numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Phillips&rsquo;s comments were welcomed by the crowd at the speech, which took in representatives of many local faith groups, charities and public bodies.</p>
<p>Digby, Lord Jones of Birmingham, said: &ldquo;We are built on immigration, we are a race of bastards. Birmingham is the youngest city in Europe, because we are founded on immigration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the Aston Villa players were beating their Birmingham rivals 5-1 just up the road, Mr Phillips said the Premier League could be an example of how managed immigration could be a success.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Nobody asks where players come from, only what they bring. The shared desire to win means players make compromises for the common good. The fact we have found players in our game does not make our home-grown players less bankable. None of this happens by accident. There has been control and regulation.&rdquo;<br>

<p>No, they won&rsquo;t:<br>
Immigrating to China/India is almost-impossible - does he honestly believe that either country would let in hordes of poor whites to &#8220;do the jobs native Indians/Chinese won&rsquo;t do&#8221;?</p>

<p>America and Canada are predicted to have non-white majorities *in the next twenty years*, while Australia vigorously follows the folly of becoming &#8220;a majority-Asian country&#8221;.</p>
<p>See where he&rsquo;s going with this?</p>
<p>He just wants to make sure - when the inevitable civil war happens in Britain - &#8220;his&#8221; side has enough manpower to claw their way to the top of shattered Post-Second-Civil-War Britain.</p>

			<p>But despite the social problems that he said immigration created, Mr Phillips said immigrants were a &lsquo;tide of talent&rsquo; that had contributed hugely to life in Britain, and were indispensable to the country&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>1 - They are NOT a tide of talent.  Since they come from undeveloped places they don&rsquo;t possess the skills needed to compete in a modern market.  And if Mr. Phillips would respond to that by saying, &#8220;Oh, well then, we&rsquo;ll educate them.&#8221;  Then why wouldn&rsquo;t he bother to do that with the population that&rsquo;s already there?</p>
<p>2- They do not help the economy, anymore than the immigrant invasion in China and Japan has helped their economy.  </p>
<p>They can spin, spin, spin, all they want, but that facts are irrefutable.  </p>
<p>Just as the West has moved from  a primary, secondary and tertiary economy, or, Agricultural, Production, Services economy; just as we&rsquo;ve moved from the Church, to the State, to the Corporation; so too are we moving by Race. The only difference is that it represents a degeneration, and this can be proven, easily, and they know it.  That&rsquo;s why they have no choice but to eliminate Freedom of Speech.  </p>
<p>And make no mistake about it; the Power Elite is losing as much sleep over it as we have lost over the fact that the Church is no longer the Power Center it once was.</p>
<p>There is denial, and then there&rsquo;s sincere denial.  And sincere denial is more commonly refered to as &#8220;Delusion&#8221;.  Now, either Mr. Phillips is delusional, or he is simply lying by talking out of both sides of his mouth.  How so?</p>
<p>He is calling for &#8220;Freedom of Movement&#8221; for ALL immigrants and saying that England MUST have an Open Borders Policy (sky&rsquo;s the limit). He&rsquo;s making an appeal to the Wests love for Freedom. Let&rsquo;s get this straight.  Here is a man who is considered the &#8220;Race Czar&#8221; (that in itself should be a dead give away, but apparently&hellip;) appealing to our love for Freedom by calling for &ldquo;Freedom of Movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freedom of Movement?  That Country doesn&rsquo;t even have Freedom of SPEECH for the citizens who are already there; especially for them&hellip;.Oh, wait, now I get it.</p>
<p>Come on folks!  They are Organized Crime and we are the targets of a Hit Job. Instead of a bullet or knife* they are using contracts, quotas, legislation, legal requirments, Equal Opportunity, etc.  This is how these ignoble sneaks (have you ever heard of a noble sneak?) fight a war. *The guns and knifes are used by their foot soldiers, we all know who they are.<br>

			<p>[i]He added: &ldquo;If we fail, our children and our grandchildren won&rsquo;t be arguing about how many immigrants are coming in, they will be wondering how they can get a work permit into dominant economies like India and China.[/i]</p>
<p>So either steal away all the smart Indians and Chinese to save the economy, or else go off to live with Indians or Chinese?  If you&rsquo;re going be living around them either way, why go to all the trouble of bringing them in?  </p>
<p>And if GDP is the sole measure of a country&rsquo;s worth, as Phillips&rsquo; seems to be saying, why bother trying to play catch-up with your own nation when you could just hop over to another one that is doing better?  It is like the relationship of casual stockholders to a failing corporation: why try to reform management when it is far easier to simply sell your shares and buy those of a company that is doing better?   </p>
<p>(Anyways, it has been well reported the English are already leaving in massive numbers due to the complete mismanagement of the country, but to Spain, New Zealand and France rather than India and China.  I guess that does not matter so long as the &#8220;economy&#8221; is doing well.)<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s too funny! I have to wonder if this speech is meant to intentionally be so. Leave it to the left to blame the exodus of whites from UK on the failure to have enough immigration. As the white population gets smaller and smaller it will all be blamed on &#8216;backward attitudes of the nationalists&rsquo;. I guess that&rsquo;s going to be the official line for the next 40 years, too.<br>

<p>Who does this idiot think he is to issue ultimatums to the rest of Europe?</p>
<p>How arrogant to make such a claim! He should be disbarred from his position. He has been living off of the taxpayers of Britain for how long now? Fire him!!!!</p>

<p>Is it money above all else or is the pursuit of money a cover for racial annihilation of whites?</p>

Managing immigration is not always the same as reducing immigration numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes we are riding on that tide of lettuce pickers, grass cutters, dishwashers and motel maids.  Big corporations are  also riding on a tide of greed from big corporations and the H1B visa scam that cuts homegrown talent out and replaces it with bargain basement foreign workers.   </p>
<p>This article just brings so many questions up in my mind.  Why are the British people letting this black guy dictate to them his vision for Britain?  Why is there virtually no resistance in fighting this invasion of their country?  If people really want change, why didn&rsquo;t they vote for the BNP?   </p>

			<p>They always patronize the immigrants and demonize the whites. As if that&rsquo;s going to keep their violence in check. It&rsquo;s a world-wide attitude of white-guilt now. Not discriminating against whites, and not blaming them: this is now &#8216;hate&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>I bet 20 years later when there&rsquo;s hardly any whites at all left, there will be a little journal published for the remain whites about all the &#8216;immigrant crime&rsquo;, to try and keep whites from committing crimes too. Someone has to work. And after all, a crime against a person of color, would actually be considered a real crime. </p>

			<p>&#8220;in Europe this won&rsquo;t happen in the way it has happened in America, where one lot of people takes over from another.&#8221; </p>
<p>A garden, with many varieties of flora, can only be kept from unruly competition by the ruthless application of the scythe.</p>
<p>Does England want this?  Do they desire a dictatorial central government, to police competition so that all the ethnicities are kept at par?  Only a Marxist would say such a thing.</p>

			<p>This is clearly a case of the government working against the people.  According to Trevor Phillips the English people do not have the ability to take care of themselves.  They need to be cared for by the very tribes and natives that the Empire governed and cared for.</p>
<p>But after commanding its people to slaughter in two recent World Wars, not to mention numerous previous wars, can we really believe that England&rsquo;s rulers ever cared much about its people.<br>

			<p>The eyes of Europe are on Birmingham as it becomes the continent&rsquo;s first ethnic majority </p>
<p>Are the eyes of Europe really on Birmingham or does the press want you to believe that? And to believe the eyes of Europe are on Birmingham because they are excited and eagerly anticipating  that this sort of demographic change is coming to their city next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The real question will be whether we can, as a modern economy, seize the restless tide of talent that is currently sweeping across the globe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about globalism. Trevor Phillips is a really a frontman/spokesman for our banking, corporate and media elite who have been in the process of deconstructing/destroying western society and attempting to reengineer their &#8220;one world order&#8221;  with free trade as its financial religion.  Mixing these foreign peoples of different ethnicities into western society is part of how our big financial interests are intentionally destroying it.  Political correctness keeps any opposition in check.  Affirmative action aids the mixing process.  Anti-Nationalist and pro &#8220;global citizen&#8221; propaganda teach our children that the concept of the nation state is outdated. It is a multifaceted approach.</p>

<p>Birmingham is a multiracial hell hole. Race riots, murders, Islamic Terrorism, white sex slavery, drugs, no-go areas and so on. The white population is fleeing in droves.</p>
<p>Perhaps thats Phillips idea of &#8220;success&#8221;</p>
<p>If I was looking for a model city it would be the last on my list with the poss. exception of Basrah.</p>
<p>And if we take in all the worlds brightest and best (though they seem singularly lacking in Birminghams ethnic population of Jihadists and dope smugglers) what will happen to the Third World countries they vacate? </p>
<p>People across Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Africa are dying for want of doctors, farmers, engineers etc.</p>
<p>Every skilled immigrant to the UK is one less in a country desperate for skills.</p>
<p>Their blood is on the British Governments hands</p>

			<p>&ldquo;There will be a lot of groups of different ethnicities, and that is going to take a new kind of thinking. This is what most European cities in 15 or 20 years&rsquo; time will look like, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so interested in what&rsquo;s happening in Birmingham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course he&rsquo;s interested.  If Birmingham is a failure panic will set in.  World Wide Panic.</p>
<p>But what will happen is that the MSM and people like Phillips will contiue to blame the usual suspects while covering the rest up.  The rest being their incompetence and lawlessness.  He&rsquo;s even trying to blame a man who gave a speech 40 years ago!  A speech by the way, that has obviously come true!  Doesn&rsquo;t Phillips get it?  Is he that stupid, or that delusional or that corrupt and dishonest?  Is he alergic to reality?  Maybe that&rsquo;s it; if he faces reality he&rsquo;s afraid he&rsquo;ll breakout in spots, or get a rash, or come down with a bad case of whooping cough, or something.</p>
<p>Another thing is for sure; a pattern, enormously destructive, now today more then ever, will continue to be reinforced, ie; each and every group that makes up the &#8220;happy-go-lucky-geez, aren&rsquo;t WE glad to be rid of the evil White man and so now can indulge in our Utopian fantasies and ignore our more glaring character defects&#8221; Multi-Culties, will continue to be placed above criticism!</p>
<p>People who come to Europe and America because all of their countries were spectacular failures.  I mean, how smart could they be?  People who arrive to the West thinking life comes ready-made, like a supermarket ripe for looting, that is just going to gush goodies endlessly, like a fountain or a geyser.  <br>
People, many of whom are, by our own standards, clinically retarded, and exremely violent, being placed above criticism.  I realize it is not nice to refer to anyone as stupid and violent.  But what do you do when they really ARE stupid and violent?  Can it possibly get any worse?  </p>
<p>A man in Colorado was removed from a podium recently for saying that the majority of Mexican illegals are &#8220;illiterate peasants.&#8221;  His colleagues attacked him, verbally (guess he got off easy - this time, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Tase Me Bro&#8221;).  He conferred with a dictionary; and, as far as our language goes, yep, those were well-chosen words (as if we didn&rsquo;t already know, including the people who sanctimoniously removed him from the podium).</p>
<p>We are living in The Age of Anti-Reality.  It is official.  </p>

<p>Forgive me for being picky, but Birmingham is no such thing and never can be.  Burmingham is <i>not  </i>on &#8220;the Continent&#8221;. Birmingham is in the British Isles!  </p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s the way we learned geography when I was in school.  Has even that been revised to make it more politically correct?  More acceptable to Brussels?  Birmingham used to be in a place called England.  An island!  They might as well say there is now no England.</p>

			<p>I know absolutely nothing about Birmingham except it is an English city with a dire football team.  Knowing it is 50% &#8220;minority&#8221; allows me to make some predictions about it:</p>
<p>* Overall very high crime rate, especially overrepresented in violent crimes<br>
* High unemployment rate<br>
* Very low standards of healthcare and life expectancy<br>
* Bankrupt city, very few public services<br>
* Very low educational standards - literacy, completion of secondary and tertiary studies<br>
* Very low household incomes<br>
* High rate of single parenthood and teen pregancies</p>
<p>How did I do?</p>
<p>Britain needs ZERO cities where the majority is non-white in the future.  All one needs to do is look around the world and see what happens when the demographics of a city/country change over time.</p>

			<p>ENOUGH of the lies of the liberal globalist.  I&rsquo;m surprised they haven&rsquo;t come up with a distributive system of quotas for interacial  marriages to help them lesson the &#8221; divisive effects of mono-racial families on the community.&#8221;  Maybe they will try this with the next generation.  ENOUGH of this social engineering by liberal intellectuals and their lapdog politicians who don&rsquo;t have the common sense to change a tire.</p>
<p>Go to any large city in America where non-whites are in the majority and you will see what happens as white culture disintegrates.  You have heard of white flight of course but have you heard that white flight is also accompanied by the flight of the black middle class?   Have you head that in LA hispanic gangs practice racial cleansing against American born whites AND black through random violence, crime, murder and rape?   </p>
<p>The white citizens of the United States, UK, Canada and Australia have ALL made if very clear in opinion polls taken on the subject that they don&rsquo;t want to become minorities in their own countries.  That they want immigration stopped and yet the power elites ignore their wishes.  What then should we do?   Where will our homeland be?  Nowhere. </p>

&#8220;Mr Phillips said the UK would become &ldquo;an economic backwater&rdquo; if highly-skilled immigrants were not encouraged by new legislation to come to the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
If only HIGHLY-SKILLED immigrants were permitted, that would keep at least 95% of Trevor Phillips&rsquo; fellow blacks back in Africa and the Caribbean where they belong&hellip; </p>
<p>Black immigration to Britain reduced to 1/20 of its current rate? Sounds good to me. <br>

			<p>Wanted Dead not Alive: The White Race for the crime of being superior to other groups of people.</p>
<p>This article is the Globalist agenda laid bare for all to see.  The intention now is to make Whites a minority in the largest cities of their homelands and make a buck or two in the process.  Next will be the spreading of non-Whites into the suburbs and rural farming areas.</p>
<p>By moving slowly, the globalist is able to trick his target population into believing that his fate is enivitable and that his current condition has always been the same.  The game ends when the last White is either dead or having brown children. (And Globalists still wonder why people hate them!?)</p>
<p><br>
So what path will you choose White man?  Will you do something while you still have strength of numbers or will you go gently into that &#8220;good&#8221; night?</p>

			<p>Yes, he does sound like he is talking about a corporation, rather than a country.  Other countries referred to as &#8220;competitors.&#8221;  Talking about the bottom line as though it is the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>Sbuffalonative raises a good question, too - who can really know the answer?  The one thing we do know is that the phenomenon is occurring in white countries across the world, at the same time and at roughly the same rate, and the main justification is always &#8220;the economy.&#8221;  The final triumph of corporate interests, at last, hand in hand with the cultural Marxists in government? </p>

<p>Really!  </p>
<p>1.  Well, for starters, the crime rate will explode in tandum with the nonwhite population. </p>
<p>2.  The diminishing white population will be targets of at least 75% of that accelerated crime rate also leading to racist maiming and murder of white inhabitants on an greatly heighened scale to what it is was prior to non-white demographic takeover.</p>
<p>3.  Your diminishing white taxes will disproportionately go into supporting them instead of the you and your immediate relatives including children where applicable, and also your extended racial family.</p>
<p>4.  If you or members of your family are struggling to find adequately paid word, you will be openly and continually discriminated against by what will invariably now be majority non-white employers.</p>
<p>5.  In relation to the education system, (if applicable in your case), your white bottom will be prevented from taking a seat in every classroom, at every level and in every sphere of education.</p>
<p>6.  Your white children, (where applicable), will be sidelined and kept out of the education system altogether since the emphasis will be to keep whites uneducated thus under the non-white jackboot.</p>
<p>7.  If you or your loved ones dare to fall ill, in the worse case scenario which will translate more and more into reality with each passing year, you&rsquo;ll have to watch them die from predominately preventable diseases.</p>
<p>8.  I could go on with regards to many other aspects of your natural human rights or more to the point, removal of them, in such areas of property ownership, for example, but I shall leave these for you to research and ponder upon yourself as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll enjoy reading all about them in your desire to experience first-hand personal abuse and slavery at the hands of non-whites as <i>punishment</i> for your forbearers&rsquo; <i>evil whitey</i> ways.</p>
<p>If doing so, ie, visualising all of the above gives you some sort of perverse buzz, go ahead and revel in it because the fact that you even have to ask &#8220;is there more&#8221;, means you&rsquo;re already brainwashed beyond redemption and you and your white Marxist devotees would be better off wiped from the white gene pool anyway.<br>

			<p> This can&rsquo;t last. I feel more optimistic than ever.<br>
Perhaps we will see a few more cities fall prey to the Third World invasion and become violent impenetrable ghettoes. But now that the genie is out of the bottle and mainstream media are starting to speak up, there can be no going back. <br>
I foresee a period where the situation will grow worse, much worse; Sharia law, idiotic demands by Muslims,race attacks and riots, murders, rapes; an increase in generally criminality from Yardie gangs and Asian drug runners, perhaps a few more Islamist bombs that hopefully will not involve loss of life. The more devastating the events, the more justification the media will have to report it in a negative, rather than an exculpatory tone. The Tory newspapers, the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail are already doing this and if it sells papers,even the Leftist press, Guardian, Mirror, Observer et al might start to murmur in agreement.<br>
 We know we are right.  Even if we didn&rsquo;t instinctively know this, our views are being confirmed by the likes of Trevor Philips and Labour lackeys who are wailing about the failure of their social engineering. This is no longer just an issue about the horrors of living alongside masses of Blacks and other alien peoples, as if that isn&rsquo;t bad enough; now it&rsquo;s about our right to survive.<br>
 Enoch Powell knew mass immigration from the Third World couldn&rsquo;t work. His detractors like to say how wrong he was because he identified the &#8216;wrong&rsquo; group of people, but he  didn&rsquo;t get it wrong. He knew that ANY group of alien people brought into a nation in the massive numbers he was witnessing was a recipe for disaster and in any case, the people he was talking about, those millions of immigrants and their descendants were the Asians (Pakistani Muslims). Also, do not  forget, that in the 1960&rsquo;s Britain, any non-white person whether Chinese, Indian, Arab etc. was referred to as &lsquo;Black&rsquo;. I can remember very clearly the day that it was announced in the news and how we all thought it was fair enough. It was the Pakistani, Indian and other communities who themselves demanded that they not be referred to as Blacks (and we all knew why!). <br>
 The BBC might think they&rsquo;re Oh so clever putting out a programme recently that demonstrates the hateful racism of Enoch Powell, but the worm has turned and there are millions of people who will be identifying with Powell, rather than their paymasters in the government who are responsible for this Marxist Social Engineering Disaster.<br>

<p>Posted by sbuffalonative at 9:16 PM on April 21 </p>
<p>&gt; I think it is money and greed over race.  They just find race neutering convenient to that end, so they use it.  I think that because there are many causes for the waves of immigrants into the Western, industrialized nations.  In other words, they don&rsquo;t really care what color or culture people will be after they are gone because they love their money and more or it - now.</p>

<p> First Hitler DID NOT WANT war with Britain or western Europe. Britain declared war on Germany in 1939. Also in 1914. What Hitler wanted was a repudiation of the hated Versailles treaty, inclusion of all German-speakers into the Reich and eastward expansion. This probably meant war with Poland and the USSR. </p>
<p> If Britain had just avoided the conflict for example, it wouldn&rsquo;t have allegedly needed all those nice, law-abiding hardworking blacks from that paradise of Jamaica to &#8220;re-build&#8221; Britain after the war. There would have been no &#8220;re-building&#8221; required since there would have been no war damage.</p>
<p>There is so much more that I simply cannot say in just one post. If you are genuinely interested I recommend the book CHURCHILL&rsquo;S DECEPTION. Also the writings of Major-General J.F.C. Fuller are brilliant. He was probably the greatest military mind the western world produced in the 20th century. I also believe Patrick Buchanan has a book coming out next month on how war between Britain and Germany could have been avoided.</p>
