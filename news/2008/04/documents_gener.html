						<p>More anti-multiculturalism fliers similar to the ones that appeared in Pittston earlier this week have been found posted on trees and utility poles in Shickshinny.</p>
<p>This comes just days after 18-year-old Nora Rynkeiwicz was arrested for vandalizing a Wilkes-Barre synagogue.</p>
<p>The black-and-white posters, which indicate white people should defend their heritage by fighting multi-culturalism, seem to be distributed by the Keystone State Skinheads, because its Web site and logo appear on the bottom of the fliers. An email seeking a response from the group was not received before deadline.</p>
<p>Borough officials and NAACP leaders are outraged at the postings. They vow to not let any hate group win.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As soon as the papers are torn down, someone or a group of people, whom the mayor calls cowards, come during the night to repost them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Shickshinny Mayor Beverly Moore] contacted the utility companies and was told they would be willing to file charges against the people posting the fliers.</p>
<p>Ron Felton, president of the Wilkes-Barre chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the postings have caused him to consider hosting an anti-hate rally to &#8220;demonstrate to these hate groups that we are not going to put up with the hate they are trying to spread.&#8221;</p>
<p>Felton commended Moore for taking a leadership stance in battling the people who are posting the documents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The posters state multiculturalism destroys the uniqueness of different groups by serving as a weakness.</p>
<p>But Felton strongly disagrees with that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are strengthened by our diversity,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p> Looks like freedom of speech won&rsquo;t have a chance in Shickshinny if the mayor and the NAACP have their way. Isn&rsquo;t it strange that, with all the fliers of a multitude of kinds that are placed on utility poles every day, without a single complaint from people, this particular poster sparks &#8220;outrage&#8221; (always the media&rsquo;s chosen word when it agrees with those whose noses are put out of joint by something) among the populace.</p>
<p> The writer could have tried to balance the story by seeing if there were any citizens out and about who agreed with the posters. But no, of course not! Why spoil a good multi-culti outrage story by revealing that not everyone agrees with your point of view? And when is the press going to start putting &#8220;hate&#8221; and &#8220;hate group&#8221; into parentheses, instead of implying that that judgment is one everyone and his dog agrees with? </p>

			<p>As a guy who bought a German propaganda poster for $400 in 1981, sold it for $800 about ten years after and found out that the going rate for the same one (Verdunkeln!) today is between $3-7000 dollars, I can attest to the power of the poster. <br>
 I just wish the guy had posted it properly, on a smooth surface and not at a skewed angle. It makes a difference in viewing. Right now I`m looking at a 67 year old poster that could be just as relevant today. It shows a dark menaceing hand reaching out to throttle Europe. I glance up at it and think Muslim, instead of Bolshevik nowadays&hellip; </p>

			<p>The posters state multiculturalism destroys the uniqueness of different groups by serving as a weakness.</p>
<p>But Felton strongly disagrees with that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are strengthened by our diversity,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Again the &#8220;Diversity is our strength&#8221; mantra is spouted without a shred of evidence to substantiate the claim.Just like the geocentrist couild not prove that the earth was the center of the solar system.The fact is their is nothing racist about the demand that anyone oppose multiculturalism.So why is the NAACP so upset.Was not the Whole idea behind the NAACP was so that blacks and whites should be treated the same and integrate as a single nation.They equate Multiculturalism with Multiracialism.So I can only conclude a persons culture is derived from a pesons race.So blacks should never be accepted as an Opera singer since Opera is not part of Black culture.Too Bad becasue black people can be great Opera singers.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s good to know that there are still young Whites sticking up for our people against multiculturalism. I commend them for their efforts. I have passed out fliers in the past, I&rsquo;m not sure if I had an affect on anyone, but it can&rsquo;t hurt spreading the message. It&rsquo;s funny to hear all of these black preachers holding anti-hate rallies when blacks hate the most.</p>

			<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s only called hate when White people want to promote being White.</p>
<p>When others promote diversity (race mixing), it is suddenly &#8220;strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>More flyers equals more publicity.  We, the readers of amren, should consider doing similar activities in our own areas of the country.</p>

			<p>As long as we allow the idea of white race survival to be equated as social nationalism (nazism) by deluded individuals or groups putting posters like this on buildings (and synagogues!) the movement will get nowhere and intelligent whites will not join in.  White people who care have to discover how to be pro-white without being anti-anyone else.  Let them have their place but let us have ours, that is all.  That is the only way it will work politically.  </p>
<p>Of course, if the world sinks into chaos, it would be a different story, but whites are badly outnumbered in a world wide slug out.  Better is to find ways to coexist with the white race given a place and the respect it deserves.</p>

			<p>This poster looked good. I didn&rsquo;t see anything &#8220;Nazi&#8221; in the poster. But understand that anyone who defends anything White, Western opposes PC, Multiculturalism, opposes any Non White group like Muslim Jihadists, that White person will be smeared as a Nazi, Hater, Fascist, RACIST etc. Get use to it. Don&rsquo;t give up and cry the first time or the next time someone calls you a &#8220;RACIST&#8221;. Learn how to handle it.<br>
On the subject of White Nationalist posters, I am the co-created of the most popular, successful White Nationalist poster since World War II.</p>
<p>Missing - a future for White Children.</p>
<p><br>
The poster features a charming little 2 year old White boy (Nordic Heritage and History Club co- founder Todd Carlsson) and the fine print presented the idea that this boy&rsquo;s future had been stolen by corrupt anti White, marxist, multi cult, global business forces. Virtually every single White Nationalist organization stole our idea and used it - that&rsquo;s fine. Go with something that hits the hard and soul and isn&rsquo;t too intellectual, and doesn&rsquo;t drone on and on about  economics that no one can understand.</p>
<p>I tip my hat to these fine young  men putting up the posters. Hope some some fine young White women shower them with hugs and kisses.</p>

			<p>Meanwhile in Zimbabwe the white farmers that built the country<br>
 enjoyed another round of land confiscations, nightime evictions and murder at the hands of Mugabe the darling of leftist multiculturalists. Go tell the white farmers about <br>

<p>The sky is blue!</p>
<p>I can say it is green with pink clouds, or that it is pink with green clouds too, but this will not change the fact that it is blue with white clouds, normally.</p>
<p>I can rant and rave that it is otherwise, but no one sane will pay attention to my comments; let alone, decide to be inspired to &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; by them, toward the sky.</p>
<p>So why is it, that an axiom of near divine manna, such as the fact that &ldquo;diversity is our strength,&rdquo; when challenged, is so weak that hysterics must ensue? Why, is a message questioning &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; seen as &ldquo;hate?&rdquo; </p>
<p>It obviously is nonsense, and no sane person can question that, so there is no need for arguing otherwise, right?</p>
<p>If diversity is our &ldquo;strength,&rdquo; than it needs to be strong enough to stand on its own in the face of &ldquo;obviously lunatic&rdquo; critiques, in other words!<br>

			<p>And how vigorously do the towns of Shickshinny and Pittston prosecute non-White vandals with spray paint?  And do they track down the people who put up posters for lost cats and yard sales?  Those people even put their phone numbers and addresses on their signs.  Any charges ought to be indefensible in court, and obvious case of selective prosecution.  </p>

			<p>The upper right picture on that flier looks like some old Nazi era photograph.  Nothing hurts the cause of protecting white people and their civilization more than fools who insist upon using Nazi images and Hitler worship.  Ask Poles and Russians how pro-white they think Hitler was.  This sort of thing plays right into Morris Dees hands.</p>

Posted by at 6:59PM</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t greatly care.  But let me respond to your question with another question:  Who, during the past century, whether succcessful or not, has put up a greater struggle and made more sacrifice for whites and for their interests and futures?  And who, under their series of misguided governments, has unwittingly fought for EVERY cause and movement to undermine white interests at home and throughout the world? That one&rsquo;s not hard to answer.</p>
<p>PS.  I agree that those kids in Penna (teenagers, apparently) are going about it in the wrong way.  But at least they&rsquo;re going about it. That&rsquo;s better than our generation and our parent&rsquo;s generation have done.</p>

 I think it is Canadian or British. Following the WW I route that the woman with the harp depicts, I think the soldier picture is fronm the same era. Canadian it might be after Vimy Ridge or British after the Somme&hellip;</p>

			<p>To WR the elder, the photo in the top right corner of the poster is not a picture of some Nazi. It is a pre-world war II, probably WWI photo of Douglas McArthur in his uniform. It is interesting how everyone jumps to the conclusion that this is a picture of some Nazi when it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Even the skinheads are smart enough to realize that putting a portrait of a Nazi soldier, or reference to the Nazi party on their flyer, would be counter productive.</p>

<p>No one is preventing &#8220;intelligent&#8221; whites from starting their own non-NS pro-white orgs or forcing them to submit to the leadership of young(and most likely poorly educated) skinheads if they choose to defend their racial interests. </p>
<p>The proliferation of openly Stalinist and even terrorist left-wing groups in the Sixties and Seventies did not halt for a moment the New Left&rsquo;s &#8220;long march through the institutions&#8221; and their eventual takeover of the universities and the commanding heights of the culture in general.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the lesson? If you don&rsquo;t like the posters organize a few like-minded friends and have the balls to go put up your own.       </p>

<p>They(KSS) are not being counter-productive. They have denounced  the attack on the Jewish Synagogue on their website. If you read through their site they do many productive things like celebrating Celtic and Nordic holidays even inviting non-memebers. I think that friends are hard to come by in the White Nationalist movement. I think KSS should be embraced as allies.</p>
<p>As far as Hatecore music goes I am not a fan of it, but there is WHite Nationalist music, like Saga, that have a Pro-White message without the vulgarity or racial slurs. </p>

 Given the statement that a response from KSS was not received before the article deadline and the number of well-planned hoax hate crimes over the years, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if this was done to discredit any attacks on the Multicult agenda.</p>

			<p>Since the KSS aren&rsquo;t even accused of vandalizing any synagogues (In fact, they expicitly condemn such acts on their website at <a href="https://www.kss88.com./main.html)," rel="nofollow">https://www.kss88.com./main.html),</a> why is this incident even mentioned in the article, unless to try and create guilt by association in the mind of the reader?</p>
<p>Really, the article contains no factual material at all.  Just repeated hysterical screams of &#8220;We don&rsquo;t like this; nobody should like this; we&rsquo;re going to do everything we can, legal and otherwise to keep anybody from hearing this message!&#8221;</p>
<p>Truly odd, isn&rsquo;t it, that this newspaper couldn&rsquo;t even find a single person who wasn&rsquo;t Outraged and Offended?  I was born in the Pennsylvania coal country, and I can testify that the overwhelming majority of the locals would agree wholeheartedly with the KSS message.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way: although the image isn&rsquo;t as clear as it might be, that military officer in the photo on the poster looks far more British to me than German.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This poster looked good. I didn&rsquo;t see anything &ldquo;Nazi&rdquo; in the poster.&#8221; </p>
<p>Posted by JR at 9:44 PM on April 7 </p>
<p>Then what is the purpose of having a German (Nazi) looking soldier included on the poster?  Isn&rsquo;t it possible to argue against multiculturalism and the like without including a military image included in the resistance to it?  That presentation very obviously prompts a Nazi comparison.  Who are you trying to kid?</p>
<p>I submit that this sort of tactic does not further the cause of white race survival because it pushes the same old buttons - the buttons that the American Nazi party are still well known for pushing in the 1960s and beyond.  Those who would save the white race should have learned something useful from this tactic&rsquo;s repeated failure over 60 years.</p>
<p>We must diverge from this if we are serious about creating a movement with any future.  Failure to create a new, intellectual and legal based argument for the right of whites to survive as a race with all its distinct cultures will result in complete failure, even in a situation where the central government has failed.</p>
<p>Here is why;  Assuming that whites could coalesce into a coherent fighting force (not as easy as it sounds) and win and hold a significant territory of the former U.S. A., internal strife would follow.  A sort of Thirty Years War would break out between religious based elements that would soon begin to fight for religious and ideological dominance.  After first turning within to purge any Jews or descendants of Jews who might have come along that far, the next would be perhaps Mormons, who by the way are already somewhat prepared as a religious practice for such a time.  Next, perhaps JWs, followed by various sects of Protestant Christians allied against Catholics and then against each other as the ranks of the most successful &#8220;true believers&#8221; were pared down.  At any point here, some outside non-white groups might re-enter the fray after gathering themselves up, seeking revenge for their first defeat.  The future of a military civil war does not look like such a bright future to me.  And that peskey dictator gene would provide factions with fanatical leaders that would not care one bit of how bashed up their own people become.  Some might even turn on their own people like Hitler did in 1945.  It looks more like the end of the human race in general or the degeneration of it to such a low denominator that little worth saving would remain.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a curve-ball for you: I&rsquo;m neither against diversity or even so-called &#8220;race-mixing&#8221;, &amp; still I appreciate the sentiment that I presume is behind the posters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m presuming that the over-riding concern here is to defend white society. I know, how then can I not be bothered by race-mixers?  Simple. As Jared Taylor says, I also believe that left to their own nature, most people will associate with people more like themselves.  The small percentage that do otherwise will not determine the fate of society.  </p>
<p>It is the calculated dispossession &amp; destruction of all that whites have built (as well as suppression of their numbers, and their enslavement through government programs that essentially force them to give the first-fruits of their labor to non-whites) that is the most nefarious force eating at our society today. </p>
<p>The claim to displace European culture is to champion diversity is simply a lie.  Those who work to do this are the ones who aim to create a homogeneous world- one without a European society in it anywhere.</p>
<p>WR is quite right, it is foolish for Americans to embrace German National Socialism, and such activity only harms the interests of white people, most of whom are neither German Nationalists nor socialists, but just do not wish to be persecuted for being white.</p>
<p>Besides, it is hardly the presence of some synagogues that threaten our way of life- it is millions of white-hating violent black criminals, millions more implacable  mexican invaders, and tens of millions of muslims who wish to wipe us out.  </p>
<p>Many of these neo-nazi skinhead groups rally to the &#8220;14 words&#8221; of David Lane, &#8220;We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.&#8221; </p>
<p>With these words,  I agree 100%.   </p>
<p>But surely it must be clear that Nazism is not the way to do that.</p>

<p>I believe the picture in the upper right hand corner is of Michael Collins. Interesting use of imagery, from what I could make out they were using old I.R.A. propoganda from the 1920s.</p>

			<p>I looked carefully at the poster.  No Nazi or National Socialist symbolism that I can see from the picture.  The picture of the woman next to the harp looks to be from around WW1 era type art to me.  The soldier in the dress cap does not look German(either Nazi or other period of military dress) to me either.  The 3rd photo on the far right isn&rsquo;t all that clear, but there looks to be a flag above a street(?).  I don&rsquo;t see anything &#8220;hateful&#8221; about the poster.  Nothing about &#8220;White Power&#8221; or &#8220;Heil Hitler&#8221; from what I could see.  <br>
The real problem is that the multicultural agenda has not only been questioned, but someone had the temerity to actually post their opinion in a public space.  The nerve!  Ron Felton should be happy as this is another example of the diversity in his community.  Of course, it isn&rsquo;t the &#8220;right&#8221; kind of diversity.  I any event, even if it was the Keystone State Skinheads who posted this, there is no threat of violence at least from the text I could read.  What the skinheads should do is rent a billboard and put up the same poster, only larger.  More diversity for Ron Felton I say!               </p>

			<p>The uniform shown on the poster is definately not German.  Looks British or possibly Russian.</p>
<p>The reason the message is coming from &#8220;skinheads&#8221; is possibly because they are the only ones willing to take up for our people.  After all, putting up anti-multicult posters is dangereous to ones reputation as a &#8220;good citizen&#8221;.</p>

<i>The upper right picture on that flier looks like some old Nazi era photograph. Nothing hurts the cause of protecting white people and their civilization more than fools who insist upon using Nazi images and Hitler worship. Ask Poles and Russians how pro-white they think Hitler was. This sort of thing plays right into Morris Dees hands.</i></p>
<p>I agree with WR the elder entirely. One thing the multicultural propagandists have worked masterfully is the psychology of guilt and appealing to the neverneverland of hope that all races will one day be equal in all ways. White Nationalists, on the other hand, have been extremely stupid as far as  the psychology of changing opinions goes. The use of any imagery that can in any way be called &#8220;Nazi&#8221; is one example. This complete lack of understanding of the psychology of persuasion is one reason their point of view has lost so much ground over the past decades.</p>

<p>You know, if the entire town took up the idea on this poster and went with it, I do believe they&rsquo;d consider dropping a nuclear bomb on the town.</p>

			<p>The man in the center photo has a round insignia on his hat, not the iron eagle grasping a swastika.  He also wears a Sam Browne belt, that&rsquo;s the diagonal strap across his chest.  Looks British to me.  Perhaps Russian, but definitely not German.</p>

			<p>I know many of the Keystone State Skinheads personally. They are wonderful, brave, deeply committed, and very smart young fellows. They are making a real difference, and a real impact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed more than a whiff of snobbery, re: the working class, Blue Collar origins of the Skinhead Movement. The KSS fellows, and the MDS group, in Maryland, are diligently and assiduously working to purge the Skins of the mindlessly violent tendencies, and correct the errors of the past. The leadership works hard to curb and redirect the wild, youthful energy of the aliented and mitigated White Youth - who know they are being slandered and swindled of their heritage, cultural inheritance, and very identity - and don&rsquo;t know what to do about it.</p>
<p>The KSS and MDS outfits are doing AMAZING work! You &#8220;Genteel Racists&#8221; ought to spend some time in discovering who they really are. And support these fine young foot soldiers, in their endeavors. These lads are keeping the promise the Founders made.</p>

			<p>For those of you attempting to identify the gentlemen in the center of the photo; if you guessed Michael Collins, you were correct. I designed this flier for distribution at the local St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parades here in PA, which is why the flier has an Irish theme to it. The thought of people confusing Michael Collins with a German solider had originally crossed my mind but when looking at it in it&rsquo;s entirety I think it becomes pretty cleat that it&rsquo;s not, especially when the target audience is predominately Irish. </p>
<p>Everything we put out takes on a similar tone &amp; appearance. We are quite aware of the publics reaction to anything NS, radical, crude or offensive and it&rsquo;s effect on the general public, which is why we go about things the way we do. Not to mention the fact that this is 2008 and we are Americans and have as much to be proud of here in our country as our distant relatives did and do in theirs. If  your not familiar with us I&rsquo;d suggest checking out our website at www.keystoneunited.com (We are working on making that our permanent domain name&hellip;) </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to the flier in question, hope it clears up a few things: <a href="/albums/ee277/Keystoneunited/DefendourHeritageGraphic.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://i229.photobucket.com/albums/ee277/Keystoneunited/DefendourHeritageGraphic.jpg</a></p>

			<p>PearlGirl at 2:53 AM is on the mark.  These fellows sound like the kind of young men who joined the Marines and Paratroopers 65 years ago, brave, patriotic, and willing to fight for their own people.  Sure, there are some thugs among them, as there were among the troops who held out at Bastogne and took Suribachi, but they are by and large our boys, and deserve our love and respect.  That&rsquo;s right, love.  If we love our culture and people, we must love our young warriors too.  How can a WN crab about these White boys, how can any civilized White object to young people who have rejected the lies of our enemies and chosen to take action in our defense?  I&rsquo;d rather teach a roomful of these rowdys than a bunch of Chinese or Blacks or Cholos, or the offspring of liberals.  </p>
