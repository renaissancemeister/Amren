						<p>Four men in Orlando were charged with a hate crime after they pummeled a 62-year-old woman and her two mentally-challenged companions at a public park after they didn&rsquo;t pay a &#8220;fee&#8221; for being white, police said.</p>
<p>Investigators said the victims were walking into a Kaley Park when they were confronted by Christopher Colbert, Erick Golden, Willie Pritts and Antoniette Boone.</p>
<p>Police said the victims were told that since they are white, they had to pay a fee to be in the park.</p>
<p>When the three didn&rsquo;t pay, the men beat them, officers said.</p>
<p>One of the victims was held up with a knife, a police report said.</p>
<p>Deputies stopped the men a few miles from the park and they were taken into custody.</p>
<p>The men face several charges in connection with the incident.<br>

			<p>Hmm, Florida is a concealed weapon state&hellip; guess the African-Americans considered that a 62-year-old woman and two mentally challenged individuals is a &#8216;fair fight&rsquo;&hellip; like when they gang up on physically smaller Asians or white women on public transit&hellip;</p>

<p>The Communists who control the government and the MSM will occasionally file hate crimes charges in cases like this and publicize it, just to make it seem like the hate crimes statutes are being equally applied, but we all know that they aren&rsquo;t. The Wichita massacre was clearly racially motivated, and no hate crime charges were filed. </p>

			<p>Of course they did it, and OF COURSE they would get caught.</p>
<p>Which makes them both hateful AND stupid.</p>
<p>This has been going on since I was a boy back in the 70&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because their enablers are hateful AND powerful.</p>

			<p>Finally we have a black on white &#8220;hate crime&#8221;; even the PC police will have a difficult time avoiding that conclusion.  I suppose that Obama would justify this as a small form of reparations.  How much are whites already paying for the privilege of having blacks in their society?  Oh, let me count the ways!</p>

			<p>I repeat, this is the outcome of the liberal/progressive program which has had the United States in its grip for some 40years now. Obama attends a racist church for twenty years and yet millions of white, men I hear more than women, support him. Does anyone understand how lost this nation is?</p>

			<p>Nobody&rsquo;s talked about the most appalling part of this article: the fact that these thugs attacked an elderly woman and two retarded men.  Aside from people who abuse children, this is one of the worst crimes, attacking the weak and helpless.  Sickening.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that they actually charged them with a hate crime, as opposed to just assault like in most of these anti-white black attacks.  I wonder if anyone has sent this article to that white woman who was beaten on the Baltimore bus for being white, then told that it wasn&rsquo;t a hate crime?  The journalist should have called her for a comment.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also surprised that &#8220;Antoniette&#8221; is a man (!) - what is it with ghetto mamas giving their kids vaguely french-ish invented names?  La-this and De-that&hellip;and then they claim them as &#8220;African&#8221; names.    Don&rsquo;t they ever feel just a little ridiculous hollering &#8220;Antoniette!&#8221; at their little boy on the playground??</p>

			<p>Communism gives Blacks the inclination to kill Whites more often<br>
then before the Civil Rights Era.<br>
Blacks see the opportunity as a green light.<br>
Before white communities ignore the indicators of racial jeopardy White communities need to talk openly about forming armed citizen communities.</p>

			<p>I agree with you pincegabacho&hellip;.they will be given awards for beating people who can&rsquo;t fight back&hellip;.blacks are pro&rsquo;s at that&hellip;and they will be at the BET awards this year plus they will probably get free college tuition &hellip;.that is&hellip;if they can read &hellip;.if they can read&hellip;.they will get the ole sheepskin and won&rsquo;t even have to attend classes&hellip;.that&rsquo;s how it works ya know!</p>

			<p>Since like just about everyone here at AR I use a pen name, I can speak freely.</p>
<p>This might seem a bit off topic, but I think it&rsquo;s related, indirectly.</p>
<p>I have two sisters; One of them takes it for granted that her children will never go to school with Blacks, ever. To secure this she enrolled her two children in a special French school. I was shocked she found it because it&rsquo;s not in a populated area. The requirement for enrollement is that the children have to learn French. Needless to say, it&rsquo;s all White. Still, even with these obvious motives, she seems slightly put out when a frank discussion of race comes on. To her credit, when Chris Rock or some other comedian comes on TV she quietly picks up the remote and shuts him off.<br>
&#8220;He&rsquo;s boring, mean, and yells too much.&#8221;  is what she says. <br>
But any more than that and she starts looking irritated, which in turn irritates me, so to keep the peace, we don&rsquo;t talk about it.<br>
The other sister, she is having problems coming to grips with her kumbaya vision of the Races.  She supported Obama early on, but started to back off before the whole Rev. Wright thing, when the Obamamania took off. It gave her the creeps. But old habits die hard and she is even more impatient about honest talk concerning Race.</p>
<p>The reason is obvious. It&rsquo;s about White and White in the Family. I know I am not the only one in this country who sometimes feels marginalized by my own family. And this has nothing at all to do with &#8220;self-pity&#8221;. My sisters are hard workers, and good people. But the fact is, we came from a working poor background. They&rsquo;re smart girls and we love each other, but the fact is, they were spared a lot of stuff their brother wasn&rsquo;t. Do I have to explain it to AR posters? <br>
They married young and with guys they met in college; both men were middle class; so with both couples working they started their lives in a whole other place then were we grew up.<br>
So, today, they can feel bad for Blacks because Blacks aren&rsquo;t in their life, and really never were. But they can&rsquo;t extend that same concern for me because it just hits too close to home. I DO have lots of experience with Blacks, most of it not so nice. I didn&rsquo;t &#8220;get out&#8221; as they say. Not until much, much later. <br>
My sisters fear and dishonesty has often challenged my limits with them. But then, they aren&rsquo;t the only ones to conceal their fear in phoney compassion. Anyway, maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, but I think different versions of this story is being played out across America.</p>

			<p>Again! Carry a weapon to defend yourself. Talk about a rightous shooting! Imagine if you are the 62 year old and a &#8220;yoot&#8221; pulls a knife on you and tells you to fork over for being white.</p>
<p>The 2nd only works if you use it. </p>

&ldquo;He&rsquo;s boring, mean, and yells too much.&rdquo; is what she says.&#8221;</p>
<p>More and more a lot of whites are willing to sympathize with white activists, and are even willing to be fingered as a &#8216;racist&rsquo;, as long as the &#8216;racism&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t TOO racist for them, or too dangerous for them. </p>

			<p>We had better accept the fact that the black and illegals problems are not something we can simply talk our way out of and a war of words is the coward&rsquo;s way of attempting to deal with issues that can only be resolved through the tragic use of violence.  If this were not true Washington would have sent debating teams to the Middle East instead of armed soldiers authorized to kill their enemies&hellip;    </p>

<p>There was a movie about Vietnam, &#8220;Full Metal Jacket&#8221;. Talking about the war, and the soldier may have been talking about more than just his experience in Vietnam, one of them says, &#8220;It&rsquo;s like they took our freedom, and gave it to the &#8216;gookers&rsquo;&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Reading this article and the following comments on this post has driven me to several emotions/thoughts. First, it was very disturbing to know that anyone would assault another human being for any reason, whether it&rsquo;s because they are white, black, hispanic, asian or etc. <br>
To comment on the thoughts of the individuals on this blog. I and many others are aware that many people in the U.S. have had &#8220;bad&#8221; experiences with people of different races, socio-ecomonic backgrounds, and yes even age, however does that give you the right to judge an entire race of people. If that is the case, the &#8220;mainstram Americans&#8221; (whites) would be the race who would be deemed as evil, manipulative, lying, and complete hipocrites. White Americans, have enjoyed the luxury of being the &#8220;preferred&#8221; race in the U.S. for generations. Let&rsquo;s examine the facts.<br>
1. It&rsquo;s was white who brought african slaves to the U.S. to serve them, as if they had been given some devine right.<br>
2. It was white political leaders who ended slavery with a law, but still demined other races the same opportunities.<br>
3. It was whites who enforced Jim Crow Laws.<br>
4. It was whites who terrorized blacks and continue to do so, but sometimes in more subtle ways, such as the unfair justice system that imprisons blacks for crimes, in which they give their white counterparts a slap on the wrist.<br>
5. It is whites who are happy as long as everything continues to be the same, especially when everything is in their favor.</p>
<p>And I could go on and on. I&rsquo;m not saying in any fashion that what these individuals did to the vistims was right. They should be punished with the fullest extent of the law! My point is that I&rsquo;m sick of anyone speaking as if black people has had it easy and should be grateful for everything whites have &#8220;done&#8221; for them. That thought is ludicrous! Come on people wake up and begin to judge a person by the content of their character!!!!! If other races judged all white people from history, they would consider them to be some of the most cruel people on the planet. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I see it! </p>

			<p>&#8220;Police said the victims were told that since they are white, they had to pay a fee to be in the park.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, this is just a more direct version of the &#8220;fee&#8221; you have to pay for being white in America, which is called taxes.</p>

			<p>Wow, and people are concerned about what Rev Wright said? Man&hellip; I dont even know where to begin. I &#8216;m a black man who grew up in a black middle/lower middle class community in the suburbs. The next town over was all white. However, both towns attended the same school. I was taught right from wrong, as well as the importance of community involvement. I sat in honor classes with people of all colors. And you know what? I&rsquo;m not the only black person to have that experience. I work hard, I love my wife, I dont have a bunch of kids. I wont name my kids &#8220;Pseudo-French&#8221; names, but they also won&rsquo;t be named Tom Or Bubba either. <br>
You guys talk about this horrible attack as if it was the result of lifting the boot off of the neck of black folks. When in reality, it is simply not having any home training,not being taught the value of life, or community for that matter. </p>
<p>You know what? It doesnt matter to me what people think of black folks. This a moment of clarity. African - Americans will fix their communities and families, or suffer a lifetime of poverty and incarceration. Some whites will cheer this on saying &#8220;look I told you so! We should have never allowed them to be free or even stay in this country!&#8221; It&rsquo;s just the way it is. At the end of the day though it would be no different if this conversations were about other races, or creeds, or faiths, or sexual orientation. </p>
<p>There will always be someone that hates you for no reason of your own. However, life is too short to let that stop you from achieving your dreams.</p>
<p>May you all find your own moment of clarity.<br>

<p> What is your explanation for all the barbaric black violence and crime that blacks have inflicted upon Canadians where there was never any slavery, segregation, Jim Crow or black presence in the country? What about Britain? France too? Just curious? What about the 800,000 blacks macheted to death by other blacks in Rwanda? I&rsquo;d like to hear from you.</p>

<p>Welcome K. Carter and thanks for posting.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself I would say that any judgement I make of anyone is based on personal experience. In the first place it would be easier to judge Blacks as a people simply because there are discernible patterns in their behavior wherever you go.  For example, Africa. It&rsquo;s a big place, lots of people, lots of different tribes, yet the same pattern applies to the entire territory (with the possible exception of Morocco and Egypt), ie; The people are always together - but NEVER united.<br>
Next, their method of conflict resolution is more violent than anywhere in the world, with the possible exception of Mexico.<br>
These patterns apply equally well with Blacks in the USA and in Canada, where there wasn&rsquo;t any slavery.  <br>
Also, whereas Blacks by and large tend to be physically strong, they are correspondingly weak intellectually and psychologically.<br>
Now, let&rsquo;s take you and I.  Myself, I am the product of an awful public school education, which, like most places in the USA leaves everything to be desired, just terrible.  I call them &#8220;Stupid Factories&#8221;, literally.  Not Factories that are stupid, but Factories that produce Stupidity.  Meaning, they are designed and built to produce and reproduce stupid people, simpletons, morons, nincompoops, and dimwits.  You get the idea.  <br>
To add insult to injury I came from an extremely poor and violent family, lots of alcohol, lots of alcoholics.  And our neighborhood was violent also. Well, neighborhoods, since we moved alot.  In fact, we moved so much from the time I was a baby that I actually learned to skip before I could walk.<br>
And yet, I learned to read and write and I used that to help me live a better life.  It might not be much for some, but it was all I had, and it was a start.<br>
You on the other hand, judging from your post, never cared about reading or writing, which are other ways of thinking.  So, your post took a lot of effort, sympathy, on my part, to get through.  And I just don&rsquo;t have anymore sympathy left for Black people.  I just do not care what happens to you anymore. Exactly because I have LOTS of experience with them. It is NOT my fault that, as Chris Rock once said, &#8220;Black people love not to know.&#8221;  If you went to the same schools I did and did not learn to read and write properly, that is the fault of a community of people who, as one of their own said, &#8220;love not to know.&#8221;<br>
You can complain and blame all you want.  But, thanks to an education that was a fair balance between Street and Books, I can see right through you (it isn&rsquo;t hard actually). Your complaining and blaming is simply a mask for learned helplessness, or, D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-C-Y. Go somewhere else for the kind of sympathy and understanding you&rsquo;re looking for. I make NO apology for refusing to play your game.<br>

No doubt black people have suffered in the past, however the same goes for all races. The Armenians, Irish, the Jews, Chinese, American Indians, etc have all suffered from genocide, oppression, poverty yet still keep fighting on and refuse to let the past blight their future. </p>

			<p>Care to guess what would happen if we have a black president whose pastor/mentor openly encourages such hatred of whites?  </p>

			<p>Blacks have a propensity for ganging up on outnumbered young and elderly.  It shows the true measure of their character and courage.  It would be deceptively simple to set traps for roving packs of blacks and move against them when they attack potentially helpless targets.  Of course, the alternative is to whimper and whine and grovel at the feet of these predators engaged in a campaign of extortion and intimidation&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;More and more a lot of whites are willing to sympathize with white activists, and are even willing to be fingered as a &lsquo;racist&rsquo;, as long as the &lsquo;racism&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t TOO racist for them, or too dangerous for them.&#8221; </p>

It is my opinion that, barring an extremely traumatic incident such as a rape or a brutal assault, people tend to go through racial awareness in stages as they mature.</p>
<p>For example, when I was young, I was your classic racial liberal.  Of course, growing up in semi-rural Minnesota, my experiences with blacks was virtually nonexistent, and the majority my my family were liberal Democrats.  Then, when I became a teenager, my political and racial views became more conservative and realistic (stage 2, perhaps?).  But since my contact with blacks was still quite limited, I wasn&rsquo;t fully aware of their temperament and demeanor.  </p>
<p>By the time I was 25, I had reached a stage in which I began to view blacks as a problem (stage 3?), as I began to interact with them in the real world.  My views had become more conservative still, yet I still clung to the belief that poverty and culture were factors in why so many blacks misbehaved.  I was a mainstream Republican by this time, but I still viewed the David Dukes of the world as extremists and racists.</p>
<p>Today, I am in my thirties, and the scales have totally fallen from my eyes.  I am now well aware of the liabilities blacks bring to a society, and no longer trust 99% of the politicians from either major party (stage 4?).  Since I first moved out to the West Coast in the late 1990&rsquo;s, I have also become cognizant of the drawbacks of Mestizos as well.</p>
<p>I am also acutely aware of how the liberal/neocon alliance wants to displace whites since the elites want a slave class.  I am also aware that the preponderance of my opinions on race and culture are no longer &#8220;mainstream.&#8221;  </p>
<p>That does not bother me one bit.  The &#8220;mainstream&#8221; is polluted.</p>
<p>Not to sound pompous, but I would rather be right than popular.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, I believe that racial awareness tends to occur incrementally, in stages, as we face real-world experiences with blacks and other non-whites.</p>
<p>In other words, do not expect the lemmings to fully awaken overnight.</p>

			<p>Some info on this blog suggests that whites are responsible for events that occurred before our time..  Gee, I am Italian and German.. My ancestors most likely were slaves for Rome and Germany at some point in history.. Who should be paying for such events.. Should i be hounding the Italian and German public for some type of reparation.. Should i move back there and become a burden for them by not working and engaging in criminal activity etc?  Should i just continue to whine and hope some fuzzy warm politically correct group takes up my cause?? Wake up America!  Most of the White people today who had ancestors who immigrated from the European nations were not here in America when the slave trade was going strong.. We were in our countries of origin. How come we have to bare the brunt of responsibility for something we had absolutely nothing to do with?? That does not make sense to me.. My ancestors did not come to America till around 1910.. So, i refuse, I repeat, I refuse to bare the responsibility of the slave event in America.. We did not profit from it because when my great grandparents came here, they brought their own clothing etc and worked in their own neighborhoods to provide for their needs.. They did not burden any government agency for handouts, they did not engage in crime, they worked! They learned English and how to fit into the new society.. </p>
<p>Two more points regarding a previous comment, as history indicates, Blacks sold blacks to slave traders headed for America&hellip;The submitter above makes it sound like whites went over to Africa and grabbed some blacks, that is not true..Africans sold their own kind to slave traders..Africans have had slaves themselves.. Various tribes have conquered other tribes and made those people their slaves.. That is a proven fact just as in the Roman times, they took slaves from whoever they conquered.. That was a way of life during those times.. I would not be surprised if my ancestors were not slaves during the Romans times and in ancient Germany.. If you were not rich, you were most likely a slaves.. So, i don&rsquo;t fall for all this whining regarding blacks here in America and slavery.. IT was a way of life since the beginning of time.. Ck out in the bible, they had slaves during that time frame also.. It was a way of life..</p>
<p>Another point, during the civil war, what about all the white men who laid down thier lifes to free the black slaves??? why is that never brought up.. Blacks never mention that fact.. They just want to keep whites down and feeling guilty..Stop falling for it.. Nowadays a person can make whatever they want out of their life..Blacks have alot of opportunties  if they would seek them out and utilize them.. </p>
<p>Lastly, America wake up..Obama is racist .. He has attended a church for 20 yrs that spews racial hatred of whites.. Plus that racist reverend called us Italians garlic nosed and that we lynched Jesus.. Is that not racist??  I abhor these types of people and i refuse to have one ounce of guilt about slavery in America.. It has been around in every nation on this earth since the beginning of time.. White people wake up, don&rsquo;t vote for Obama!</p>
