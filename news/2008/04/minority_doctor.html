						<p>A new study on physicians in California shows a glaring gap between the number of doctors of color compared with the state&rsquo;s ethnically diverse population, especially among African Americans and Latinos.</p>
<p>At the same time, the state has a disproportionate number of Asian and white doctors, according to the UCSF study, which focuses on doctor ethnicity and language fluency.</p>
<p>It found that out of nearly 62,000 practicing doctors in California, only 5 percent are Latino even though Latinos comprise a third of the state&rsquo;s total population. Only 3 percent of doctors in California are black, compared with 7 percent of the state&rsquo;s overall black population. While Latinos and African Americans make up about 40 percent of the state&rsquo;s residents, fewer than 10 percent of California&rsquo;s doctors are black or Latino.</p>
<p>The disparity is particularly alarming because minority physicians are far more likely to practice primary care medicine and work with poor or uninsured patients in rural areas, inner cities or other communities with a chronic shortage of physicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a critical public health issue,&#8221; said Dr. Kevin Grumbach, director of the UCSF Center for California Health Workforce Studies, which released the report Wednesday. {snip}</p>
<p>In a state with more than 35 million people, fewer than 3,300 Latino and only about 2,000 African American physicians are in &#8220;active patient care,&#8221; said Grumbach.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The health profession has long bemoaned the poor representation of minorities among physician ranks, a disparity wrought in part by a lamentable legacy of discrimination that included segregated educational practices. But this report is the first to analyze the physician workforce in California based on data compiled by the California Medical Board. The data was mandated by a 2001 state law requiring the board to gather information based on factors including doctor specialties, ethnicity and languages spoken.</p>
<p>The report found that whites make up 61 percent of the state&rsquo;s doctors while the white population is just under 48 percent. Asian and Pacific Islander doctors comprise 26 percent of the physician workforce while the state&rsquo;s Asian population is about 11 percent. That category includes doctors who say they are Chinese, Indian or Filipino.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet within the Asian-doctor category, there is a troubling shortage of Samoan, Cambodian and Hmong doctors, the report found, decrying the overall pool of doctors statewide as inadequate.</p>
<p>The ethnic gap is just as acute in the Bay Area, where a fifth of the general population is Latino, compared with less than 4 percent of the doctor population. The Bay Area&rsquo;s black population is just over 7 percent while the number of black doctors is just under 3 percent.</p>
<p>Besides English, Spanish is the language most commonly spoken by California&rsquo;s doctors &mdash; about 18 percent said they speak Spanish fluently.</p>
<p>Medical experts at the news conference stressed that ethnic diversity is directly tied to better access and quality of health care for disadvantaged patients.</p>

					<p>There&rsquo;s a simple way to put doctors who will do a better job in ethno-poor areas and not create affirmative action anger. </p>
<p>There should be a &#8220;community match&#8221; program at all medical schools.  Maybe 10% of spots can be reserved for students who fit the ethno-criteria of doing a better job in ethno-poor neighborhoods.  (We all know people tend to trust people who are more like them so it&rsquo;s not an unreasonable assumption that a Hispanic doctor will connect better with Hispanic patients.)  Students under this program will agree to serve 10 years in those neighborhoods.  (Throw in some debt repayment help too.)  </p>
<p>Schools will be relieved of some pressure to use preferences in selecting the main 90%.  </p>
<p>Minority advocacy groups will not be happy and most readers here will also resist, but if you are interested in pragmatic and realistic solutions to gradually reform affirmative action then something like this what you should advocate.   </p>

<p>What will motivate this new generation of whites to study, strive, and succeed? Good upbringing, as always. Is it a waste of time and effort? It seems&hellip;.Never! Competition is good for the soul. Push yourself. Know that you&rsquo;re doing your best and what you think is right. People notice even if now we just have to try even more to get even less. </p>

					<p>Without whites, most other races would do without most of the hallmarks of advanced civilization, including medicine.  Bottom line, whites provide the world with advanced technology, period.  Even among races that equal us in <span class="caps">IQ, </span>we provide this.  Currently, we have no measure for the quality of ingenuity (as opposed to intelligence) but if we did, we would find that whites have it to a far greater degree than all other races.  We&hellip;.invent.  Others can copy but few can advance civilization and none to the degree that we do.  An extremely important and mostly overlooked aspect of race.<br>

					<p>In the Black community, a lack of Black doctors should not be a problem.  After all, the Black middle class, the teachers, government workers, ect., have been avoiding Black doctors like a plague for many years, since they know that Black doctors have not been held to the same standards as White and Eastasian doctors.</p>

					<p>Here&rsquo;s a possible answer: they won&rsquo;t let you into medical school if you don&rsquo;t have a college degree. Even if you do have one, a degree in black studies, chicano studies, or education will not get you into medical school. </p>

					<p>Any field which requires above average IQ will be a field with a disproportionally low number of  both blacks and hispanics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It found that out of nearly 62,000 practicing doctors in California, only 5 percent are Latino even though Latinos comprise a third of the state&rsquo;s total population.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what percent of the one third of Latinos are here legally?  Probably less than a quarter, which changes the numbers quite a bit.</p>

<p>Good point, guy.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll get blacks in the med field here by shipping them in from Africa, where the average doctor has an <span class="caps">I.Q. </span>about the same as a construction worker here.  But since the standards are so much lower there, they do fine academically.</p>
<p>Too, don&rsquo;t underestimate AA here.  Many have already been passed who shouldn&rsquo;t be in the field.</p>
<p>A new clinic in my area advertised a new doctor recently, showing a pic of a black.  Everybody agreed they did us a great favor, because we know which med center to avoid now.</p>

					<p>If it&rsquo;s in the <span class="caps">S.F.</span> Chronicle, you can already dismiss the article as insane.</p>

&#8220;disparity&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;critical public health issue&#8221;<br><br>
&#8220;lamentable legacy of discrimination&#8221;<br><br>
&#8220;a troubling shortage&#8221;</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the answer?  Proclaim unqualified minorities to be doctors, and force minorities to go to them for treatment?  Wait - the first part is already happening.  But the second part will never happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of nearly 62,000 practicing doctors in California, only 5 percent are Latino even though Latinos comprise a third of the state&rsquo;s total population. Only 3 percent of doctors in California are black, compared with 7 percent of the state&rsquo;s overall black population.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I think whites are owed one big &#8220;THANK <span class="caps">YOU</span>&#8221; by the state&rsquo;s &#8220;people of color&#8221;, for keeping them healthy and treating them in their times of need.  <span class="caps">THAT </span>should be the real message of the article.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Medical experts at the news conference stressed that ethnic diversity is directly tied to better access and quality of health care for disadvantaged patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Disadvantaged&#8221;?!  Better quality of care?!  Those patients are actually &#8220;advantaged&#8221;, because they get to go to white and Asian doctors for care.  They will be disadvantaged when they have to go to affirmative action doctors.</p>

					<p>&#8220;whites make up 61 percent of the state&rsquo;s doctors while the white population is just under 48 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vitally important to note this in a hard-hitting news story, but it&rsquo;s not important enough to note the absence of young whites in the state. Md&rsquo;s are usually older. For all we know whites make up 61 percent of those the age of the average California <span class="caps">MD. </span></p>
<p>Also, when they use the terms, &#8216;the ethnic gap&rsquo;, &#8216;short supply in State&rsquo;, &#8216;glaring gap&rsquo;, &#8216;the disparity is particularly alarming&rsquo;, and,  &#8216;the disparity wrought in part by a lamentable legacy of discrimination that included segregated educational practices&rsquo;&hellip; I somehow don&rsquo;t think they are referring to the gap between Asian Md&rsquo;s, and white Md&rsquo;s. Something tells me they are not. I&rsquo;d call it the lamentable <span class="caps">REALITY </span>of discrimination.  </p>

I wonder if the ultimate goal of multiculturalism is indeed to transform our Western socities to that of the third world model with a nonexistent or negligible middle-class, a super-rich elite living behind gates and guards while the large mass are proles subjected to poverty, uncertainty, corruption, ignorance, gangsterism, violence, ethnic tensions etc.</p>

					<p>w.r.: I am not an advocate of multiculturalism, but it here to stay. Actually, I much prefer assimilation. I&rsquo;m not vacationing. I&rsquo;m taking care of my 86 year old father while my Mom is off in Las Vegas with her friends. I lived in these mountains (in my own place) for 16 years, so I know them well. It is true that in many ways these mountain towns are better than the Hispanic-wrecked, crime and gang-ridden Hellhole down in the Valley where I now reside. In some other ways, I don&rsquo;t like all-White towns, but they definitely are safer! All-White towns are paranoid, cold, unfriendly, and the cops have nothing to do, so they harass innocent people. On the other hand, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about getting ripped off. Diversity-land where I now reside is scarier, uglier, dirtier and stupider, but it&rsquo;s also a lot friendlier and the cops have so much to do that they won&rsquo;t even bother you for smoking a joint. I&rsquo;ve already been ripped off 4 times since I most to Greater Tijuana (petty thievery). I lived 16 yrs in White land in the hills and never got ripped even once.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mixed bag all right with good and bad on both sides. Race or ethnicity is definitely a factor, and that&rsquo;s one reason I like to come here, because we can actually talk about that stuff here. Although the hatred you all feel for most of the other races does sicken me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t insist that Blacks are the most wonderful thing on Earth,  but I don&rsquo;t really dislike them either. Just look at the statistics and you can read for yourself.</p>
<p>People can hang out anywhere they want. I&rsquo;ve lived most of my life in mostly-White places and it&rsquo;s ok there. I don&rsquo;t think that diversity is necessarily better than monoracialism, but it&rsquo;s just a reality we have to deal with these days.</p>
<p>For the record, I want all these illegals out of here and I want legal immigration down to 200,000. There&rsquo;s nothing that can be done about the Blacks and Hispanics already here. Most of the other non-Whites are no problem.</p>
<p>Immigrants are like seasoning on a dish. In many parts of California, it feels like someone dumped the shaker into the casserole. There are tons of liberal, centrist and conservative Whites here, <strong>anti-racists all</strong>, who feel just the same way I do. Try to get that one around your head.</p>

					<p>No, elderly Hmong are not likely to speak English or Mandarin, but whatever happened to a younger member of the family who can <strong>interpret</strong> accompanying grandpa or grandma to the doctor&rsquo;s office?</p>

					<p>years ago, Kaiser Permanente set up &#8220;ethnic&#8221; clinics in San Francisco for Asian &#8220;immigrants&#8221; who didn&rsquo;t want to interact with White healthcare professionals.  It was claimed that White doctors and nurses could not understand cultural practices like not undressing for physicals, not allowing men to touch alien women, etc.  And of course, there was the language barrier!  I contacted the Asian p.r. person quoted in the SF Chronicle about the plans to open more &#8220;ethnic/cultural&#8221; clinics to serve their populations.  He was very excited about these plans until I asked where I could be seen by White European Christian healthcare workers, since I felt more comfortable with them, and they understood my cultural biases and needs.  He got very quiet.  I don&rsquo;t know what happened to Kaiser&rsquo;s plan for segregated clinics, but I had no problem with it if it were handled democratically, equal access for all tribes.</p>

<p>Missing the point.  People at AR don&rsquo;t &#8220;hate&#8221; other races, they <span class="caps">FEAR </span>some individuals, and fear the aggregate cultural effect once a certain percentage threshold is crossed.  It has nothing to do with liking or disliking one&rsquo;s neighbors and colleagues.</p>
<p>And the statistics are what DO make one fearful.<br>

					<p>&#8220;w.r.: I am not an advocate of multiculturalism, but it (sic)here to stay.&#8221; Posted by Robert Lindsay at 5:02 AM on April 14</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not an advocate of it, why did you support it in your prior posts?  And, what makes you think it is here to stay, when every indication is given by the deteriorating racial situation on many fronts that we are near the brink of implosion?  </p>
<p>&#8220;It is true that in many ways these mountain towns are better than the Hispanic-wrecked, crime and gang-ridden Hellhole down in the Valley where I now reside. In some other ways, I don&rsquo;t like all-White towns, but they definitely are safer! All-White towns are paranoid, cold, unfriendly, and the cops have nothing to do, so they harass innocent people.</p>
<p>w.r.:  If people in white communities seem cold and unfriendly it could well be because they&rsquo;re not constantly high on pot and they don&rsquo;t exchange high fives as they stagger around from one place to the other.  Most white people help each other, are reliable, and they&rsquo;re concerned about maintaining an efficient community, and it depends on who is confronting them as to whether or not they&rsquo;re friendly.  Most are friendly, helpful people. </p>
<p>&#8220;On the other hand, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about getting ripped off. Diversity-land where I now reside is scarier, uglier, dirtier and stupider, but it&rsquo;s also a lot friendlier and the cops have so much to do that they won&rsquo;t even bother you for smoking a joint. I&rsquo;ve already been ripped off 4 times since I most (sic) to Greater Tijuana (petty thievery). I lived 16 yrs in White land in the hills and never got ripped even once.&#8221;</p>
<p>w.r.:  Let me sum this up:  Even though white towns are better and safer and you call the diverse utopia where you live a &#8220;hellhole,&#8221; you think living in a hellhole has its advantages because the cops are too busy with serious and numerous crimes, which makes you feel as if they&rsquo;ll be too busy to harass anyone for smoking dope.  I think that partly sums up what you wrote.  That&rsquo;s amazing.   And I find it even more amazing that you believe diverse areas have their good points because they&rsquo;re chaotic. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a mixed bag all right with good and bad on both sides. Race or ethnicity is definitely a factor, and that&rsquo;s one reason I like to come here, because we can actually talk about that stuff here. Although the hatred you all feel for most of the other races does sicken me.&#8221;</p>
<p>wr:  Race realists are not haters, as you would imply, simply for the sake of hating.  Your opinion is based in the many, many hours of Orwellian grounding you have been swamped with all your life.  Race realists view the situation in its real life perspective and understand that the volumes of hateful rhetoric coming from the black community and the numerous black on white assaults, rapes, beatings and murders, are not going to halt.  In fact they&rsquo;ll continue to increase, as they have been doing now for decades.  And because race realists have a backbone they&rsquo;re going to rail against these injustices.  Anybody that would describe that as hate is too far gone to understand.</p>
<p>Reverend Wright and the many hate spewing blacks in the country are well-known to us, and we are aware that it doesn&rsquo;t take two sides to make a war and that hatred and violence directed at one side by the other is sufficient to tell us that we will be hated and denigrated whatever we do.  Complaining against such a situation is reacting realistically to it. Those who do not are fools who have been either brainwashed into an Orwellian  love and tolerance mindset or they&rsquo;re too dense to perceive the danger.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think I could ever change your mind, Robert, and I don&rsquo;t think I want to, quite frankly.</p>

					<p>My experience as a doctor who practiced for 20 years in California is that most minority doctors don&rsquo;t care for white patients as well as those of their own race.  It varies from race to race and person to person, but if I was ever assigned somehow to a black doctor, I would rebel.  Besides hating me for my amazing privileges that I have never been able to figure out, (reverse dsicrimination in California has been applied to me since I was 19 in 1971), he is probably a graduate who benefited from reduced standards to meet racial quotas and awarded his MD for being so &#8220;amazing&#8221; for showing up in class most of the time.</p>
<p>Also, many immigrant doctors are being recruited via compensation packages that are well below that of a <span class="caps">U.S. </span>born and trained MD has come to expect.  Add to that the reduced educational requirements - many times just four years of medical school - and you have many reasons to insist that your doctor is your own race and trained and born in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span></p>

					<p>&#8220;Regarding California, isn&rsquo;t this less of an American problem, than a Mexican problem by now (or soon)?&#8221;</p>
