						<p>Controversial minister Jeremiah Wright will speak at the Detroit branch of the NAACP 53rd Annual Fight for Freedom Fund dinner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Fight for Freedom dinner, which annually attracts about 10,000 people, will be held April 27 at Cobo Hall. The gathering is a key fund-raiser for the Detroit Branch NAACP, and is billed as the largest sit-down dinner in the country.</p>

					<p>Can you imagine being a blond-haired, fair-skinned person having to work at that event in order to put food on your family&rsquo;s table?  </p>
<p>I guess it depends on whether the aforementioned person is a male or female.</p>
<p>The only thing worse might be doing the hat-check at the <span class="caps">NBA&rsquo;</span>s All-Star weekend in Vegas.</p>

					<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping he slips and starts ranting about what he really thinks.</p>
<p>That so many black organizations are glorifying this man is indicative of the widespread anti-white hate by blacks in America.</p>
<p>Most blacks believe that the more vicious hatred they spew the more they&rsquo;ll scare whitey into giving it all up, but as usual they come up short on any kind of intellectual analysis, and the result, if this continues, will be a unification of whites and white might that never could have happened if they kept their mouths shut or at least sounded civil.</p>
<p>Yes, worse IS better.</p>

					<p>Well, the <span class="caps">NAACP </span>is the black holy grail. It&rsquo;s members have created nothing less than a thinly disguised racist organization operating with preceived impunity. Wright&rsquo;s sermons of hatred are well within the dogma of the <span class="caps">NAACP </span>as it exists today. Yet a white organization (The Minuitmen) espousing the security of American borders is labeled as racist. Blacks fail to realize that The Minuitmen operate in their best interests as well. I say this because blacks are being usurped from their positions in society by the illegals. The only problem with an illegal worker is that they get mad because they are told to knock off work after 12 hours when they really want to work 18 hrs a day. </p>

					<p>This is why the <span class="caps">NAACP </span>is a racist <span class="caps">HATE </span>organization. If the <span class="caps">SPLC </span>had any credibility it would categorize it as such.</p>

.  .  . and the tape recorders will all be turned on.</p>
<p>You can only wonder how much this speech will be vetted by the Obama campaign in an effort at damage control.  My guess is that it will contain nothing interesting; just a bunch of platitudes and warm, happy statements. Similar to Obama&rsquo;s speeches.</p>

					<p>  The sad thing about Reverend Wright is that he represents all that is wrong with blacks in America. He is a bitter angry man that fosters a likewise culture. He and his liberal ilk are destroying blacks by advocating government dependency. All that talent going to waste because a small group of black liberals want to have power. It&rsquo;s so sad. The weird thing will be watching all the white liberals cringe as all this black rage gets directed at them too. <br>
  I don&rsquo;t know what the answers are to this black anger, but I do know that Jesse, Al, and Rev Wright are just plain wrong. Too bad nobody calls these folks on their bad ideas. Remember it&rsquo;s culture not race.</p>

					<p><span class="caps">CNN </span>reported that both the Clintons have also given speeches at this, &#8220;prestigious,&#8221; fund raiser dinner. The only thing different between Obama and Hillary is that the latter had an extra White parent.</p>

					<p>There is always a simmering rage in blacks. Most is just under the surface, but it&rsquo;s there. With Wright, it&rsquo;s out in the open. We all know how he feels, but what about Obama? How does he really feel? This is inborn and will never go away as long as we have Wright, Jesse and Al preaching hate and constantly playing the victim. I&rsquo;m quite sure if I came back in a hundred years, there would be Al the third, spewing the same rants.</p>

					<p>Did everyone see &#8220;Minister&#8221; Wright&rsquo;s comments a few days ago? (The ones about Hannity and Bill <span class="caps">O&rsquo;R</span>eilly?)</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t spoken publicly for a while and when he did I was shocked how crude and inarticulate his thoughts were.</p>
<p>I guess he was preoccupied since he was moving into his new home in a 93% white suburb.</p>

					<p>&#8220;he represents all that is wrong with blacks in America.&#8221;  </p>
<p>He represents all that is wrong with blacks everywhere.  The race is bitter because it is ill equipped to deal with civilization or mechanization.  In a primitive environment where strength and violence dominate, they would fit in and excel, however, that has not been the case since the advent of tools and fire.  Hence, they are anachronisms that resent being around.   </p>
