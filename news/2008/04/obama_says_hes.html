						<p>Democrat Barack Obama said Tuesday he was outraged and appalled by the latest comments from his former pastor, who asserted that criticism of his fiery sermons is an attack on the black church and the U.S. government was responsible for the creation of the AIDS virus.</p>
<p>The presidential candidate is seeking to tamp down the growing fury over Rev. Jeremiah Wright and his incendiary remarks that threaten to undermine his campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am outraged by the comments that were made and saddened by the spectacle that we saw yesterday,&#8221; Obama told reporters at a news conference.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama told reporters Tuesday that Wright&rsquo;s comments do not accurately portray the perspective of the black church.</p>
<p>&#8220;The person I saw yesterday was not the person that I met 20 years ago,&#8221; Obama said of the man who married him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What became clear to me was that he was presenting a world view that contradicts what I am and what I stand for,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Obama sought to distance himself further from Wright.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave him the benefit of the doubt in my speech in Philadelphia explaining that he&rsquo;s done enormous good.&nsbp;.&nsbp;.&nbsp;. But when he states and then amplifies such ridiculous propositions as the U.S. government somehow being involved in AIDS.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There are no excuses. They offended me. They rightly offend all Americans and they should be denounced.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama said he didn&rsquo;t vet his pastor before deciding to seek the presidency. He said he was particularly distressed that the furor has been a distraction to the purpose of a campaign.</p>

			<p>Its funny how Mr Obama is outraged about the racist Wright as soon as all of his racist rantings came out into the open, and not 20 or less years sooner.Ill say this for Wright- he did help Hillary.</p>

			<p>its seems that the reaction across the board is that Rev Wright is out of line with these comments..yet I doubt anyone here at AMREN is the least bit surprised at yet another example of a black man who cant seem to &#8216;control himself&rsquo;&hellip;</p>

			<p>White people subconsciously know who their enemies are and will never vote a black man as president. Oh they will publicly strut the PC walk and say &#8220;it&rsquo;s okay&#8221; and &#8220;I have no problem with that&#8221; but in the privacy of the voting booth they will not commit suicide. </p>

			<p>He is a skillful politician, he is in no way distanced from Wright. In fact I would wager money that Wright told him to publically distance himself so that he would stand a better chance at getting the nomination and being elected. </p>

			<p>Wow, Obama is really astute and brillant. It only took him 20 years to figure out what his pastor was saying and what he represents.  </p>
<p>Wait a minute&hellip;wasn&rsquo;t it just a couple of weeks ago he was explaining and excusing this guy as a crazy ol&rsquo; uncle?  And now he&rsquo;s throwing him under the bus?</p>
<p>Well he kept saying he was for change and here&rsquo;s a good example.  He changed his mind in a heart beat.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Democrat Barack Obama said Tuesday he was outraged and appalled by the latest comments from his former pastor, who asserted that criticism of his fiery sermons is an attack on the black church and the U.S. government was responsible for the creation of the AIDS virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mr. Taylor notes above in his 4/29/2008 AR special report:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that Mr. Obama has given his pastor a very public spanking, it will be interesting to see how Mr. Wright reacts. Will he pull in his horns and give Mr. Obama a little peace? My money says he will he come out of his corner swinging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comrade Obama, has moved form what I would call his Stalingrad moment, to his Kursk disaster. He has expended and wasted his political weapons and defenses to the point, that now he desperately gambles at further depleting them &ldquo;aggressively&rdquo; to only find himself not victorious, but more expeditiously defeated. Even should he rout Hillary the Red Queen in these remaining primaries resoundingly, with the aid of his vile multicultural partisans in the media (and I seriously doubt this now,) he will never recover enough momentum to beat Comrade No Brains McCain in the Fall general election. Yes, these white media traitors and &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; black sycophants are doing all they can to distort his problems into &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; damage, but it is not going to be enough. </p>
<p>The arrogant Prince of Mulatto Multicultural Utopian &ldquo;hope&rdquo; and &ldquo;change,&rdquo; has moved into territory that he just can&rsquo;t seem to walk through without stumbling, let alone survey and utilize to his advantage!</p>
<p>In the end, even as the liberal media swine continue to disgrace and discredit themselves for his benefit, they will also be compelled to give play to his now &ldquo;former pastor,&rdquo; the right and honorable, Comrade &ldquo;Reverend&rdquo; Wright. It is in their nature, to watch train wrecks and even encourage them; how else would they have bought the Utopian States of America &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; in the first place, if this were not the case?</p>
<p>In the end, we will be stuck with one of two white fools as President of the USA in 2008; in that, they reflect the media whores and pimps, that try to salvage the mulatto savior, that is their &ldquo;shared&rdquo; opponent now. They will never understand their compulsion for self-destruction and weepy sanctimony in its most dynamically ironic form, only that it worked to their advantage yet again!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!<br>

			<p>What is most pathetic about all this, is how many - specifically among the TV/Radio talking-head set - continue to insist that Obama himself surely doesn&rsquo;t share these ideas! Even the supposedly conservative Fox News crowd cannot defend Obama strongly enough. That race-coward Bill O&rsquo;Reily has been one of the most nauseating to listen to of them all. Anyone suppose they STILL believe Obama was oblivious to all this???    </p>

<p>When will he say the same about the remarks of his affirmative action wife who apparently was ashamed of this country until a month or two ago?  She hates America just as much as the revered pastor, but than, so does Obama and he can&rsquo;t admit that one.  Next time you see a close up of Obama, check to see if he looks like a man who has been asleep for the past 20 years.</p>

			<p>People&rsquo;s breathtaking gullibility never ceases to amaze me. Obviously Obama has a tremendous motivation to disavow this black racist lunatic Jeramiah Wright. So you really have to ask if Obama is telling the truth. So to verify whether or not he is telling the truth you must look at Obama&rsquo;s ACTIONS over the past years, not just at what he is SAYING NOW in order to be elected president of the United States. And Obama&rsquo;s ACTIONS over the past years CLEARLY proves he is now LYING: If he had a problem with Jeramiah Wright&rsquo;s oratory and central beliefs he would not have been so close to him and that black racist church. Obama&rsquo;s acting like Wright&rsquo;s black lunatic racist beliefs are a big surprise to him is LAUGHABLE: It strains credibility. Jeramiah Wright has been saying these things regularly during his &#8220;sermons&#8221; and everywhere else ROUTINELY for the past decades. And it is IMPOSSIBLE for Obama not to have been aware of this about his 20 year pastor, close friend and confidant, advisor, and spiritual guide, per Obama&rsquo;s own words. A man Obama has called a father figure! So it is easy to see (for anyone with at least a room temperature IQ) that 1.) Obama is a lunatic fringe black racist himself, and, 2.) Obama is a bald face liar and STEALTH candidate.<br>
Keep in mind also that Obama STILL belongs to that black racist church founded on genocidal &#8220;Black Liberation Theology&#8221;, a church that STILL sells, profits from, and promotes those hate-filled delusional sermons (as &#8220;best of&#8221;), and continues to vigorously defend and embrace Jeramiah Wright and everything he says (including blood libels like that whites created AIDs to kill blacks). Why does NO ONE in the media ask him why he REMAINS a proud member of such a &#8220;church&#8221;? Over and above why he has been a member for the past two decades.</p>

			<p>      Whatever his intellectual and emotional deficiencies,<br>
give Obama credit: he&rsquo;s a very poised fellow, a master of<br>
disguise. Might he not be an actor as well? How do we know that<br>
this isn&rsquo;t a staged disagreement to make Obama look clean again?<br>
I&rsquo;m not saying it will work, but they are desperate now. Any-<br>
way, it&rsquo;s a great show. Jerry has got to be Time Magazine&rsquo;s<br>
Man of the Year and our&rsquo;s as well. No one has done more to<br>
educate White America than this strutting buffoon.</p>

			<p>A simple prognostication: Take it to the bank, none of this won&rsquo;t mean squat, to the type who intend to vote, for this or any other leftist, new age democrat. Once the parasites in a society, have realized they can vote themselves a free lunch, that society is doomed.   </p>

			<p>I wonder if it has been decided that Obama will win the democratic candidacy.  Could Hillary be intentionally throwing the fight?  Could the strategy be to channel voters who were formerly undecided toward Hillary before she announces she will step down perhaps as a strategy to assist Obama? How fixed are these elections? How much aside from the lying is theatrics?</p>

			<p>Obama is not &#8216;distancing&rsquo; himself from Wright because what Wright believes is wrong and deranged. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s distancing himself because his chances for being nominated and/or elected are diminishing with each word that comes out of Wright&rsquo;s foolish mouth. </p>
<p>Many, but of course not all, black folks share Wright&rsquo;s theological and political lunacy to some degree. </p>
<p>Sadly many black folks don&rsquo;t realize how crackpot this stuff really is. </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care that Obama is wretchedly unqualified to be President. </p>
<p>All that matters is that he is black. </p>
<p>Character, competence and qualifications are all trumped by the pagan idolatry of race. </p>
<p>Republican campaign strategists couldn&rsquo;t have come up with a better way to defeat Obama than Wright&rsquo;s big mouth and overbearing, know-it-all manner.</p>
<p>If Obama is the Democratic nominee, I predict that he will lose to McCain on a scale that will make the Johnson/Goldwater or the Nixon/McGovern contests look close by comparison.  </p>

 Obama is a creature of the political elite and always has been. The core belief of these people is that the citizenry is composed of idiots. This allows them to contradict themselves and expect the public to sheepishly accept the current statement as truth. However, those willing to examine past the last sound bite, can&rsquo;t help but conclude that what drives these beltway types is overwhelming contempt for the public.<br>
 In an odd way, one could even call these people &#8220;creationists&#8221; of a sort as they believe reality started with their last lecture to the masses.</p>

			<p>Democrat Barack Obama said Tuesday he was outraged and appalled by the latest comments from his former pastor&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s &#8220;outraged&#8221; and appalled&#8221; because people are DEMANDING answers and his FREE PASS is being CANCELLED!&hellip;he&rsquo;s been caught with his pants down and has been EXPOSED for what he TRULY is, believes and stands for!</p>
<p>The presidential candidate is seeking to tamp down the growing fury over Rev. Jeremiah Wright and his incendiary remarks that threaten to undermine his campaign&hellip;</p>
<p>This is a PLAN of theirs&hellip;people are starting to &#8220;feel sorry&#8221; for Obama because of Wright and he is counting on a PITY VOTE&hellip;for people to vote for him IN SPITE of Wright!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am outraged by the comments that were made and saddened by the spectacle that we saw yesterday,&rdquo; Obama told reporters at a news conference&hellip;</p>
<p>RIGHT!&hellip;I&rsquo;m not drinking the kool-aid that Obama is serving!</p>
<p>Obama told reporters Tuesday that Wright&rsquo;s comments do not accurately portray the perspective of the black church&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not believing that either!&hellip;I think MORE of this goes on in those churches than what they would have you believe!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person I saw yesterday was not the person that I met 20 years ago,&rdquo; Obama said of the man who married him&hellip;.</p>
<p>OH YES!&hellip;Mr. OBAMA&hellip;but he IS!&hellip;and you, sir, are EXACTLY like him&hellip;CONTRARY to what you are telling us!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became clear to me was that he was presenting a world view that contradicts what I am and what I stand for,&rdquo; Obama said&hellip;</p>
<p>Unfortunately&hellip;this does NOT &#8220;contradict&#8221; anything you stand for&hellip;this has EXPOSED you for what you are..</p>
<p><br>
On Tuesday, Obama sought to distance himself further from Wright.</p>
<p>There are no excuses. They offended me. They rightly offend all Americans and they should be denounced.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>As Wright said&hellip;you are saying what you NEED to say&hellip;YOU are PANDERING to WHITE AMERICA&hellip;we do NOT buy into it!</p>
<p><br>
Obama said he didn&rsquo;t vet his pastor before deciding to seek the presidency. He said he was particularly distressed that the furor has been a distraction to the purpose of a campaign&hellip;</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t &#8220;vetted&#8221; your pastor STILL!</p>

			<p>Obama is &#8216;outraged&rsquo; now because Wright&rsquo;s racist venom finally got aired in public (the media)? Where, might one ask, was Obama&rsquo;s outrage and protests over the last 20 years or so, listening to his close friend and pastor spouting that venom against Whites.</p>
<p>Why should we now believe Obama&rsquo;s claims that those were Wright&rsquo;s, not his own thoughts. Having been silent all those years as he listened to Wright spout.</p>
<p>If a White candidate had a rabid anti-Black racist for a friend and confidante&hellip; listening to endless anti-Black venom on a weekly basis&hellip; he&rsquo;d be forced to drop out of the presidential race. By the biased media, and the Blacks uniting in protest. Well, now Blacks need to taste their own medicine.</p>
<p>Obama should take the ONLY HONORABLE COURSE left him. To resign from the race and drop out! How could he, a Black, demand no less of a White presidential candidate, yet refuse to live by those same standards Obama would demand of a White presidential candidate?</p>

			<p>This nutty pastor is also friends with Obama&rsquo;s opponent and came to bubba&rsquo;s aid during the impeachment&hellip;a picture of them both having fun in the white house can be found on the net. So this thing is not only about Obama but the democratic party being controlled by leftist ideologues. It is easier for the radicals to spew their marxist venom from the pulpit under the guise of religious freedom&hellip;the same way the Islamic mullah&rsquo;s do&hellip;.and that&rsquo;s the name of the game!</p>

			<p>I wonder if it has been decided that Obama will win the democratic candidacy. Could Hillary be intentionally throwing the fight? Could the strategy be to channel voters who were formerly undecided toward Hillary before she announces she will step down perhaps as a strategy to assist Obama? How fixed are these elections? How much aside from the lying is theatrics?</p>

<p>My thoughts exactly.  They have already decided.  Today, in the first decade of the 21st century, the Power Elite no longer has to hide.  It&rsquo;s so obvious what they are doing.  I think it&rsquo;s because they realized, &#8220;Heck, we have all the Power.  Even if they find us out, what are they going to do?  What can they do?  The hell with &#8216;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>They put Bush in office and they will put Obama there too. </p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind for you people who are despairing (and I&rsquo;m not saying you don&rsquo;t have reason. I&rsquo;m saying that if you keep doing it, you might as well be with the Enemy. And even if you are, they won&rsquo;t love you for it).</p>
<p>But one thing to keep in mind is&hellip;Though they are Powerful they are NOT invincible.  They will crumble under the weight of what they are attempting to do.  A post doesn&rsquo;t permit me to go into details, but I am absolutely convinced of it.  They are going to implode from the inside. </p>

			<p>Something stinks here.</p>
<p>I used to think that Obama&rsquo;s handlers were brilliant in their choice of strategy.  You find an educated black man who speaks like white people; you get him to make speeches in vague, nebulous terms like &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221;; and wait for his opponents to do stupid things and make policy statements that people disagree with.  All the while he sits back and lets his race card do the maximum amount of work for his campaign.</p>
<p>These revelations from Obama and Wright are so counter to what has already occurred that I fear something is amiss.  Surely Obama&rsquo;s publicity machine would have had it as their number one priority to avoid these racist black rantings from surfacing, and that his racial skeletons, especially in the form of Wright, would have been encouraged to take an extended Carribbean vacation?</p>

			<p>The Rev Wright plays the left version of Pat Robertson.</p>
<p>That is what Obama&rsquo;s apologists are leaning on - I just listened to the BBC program on the subject.</p>
<p>However, Pat Robertson has been around a while and it is well known that no responsible politician gives him an ear.  But such subtleties are impossible to point out in such an arena rife with emotional defenses.</p>

<p>&gt; As former a high school varsity forensics and public speaking competitor, I can assure you that while debate (forensics) requires intellectual acumen, public speaking is largely a kind of acting skill.  I find it amazing that someone with as little real experience as Obama can get this far solely on his extrapolating an imitation of MLK while looking like an NBA star.</p>
<p>His success is mostly due in my opinion, to how thoroughly America is confused with imagry.</p>

			<p>Since our current President is a total imbecile, I suppose that anyone who requires 20 years to decide whether he is &#8220;outraged&#8221; by hate-filled diatribes against his own country is stupid enough that he does in fact belong in either the White House or in an assisted-living home for the mentally-handicapped.  Obama may be the perfect candidate.  I hope he keeps on Condoleza as Secretary of State, since she&rsquo;s doing such a good job, and she clearly needs more money to get her teeth fixed, but failing that, Al $harpton would be a good choice.</p>
<p>This cretin&rsquo;s Supreme Court and ambassadorial appointments should be quite entertaining.</p>
<p>I suppose it is remotely possible that it *didn&rsquo;t* take the Obaminable Showman 20 years to become &#8220;outraged&#8221;, in which case he&rsquo;s a liar who thinks US voters are stupid enough to believe *anything*.  If this is the case, he&rsquo;s still a perfect Presidential candidate, because the President who preceeded our current moron was a congenital liar.</p>
<p>As John PM keeps saying, God help us all.</p>

			<p>This is mearly a badly strategised? MOCK DUAL between the &#8216;Presidential Obama, who knows he has the black vote, and Rev Right, so he can &#8216;denounce&rsquo; the Rev in Public. Im surprised it has worked so well. Either way, it seems to have backfired! Can you imagine the fun if this clown did get into the &#8216;white house&rsquo;?</p>

			<p>Did Barry not say that Jerry was characterizing himself.  Well is not characterizing an exaggeration of the truth?  So why is Barry surprised.  It&rsquo;s not Barry lying so much as he is politicking as the more truthful reverend says.</p>

			<p><i> &#8220;Barack Obama said Tuesday he was outraged and appalled by the latest comments from his former pastor&hellip;. The presidential candidate is seeking to tamp down the growing fury over Rev. Jeremiah Wright and his incendiary remarks that threaten to undermine his campaign &hellip;.He said he was particularly distressed that the furor has been a distraction to the purpose of a campaign.&#8221; </i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
Of course!  He wants desperately to be president, and he&rsquo;s so close to the White House that he can taste it.  Still,  it&rsquo;s odd that at this late date he decided to cut loose this preacher who is a millstone around his neck. He waited 20 years until now? C&rsquo;mon!   Despite his suddenly outraged denials, I don&rsquo;t believe a word of what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>I strongly suspect his advisors and funders got together and laid it on the line to him: <b>&#8220;Look!  You  want to president? Then you have GOT TO DUMP this guy who&rsquo;s dragging you down.  He&rsquo;s death to white voters. So you can either choose him or the White House. But not both.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take this opportunity to add that I further suspect that his attachment to this racist &#8220;Rev.&#8221; is mainly through and  because of his grumpy, racist wife. I think she pulls the strings in the family.  If so, that says something further about how much he is in control of his own mind   &mdash;  - or anything else. Do we want her running the White House?  All the more reason for whites not to vote for him.  </p>

Yes. And also how desperate (white) America is to prove itself virtuous, &#8220;inclusive&#8221;,  and non-racist.</p>
<p>Black America, meanwhile, laughs at white America&rsquo;s silly obsession with appearing virtuous and votes its own interests. <br>

			<p>I just heard black late-night talk radio host out of San Francisco, Ray Taliaferro, say, &#8220;It&rsquo;s almost as if America doesn&rsquo;t deserve someone as wonderful as Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder: What could we possibly have done to deserve Obama?</p>

<p>Right, and that lady at least knows who she is  &mdash;  her husband does not give the impression of knowing who he is. He&rsquo;d like to be authentically black, and his wife will certainly encourage him to achieve that by further suppressing whites so that blacks may be &#8220;equal&#8221; to them. </p>
<p>Obama may finally feel himself black enough when he has made America black enough.</p>
