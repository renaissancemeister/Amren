						<p>The Planned Parenthood Federation of America has perpetuated a &#8220;genocide on the black community,&#8221; says a group of African-American pastors who claimed Thursday the birth control and abortion provider has had a racist agenda since its beginnings in 1921.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. over 1,500 black babies are murdered inside the black woman&rsquo;s womb,&#8221; said Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, of Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny (BOND). &#8220;This is a race issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pastors urged Congress to initiate an audit of the organization and have written letters demanding that money for Planned Parenthood be eliminated from federal Title X funding, of which the group got $65 million for fiscal year 2007, according to pro-life Concerned Women of America. In total, Planned Parenthood received $300 million in government contracts and grants in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>The national office of Planned Parenthood provided FOX News with a lengthy statement on Thursday in which it said its role in the African-American community is widespread because the need is greater.</p>
<p>&#8220;The (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) revealed that a shocking number of teenage African-American girls &mdash; nearly half &mdash; carry a sexually transmitted infection,&#8221; reads the statement. &#8220;This compares to an overall average rate for all teenage girls of at least one in four.</p>
<p>&#8220;The largest increases in the teen birthrate were reported for non-Hispanic black teens, whose overall rate rose five percent in 2006. In addition, African-American women are more likely to die of breast cancer than the general population,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That is part of a troubling trend, say critics, who accuse Planned Parenthood of targeting minority neighborhoods. They blame the institution for a disproportionate rate of abortions among black women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a report released by the group of Students for Life America on Tuesday, black women are 4.8 times more likely to have an abortion than white women, while the black population in the U.S. is in decline. Black women account for 36 percent of those having abortions in the U.S. today, according to group, while black children make up 17 percent of live births.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In its response, Planned Parenthood emphasized that 97 percent of its services are focused on providing contraceptives, breast and cervical cancer screenings and sexually transmitted disease testing and treatment &mdash; not abortions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those services are more important than ever as this country faces a health care crisis &mdash; too many women can&rsquo;t afford birth control, too many families don&rsquo;t have adequate health insurance coverage and too many young people are faced with unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections,&#8221; the organization said. &#8220;As a safety-net provider, it is Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s mission to provide women, men and teens with affordable access to reproductive health care services and information, regardless of income.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Unmarried women of any race should not be getting pregnant in the first place; these black ministers have quite a &#8221; failure rate among their black congregation as far as sexual promiscuity. The black community has a very shameful record on self-control in anything pertaining to living in a given society, especially violent crime against whites and sexual crimes (rape)against whites and of course themselves.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see anyone with a gun forcing these women do (1) have sex without protection or marriage (2) Seek abortions instead of adoption or other options. There is always the good old fashioned advice of keeping your knees together until you get married. </p>

			<p>Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, was an ardent believer in racial differences, and it was her intent to reduce the numbers of non-Whites in the world.  The Black pastors are right.</p>

			<p>Sun Tzu would say that battles are often won or lost before they are even fought.  </p>
<p>How can the black race explain their out-of-wedlock pregancies amongst teenagers and adults? How can they explain the number of single-mother households? </p>
<p>The black race will continue to scratch their heads. The black race continues to wonder why other races refuse to respect them.</p>

			<p>Please! Their high out of wedlock births and abortions, is only a testament to how very promiscuous they are. Not to mention how careless the black community is about using protection. This is also why STD&rsquo;s are so outrageously high among black women.</p>

			<p>This is one issue I&rsquo;m 100% on the side of blacks with (and that says ALOT).  The &#8220;Klanned Parenthood&#8221; site has most of the relevant facts.  Here is a clip of a Planned Parenthood employee caught red handed basically admitting that their organization is involved in the extermination of blacks:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eygv8qEkiFE&amp;e" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eygv8qEkiFE&e;</a></p>
<p>Look.  Blacks in the western world, in the US specifically, don&rsquo;t have social problems so much as they ARE a social problem.  But the liberal plan to exterminate them is a completely inappropriate (not to mention, ummm, evil) way to address this.</p>
<p>Surely, we can do better.</p>

			<p>When Roe v Wade was instituted it was AIMED at WHITE women! It was part of the feminist movement to get WHITE women out of the home and out of marriages and families! To be promiscuos in other words. Bring down the family and traditional Christian beliefs and morals. They don&rsquo;t care about getting Blacks and other nonwhites into abortion mills. If they did, and wanted to get rid of Black babies, etc. then explain why they keep flooding this country with Blacks and browns and assorted nonwhites who have LARGE families???  No, abortion was a means to get WHITE women not to have WHITE babies. Along with that they promote and glamorize miscegnation to make darn sure very few WHITE babies are born! This article is another puff piece, propaganda to make us &#8220;help&#8221; these poor blacks and to take our minds off what is really happening to the White race. Sure is funny they don&rsquo;t talk about Whites only being 8% of the world&rsquo;s total population and shrinking, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			<p>Well, blame someone else for their own dysfunction. If these pastors spent more time trying to educate black women about birth control, then possibly this problem would go away. I have always felt that being a black pastor was just another scam. I mean they practically have a church on every corner and look where it has got them.</p>

			<p>Abortion has become a way not to be held responsible for your actions. Why wouldn&rsquo;t it be common among blacks? Racial temperament is the root cause of irresponsibility but it is white welfare that sustains it and allows it to flourish. This is all being done on our dime.</p>

			<p>Jesse Lee Peterson is to the right of Thomas Sowell politically.<br>
His worldview is the opposite of Jesse Jackson or Barack Obama.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea of reproductive rights has always had strong support from the eugenics crowd.</p>
<p>Think of it from their point of view: Does the world really need more nit-wits who can&rsquo;t figure out that the primary purpose of sexual intercourse is to reproduce? Or actually entertain the idea of an &#8220;accidental pregnancy&#8221; with a straight face?</p>
<p>A few days ago, you posted an article that also appears in your periodical regarding changing world demographics. As I recall, you have Africans as 25% of the world population by 2060.<br>
I&rsquo;m assuming that the Chinese aren&rsquo;t going to start embracing racial suicide any time soon, so that means most of these Africans will be living with us. Imagine Europe and North America as a giant Detroit. The only beneficiaries of this will be French Cognac makers. If any are still alive. As for me, I&rsquo;m sending a big check to Planned Parenthood. </p>

			<p>I am neither specifically for or against abortion per se. However, based solely on the astonishing irresponsibility Blacks have collectively shown regarding their own offspring, this sounds like a far more humane and indeed &#8220;moral&#8221; policy than some might wish to admit.    </p>

			<p>for 9:02. R vs W may have very well have been intended by feminists for white women but it is a very well documented fact that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was into Eugenics and was indeed for having blacks have fewer children through birth control and abortion. I have known very few white women who have had abortions but many of the black women I went to college with have had at least 1. Also if you notice, Planned Parenthood clinics are usually located in black or lower income neighborhoods, this was part of their greater plan. If the black pastors really want to help their communities they can start by teaching their little girls to respect their bodies by not starting to have sex at a very early age and teach the boys to become more responsible before having sex. Maybe this in an impossible task but that would be what would have to be done. </p>

			<p>Can anyone do basic mathematics anymore?</p>
<p>Blacks are just about one-eighth of the American population (c. 12.44%)  &mdash;   up from just about one tenth (c. 10.0%) in 1950, when the American population was just under half of what it is today  &mdash;   and they are currently producing 17% of live births, according to this otherwise-alarmist article itself.</p>
<p>In which innumerate&rsquo;s book is exceeding one&rsquo;s expected proportion of live births, vis-a-vis one&rsquo;s current proportion of the overall population, by well over one third (c. 36.7%) a sign of concern, let alone alarm, much less the hyperbolic charge here of racial genocide? The black proportion of the American population has continued to edge upward in recent decades (e.g., since Roe v. Wade [1/22/73]), despite the fact that America&rsquo;s population growth during that time frame has overwhelmingly come from immigration and the children of immigrants (especially Hispanics).</p>
<p>Whatever their abortion rate, blacks are patently out-reproducing non-Hispanic whites in this country by a margin that may be either comfortable or uncomfortable, depending upon one&rsquo;s bent.</p>

			<p>Are blacks responsible for the consequences of their own illegitimacy rate?  Sure, but Planned Parenthood and the sex revolution of the 1960&rsquo;s that they encouraged certainly haven&rsquo;t helped.  Yes, blacks have always been promiscuous, but they haven&rsquo;t always had a 70 percent illegitimacy rate, with the resultant crime that has resulted.  Blacks have always committed more than their share of crime, but they didn&rsquo;t always have shootings in their neighborhoods every night.  Something had to have happened to them 40 years ago that was decisive in their behavior to change for the worse.   <br>
Also take note that illegitimacy rates of our own race have  sadly increased over the past few decades.  Blacks are ahead of us, but we&rsquo;re moving in the same direction.  Blacks have at least as much of a grievance against Planned Parenthood as us.</p>

			<p>This whole presumption is ludicrous. The very, and only, aim of this horribly misnamed organization,is the slaughter of the unborn, strictly for PROFIT. The fact that one race is killing more of their young than another, has nothing to do with anything, other than they choose to do so.    </p>

			<p>  abortions do not disproportionally effect blacks or hispanics in relation to whites. It is all the behaviors wich are associated with having abortions that these groups choose to participate in at a higher rate than whites.</p>
<p>   Since whites choose to practice safe sex and avoid pregnancy,then it could be argued that abortion is more of a threat to white population than any other, since the white birth rate is so low even WITHOUT abortions.</p>
<p>  Large numbers of abortions in black or hispanic populations do not greatly effect thier overall high birth rates, just like higher infant mortality does not, since they have such high  birthrates anyway&hellip;despite having more abortions.</p>

			<p>Actually believe it or not but in CERTAIN African tribes birth control through abstinence is practised. However high levels of abortion among white women is a problem, here in the UK 20% of white pregnancies end in abortion, but in Russia, Australia and Canada the figure is higher! I&rsquo;am not militantly pro-life but the fact is abortion is reducing the white race, what many Family Planning groups don&rsquo;t also tell you is that an abortion can damage a woman&rsquo;s fertility so when she wants a kid she can&rsquo;t. Now you know why IVF is a booming industry in the west!  </p>

<p>Black population is in decline? What on earth can that mean? I personally am surprised by the rate of black abortions, I honestly thought they were far less likely to go the abortion route based on the number of kids they seem to have. God, just imagine how much they would breed if they did NOT have access to subsidized abortion.</p>

			<p>The bottom line is this: even with disproportionate abortions, AIDS deaths and homicide, the black race is still out-reproducing the White race by a wide margin.</p>
<p>An article on this website a few weeks back noted that by 2050, Whites will be less than 10% of the world&rsquo;s population, down from +20% in the mid 20th Century, whereas the converse is true for blacks: they will be up to +20%.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not even counting the effects of racial interbreeding.</p>
<p>If any group is losing the war on reproductive survival, it&rsquo;s us.  </p>

			<p>Did I miss the part where PP drives a bus through b@#$k neighbourhoods and entices the pregnant ones to come on down for a cost free abortion? No? If they are aborting in mass it sure doesn&rsquo;t look like it has changed the complexion of people I see every where I go!</p>
<p>After years of being told that AIDS can be avoided by wearing a condom the virus still flourishes here and in Africa, so if they choose to die from unprotected sex why do you think they would take steps to avoid a simple little thing like getting pregnant once a year? Hell! Only in America can you make a mistake (pregnancy) and get a check and other perks on a monthly basis where each kid adds to your personal wealth!</p>

			<p>If these black pastors care so much about this issue, then why don&rsquo;t they get to the root of this? Because it&rsquo;s a dirty little secret they don&rsquo;t want brought to light and that secret is this: black men rape underage girls at alarming rates. They do it almost instinctively. These girls then become pregnant with an unwanted child and become host to a sexually transmitted infection as well. When they go to the free Planned Parenthood clinic for treatment, many of them choose to abort the baby because of their sexually transmitted infection   &mdash;   they don&rsquo;t want the child to be born with it either. </p>
<p>So, tell these black pastors to get to the root of this problem (black men) and quit blaming Planned Parenthood for their stupid behaviour. </p>

<p>Wrong. That includes Hispanic women as &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>
<p>White women only have about a third of U.S. abortions. Hispanics and blacks both also have about a third each.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the birth rate among married black women is actually lower than among married (non-Hispanic) white women.</p>
<p>But regardless, the black unmarried birth rate is still so high that the good pastors need not worry about their race being in decline. Their percentage of the population has actually risen slightly while ours has slumped with Hispanics and Asians flooding in.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the coming flood of immigration from Africa, thanks to our family reunification-based immigration system, the &#8220;refugee&#8221; racket, and the diversity visa lottery. Immigration from Africa was only about 20,000 a year in the late 1980s. Now, it&rsquo;s pushing the 100,000 mark, and actually crossed it in 2006.</p>

			<p>It has to be genetic. This tendency of Blacks to whine, to blame everything and anything for their inability to live and comport themselves as real human beings. Nor are their kinfolk on the African continent or those who migrated to Europe even marginally better or more advanced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even based on Black intelligence, which while it is not politically correct to admit, tends to be substantially LOWER than Whites and Asiatic races. Call it a mindset, call it a child-like inability to think or function rationally. How else could you account for this ludicrous babble from these &#8220;Black pastors&#8221; or the never-ending antics of Blacks in general.</p>

			<p>The black population of this country is growing steadily both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the population.  The white population is shrinking steadily as a percentage of the population and soon (if not already) in absolute numbers as well.  So there is no evidence of genocide against blacks, but plenty of evidence for a program of extinction targeted at whites.</p>

			<p>History has proven that the black race cannot survive without other races. It&rsquo;s always crime, it&rsquo;s always destruction, it&rsquo;s always welfare, it&rsquo;s always blaming someone else. It&rsquo;s always something.</p>
<p>Are members of the black race capable of building a modern society? It appears that the Japanese are doing something right.</p>

			<p>The fact that blacks are having so many abortions and yet still out-produce whites shows how astonishingly irresponsible their reproductive behaviors are.  I have to agree with HH, given the way blacks raise their offspring to be thugs, murderers, and beggars, it is evident that abortion is a more humane practice. Intelligent whites who care deeply for their children simply have fewer children because they recognize the limitaions in raising too many children in today&rsquo;s world.  To blacks and hispanics, children are tools.  Tools are expendible and replaceable.</p>

			<p>&gt;Black population is in decline? What on earth can that mean?</p>
<p>The Black population isn&rsquo;t in decline, but the percentage of Blacks in the U.S. population is in decline due to the current high immigration rates.</p>
<p>Technically Whites in most Western countries are not in decline at the moment but with substandard birthrates of less than 2.1 children per female and a baby-boomer population that will soon be retiring and dying within the next 20 years the European population will drop by more than 25% over the next 20 or so years.</p>

			<p>The black race remains in perpetual failure. There are a few blacks that are an exception, but other races are never concerned about the exceptions. </p>
<p>Every time a black person does something wrong, the other races will quietly use the wrongdoing against them. Every time a black person does something wrong, the black races pushes itself back another 50 years. </p>
<p>The few exceptional blacks produce positive results, but their own race continues to reverse their positive endeavors. The pattern perpetuates itself. </p>
<p>The few exceptional blacks understand the hard truths. The remaining blacks have a predictable destiny.</p>

			<p>Planned Parenthood seems like an incompetently run organization, but no more so than Fox News.</p>
<p>The article does not contain any of these words: illegitimacy, illegitimate, legitimacy, legitimate, marriage, married, unmarried, wedlock, single.  Racial pregnancy rates are not compared or even mentioned.  In other words, it&rsquo;s a one-sided article intended to smear a leftist organization and kiss black American ***.  </p>
<p>A &#8220;fair,&#8221; &#8220;balanced&#8221; article would present the pregnancy and illegitimacy rates of at least whites and blacks, along with the abortion rates.  It would be one thing if blacks were getting married and pregnant (and on welfare) at the same rates as whites, but aborting at much higher rates, but that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening; blacks are getting married at much lower rates, getting pregnant (and on welfare) at much higher rates - consequently they&rsquo;re using the &#8220;nuclear option&#8221; of birth control at much higher rates.</p>
<p>(Note how the fact that the white population is in decline isn&rsquo;t mentioned, which leaves the impression that the black decline is exceptional)</p>
<p>Why are journalists so lazy, sloppy, and dishonest?  That&rsquo;s their <b>JOB</b>!</p>
<p>The real story (other than Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s breathtaking stupidity):  how much white-to-black wealth transfer is represented by these irresponsible blacks who neglect birth control and opt for expensive abortions, no doubt often on the white community&rsquo;s dime?  What is the eugenic effect of rampant black abortion on black IQ (it&rsquo;s likely the smarter, more responsible blacks are the ones having abortions)?</p>

			<p> The fact that illegitimacy rates are higher for blacks means they are becoming pregnant more often than whites. One would expect them to have higher abortion rates. Planned Parenthood encourages contraception, which many blacks don&rsquo;t bother to use. They wait until they are pregnant and then have an abortion. This also explains the high rate of STD&rsquo;s among blacks, where many seem to prefer unprotected sex.  As far as abortion being a white plot to limit the numbers of blacks, if true, it has been  a complete and utter failure of gigantic proportions. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;YES. Keeping one&rsquo;s knees together until marriage is a simple solution to the entire problem&hellip; though one unlikely to even be considered&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quagmyer:</p>
<p>I would say an even better solution is to NOT have children until one is financially secure enough and emotionally able to raise children, although as you posited, it is &lsquo;unlikely to even be considered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This means NOT depending on the government to take the role of the absent male by providing food, clothing, shelter and an education for one&rsquo;s children because YOU have neither the financial ability, emotional stability nor capability of raising a child  &mdash;  the most important, crucial job entrusted to parents.</p>
<p>A single young female cannot raise a boy to be a man.  I heard a gang specialist say at an educational symposium that a fatherless boy is THE definition of a gang member.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Is it Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s fault that these women can&rsquo;t seem to figure out how to use birth-control?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Michael C. Scott at 8:53 PM on April 27 </p>
<p>Michael:</p>
<p>I agree except most birth control is much too complicated for young, single, low g-loaded females to use effectively (if at all).  The only thing that would work for them is the IUD which can be inserted for up to 10 years, or the implant which also lasts for years. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of them use abortions as a form of birth control, or seem content to produce child after child, starting at a very young age (13 or 14) that they cannot feed, clothe or educate without massive government handouts.  </p>
<p>When I worked in the inner-city (in a past life) single-mother, absent father hispanic and black families of 10-14 were not uncommon, with the cycle repeated endlessly.   Remember:  They see nothing wrong with accepting government handouts  &mdash;  hell, they believe it is their birthright, including those who have illegally crossed the border.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder Whites are no longer having children?  Leave the PP organizations exactly where they belong  &mdash;  in the inner cities, if not for them then what?</p>
<p>When do the taxpayers get to shout Enough?</p>
<p>It is the government gravy train that must stop.</p>

			<p>As an attorney, I work with a lot of smart black women who are lawyers and judges.  None of them have children as they can&rsquo;t find a decent man.  No doubt some of them have had abortions.  Its the irresponsible ones having all the kids.</p>

<p>I can just imagine a junkie saying something similar in 2050 after heroin is legalized.  Or a rapist saying something similar after rape is legalized, etc., etc., ad infinitum.  It&rsquo;s a real zero of an &#8220;argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bother with the pro-abortion arguments - there are none.  The entire &#8220;pro-choice&#8221; ideology is 100% bankrupt.  I mean the  100% part literally.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one* good argument for legalized infanticide: pragmatism (i.e., women and liberals would never stop whining about it, and since liberals are the ones really using it&hellip;).  </p>
<p>*(Unless you&rsquo;re an anti-black racist - in that case this article presents the argument)</p>

			<p>I worked with a smart black lady who had been married some years earlier and had two adult sons. She planned for two and that&rsquo;s all she had. She used to fume over the idea of white men (the Supreme Court) telling her if she could have an abortion or not. Yet she was a church goer. She was a good example of the smarter reproducing less. The smartest black females I&rsquo;ve known were in their 30s-40s and beyond, and had no children, or perhaps one. </p>

			<p>To understand the true picture of abortion, one would have to <br>
look at it globally.  On an international basis, abortion is<br>
much more numerous in the whiter world than it is the non white<br>
world. Most of the countries that have the highest, per capita <br>
rates of abortion are on the European continent.  Iceland also<br>
has a very rate rate of abortion.</p>
