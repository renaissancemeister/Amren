<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The U.S. Secret Service has placed an agent on leave after an African-American employee reported finding a noose hanging at the agency&rsquo;s main training facility outside the nation&rsquo;s capital.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The noose was found by an African-American officer in the uniform division of the service during the week of April 14, according to those familiar with the alleged incident. That division protects the White House and surrounding grounds.</p>
<p>History of complaints</p>
<p>The discovery comes as U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson considers whether to sanction the Secret Service for failing to turn over evidence in a long-running discrimination lawsuit filed by agent Reginald G. Moore, an Atlanta native. Her decision is expected next month.</p>
<p>Moore and nine other plaintiffs contend that the Secret Service created a racially hostile atmosphere that tolerates discrimination and routinely discriminates against black agents seeking promotion in favor of lower-scoring white agents.</p>
<p>Nearly 60 black agents have submitted sworn statements to the court in support of the lawsuit&rsquo;s allegations.</p>
<p>Robinson has already sanctioned the service three times since the discovery process of the lawsuit began 3 1/2 years ago.</p>
<p>The African-American officer who found the noose at the training center reported the incident to his supervisor, and it was sent up the chain of command. He declined to comment for this article.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Co-workers, who said they could not speak on the record because of Secret Service rules, said the suspended employee is a white man.</p>
<p>Discrimination denied</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The agency has denied the allegations and is now appealing all of the sanctions issued by Robinson.</p>

			<p>Just more nonsense from the blacks. There is nothing they put their hand to that there isn&rsquo;t some sort of mess. It&rsquo;s always that people are against them. Never their fault.</p>
<p>Must be tough going through life, always fighting, never getting along with your co-workers. </p>
<p>Sad thing about it is that the poor guy who was suspended will probably pay the price and be fired. hope he didn&rsquo;t have too much time invested in the service.</p>

			<p>Welcome once again to the Hall of Hoaxes. A long running discrimination suite in progress, a noose &#8216;found&rsquo; by a black person who will benefit from a hate crime (notice how nobody else ever sees the noose before the offended black finds it) - echoes of the Columbia teacher&rsquo;s college.</p>

			<p>In the good old days a white man could display a hangman&rsquo;s noose in front of a black guy and be confident that the black would quiver with fright at the symbol of white power and oppression. </p>
<p>That was then, this is now.  Now when a white man displays a hangman&rsquo;s noose and a black man sees it, it is a major crime, and the white guy is the criminal.  Whites know that should a noose appear a white man will surely go to jail wrongly convicted of a hate crime.  In jail blacks will injure and may well kill the innocent white.</p>
<p>The positions are reversed.  Now when a white man sees a hangman&rsquo;s noose he is horrified and put under great stress.  Today all a black has to do to create &ldquo;a racially hostile atmosphere&rdquo; is display a hangman&rsquo;s noose.<br>

			<p>The more they do this, the more whites awaken to racial consciousness.  Once the majority are awake, blacks won&rsquo;t be welcome in the western world anymore.  Or rather, they will not be allowed to leave the communities they mostly inhabit now while those in white communities are pushed out.</p>

			<p>Try to keep an open mind, if we all work together this could be heaven for everyone. Bullies come in all colors.  We should break into groups of good and nasty instead of dividing everyone up by race.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to label people we don&rsquo;t know. Let&rsquo;s try to go out and meet people of all colors and shapes. Once we&rsquo;ve had dinner with a&hellip; say&hellip; Nigerian family, it&rsquo;ll be a lot harder to hate all Nigerians.</p>
<p>No one wants to be hated or to find a noose that&rsquo;s meant for them. Would you? Perhaps we should work together to stand up to these bullies. That is&hellip; unless you agree with their &#8220;pranks&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to play along with negative humans, It&rsquo;s much harder to to love everyone despite their differences. This may seem odd to you, but it feels GREAT! </p>

<p>&#8220;Lower scoring whites?&#8221;  LOL!  Yes, I&rsquo;ll just bet that&rsquo;s really the case, since I would venture to say there&rsquo;s not one qualified black there, having been awarded their position via affirmative action.  Sounds like they&rsquo;re making a false claim, hoping that by merely uttering that blacks are scoring higher than whites people will automatically believe that&rsquo;s the case. What blacks can&rsquo;t accomplish via their own intelligence and abilities they hope to secure through chicanery, just as they do everything else, like claiming to have built thepyramids for example.   </p>
<p>Putting blacks in charge of security is idiotic, since so many of them despise America and whites, and give their allegiance only to other blacks wherever in the world they might be.  They&rsquo;re foreign enemies most of whom think no differently than Jeremiah Wright.</p>

<p>No, this is another hoax designed to try to make these 60 black agents rich so they can retire early. It even has a name. It&rsquo;s called &#8216;The Black Lottery&rsquo;. The tickets are the sympathetic blacks and bleeding heart white liberals that sit on the jury, while the drawing is held in a Courtroom. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Lower scoring Whites&#8221;.  Many years ago, I took a civil service exam, in three parts.  Part one was a multiple choice test, on which I got 97%.  Part two was an essay, which was rated &#8220;Outstanding&#8221;, by whoever is paid to read those things.  Part three was the oral interview, for which I was rated 74% or something like that.  Parts one and two served only to establish a threshold, a minimum acceptable score.  My 97% was no better than a 70%, and Outstanding is equal to Barely Passing, in the eyes of the examiners.  Your ranking on the hiring list depended entirely on the interview.  When I got my results, I went down to ask why, and the clerk read me the comments of the interviewers.  &#8220;Hesitated before answering questions&#8221;.  Which means, I suppose, that I paused to think before speaking.  &#8220;Inadequate eye contact&#8221;, and so on.  Not one criticism of any of my answers, nothing about muddled thinking, ignorance, or excessive jive.  Our Masters have ordained that Blacks shall be equal, and the examination process shall confirm that equality.  No doubt these high-scoring Blacks excelled at eye contact and speaking without thinking, which more than balances their inability to think or speak rationally.  </p>

			<p>   They meant to say : &#8220;discriminated &#8221; for &#8221; blacks &#8221; by the Secret service by means of racist affirmative action/quotas for non-whites ; without this biased, racist barrier against whites, their numbers would certainly be much lower than 60. Merit not melanin .</p>

			<p>Good God!,<br>
           It seems like &#8216;the noose&rsquo; has somehow mutated into a kind of ju-ju fetish or a talisman of power.<br>
By reading these accounts it seems to manifest from nowhere and has the uncanny ability to both fascinate and mentally paralyse African-Americans into a state of hysteria.<br>
Reminds you of anything? - Think of the mental paralysis induced in black Africans by a skull and piles of human bones when wielded by the &#8216;ju-ju man&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Oh really, must be tough to deal with, when there are so many whites being promoted into positions that they are not qualified for everywhere and accepted into colleges despite their poor test scores.  Times are really tough for black men everywhere!</p>

<p>&gt; If it is hard to love then it isn&rsquo;t love at all, it is forced tolerance.  This man is trying to be a &#8220;Christian.&#8221;  He will turn the cheek, not because it is a natural instinct, but because he is so brainwashed that suffering for &#8220;the truth&#8221; makes him feel &#8220;great.&#8221;  Kumbiah, oh lord, kumbiah&hellip;</p>

<p>WRONG (again)! The bar is automatically lowered to floor-level for Blacks. To compensate for their innate inability to think or function rationally compared to Whites. Which lowering of the bar also accounts for those incredible bureaucratic bungles and errors we hear about, from time to time.</p>

			<p>We have reported three noose incidents inside the U.S. Coast Guard over the past year, and now we&rsquo;re working a story on a black face doll hung in effigy allegation at a Coast Guard Base in NC.  These issues need to be addressed and they need to be resolved as Hate Crimes.  Coast Guard has seen 15 senior Civil Rights Officials resign in the past 21 months since the Terri A. Dickerson took office as Director of Civil Rights.  Complaints are off the chart, and EO Reviews are conducted but never final action never signed out.  Support the men and women of the Coast Guard by asking your elected officials what they are doing to resolve these issues inside Coast Guard.</p>

			<p>Three bets:</p>
<p>1) How much you want to bet the black officer in question put the noose there himself to either get someone else in trouble or lay the groundwork for a fresh lawsuit?</p>
<p>2) How much you wanna bet that if I&rsquo;m right about that, there will be no disciplinary action taken against or bad press given to said officer?</p>
<p>3) How much you wanna bet Phil Daily&rsquo;s not too big on critical thinking?</p>

<p>Nice try, Phil Daily&hellip; but most of these &#8220;pranks&#8221; invariably turn out to be HOAXES PERPETRATED BY BLACKS. In an effort to stir up trouble and more anti-Black, anti-White hatred. For a White to hang a noose, is almost as rare as an HONEST politician.</p>
<p>Have your &#8220;dinner&#8221; with a Nigerian family. If you survive, tell us about your experience. It might be noted in passing, the VAST MAJORITY of Internet scams and frauds emanate from Nigeria.</p>
<p>Something else to think about, right, Phil Daily?</p>
