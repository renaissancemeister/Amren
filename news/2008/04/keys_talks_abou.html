						<p>There&rsquo;s another side to Alicia Keys: conspiracy theorist. The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter tells Blender magazine: &#8220;&lsquo;Gangsta rap&rsquo; was a ploy to convince black people to kill each other. &lsquo;Gangsta rap&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another of her theories: That the bicoastal feud between slain rappers Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. was fueled &#8220;by the government and the media, to stop another great black leader from existing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though she&rsquo;s known for her romantic tunes, she told Blender that she wants to write more political songs. If black leaders such as the late Black Panther Huey Newton &#8220;had the outlets our musicians have today, it&rsquo;d be global. I have to figure out a way to do it myself,&#8221; she said.</p>

			<p>Evidence of the state of black people can be surmised through the statement from Keys&rsquo; that Biggie Smalls or Tupac would have been &#8220;great black leaders.&#8221;  </p>
<p>So now not only is the government in the business of using AIDS to kill blacks, they are using music.  </p>
<p>Keys&rsquo; has a white mother and is biracial, but obviously self-identifies as black.  Just another mulatto with an axe to grind.</p>

			<p>Even if her insane statement were true, that gangsta rap is a ploy to get blacks to kill each other, what on earth does that say about the black folks who would kill someone because of rap? She is literally denigrating the intelligence of blacks by claiming this.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, if this misogynistic, violent anti-white &#8220;music&#8221; genre could be banned, folks like Keys would be shrieking even louder.</p>
<p>The US government has never needed to *trick* armed, ill-tempered people into fighting.  They were doing that before the US government existed, and they&rsquo;ll still be doing it after the US government is long gone.</p>

			<p>Well according to Alicia&rsquo;s ironclad logic, there&rsquo;s a Mexican conspiracy forcing hippies to smoke pot, and a Dutch conspiracy forcing me to drink too much Heineken. Thanks, Alica, I didn&rsquo;t realize how easy it is to jettison every shred of personal responsibility I had!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Keys, 27, said she&rsquo;s read several Black Panther autobiographies and wears a gold AK-47 pendant around her neck &#8220;to symbolize strength, power and killing &#8216;em dead,&#8221; according to an interview in the magazine&rsquo;s May issue, on newsstands Tuesday.&#8221;</p>

			<p>You need to understand how this ties in with Obama&rsquo;s Reverend Wright.</p>
<p>By &#8220;White&#8221;, Keys means &#8220;Jewish.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a growing consensus in the Black community that Jews are responsible, not only for taking profits from the Black slave-trade decades ago, but for profiting off the plight of Blacks today, with the rap-music plot and other &#8220;devilish&#8221; (to use the words of Michael Jackson, who was basically saying the same thing in code words) schemes.</p>

			<p>Psst. We must have a mole in the organization. First, Spike Lee found out that George W. Bush blew up the levees in New Orleans, then Reverend Wright found out that we invented AIDS and crack cocaine to eliminate blacks, and now Alicia Keys spills the beans about our sinister plot to hook blacks on Gangsta Rap.<br>
I hope no one finds out that we invented baggy trousers so blacks can&rsquo;t run from the cops. </p>

<p>Absolutely HILARIOUS! If she thinks that either of those two bottom-of-the-barrel thugs would be &#8220;another great black leader&#8221;, then blacks are more far gone than I ever imagined. Good lord.</p>

			<p>The logic of these people is amazing!  Is Alicia Keys trying to convince everyone that perverted lyrics in so-called &#8220;Gangsta Rap&#8221; are being secretly written by white corporate leaders at Sony?  I don&rsquo;t know about you, but my mind has a hard time grasping the image of some older white man in a suit, sitting behind his desk with pencil in hand, trying to come up with the next big gangsta hit.<br>
This is just another attempt by blacks at diverting the blame for black pathologies onto whites.  I may be giving her too much credit, but my gut feeling is that she doesn&rsquo;t believe what she&rsquo;s saying, but is simply saying what most blacks want to hear as a way to prove her blackness to them.</p>

			<p>We need news stories that points to just how absurd these people truly are.</p>
<p>Let us point out to them how they do nothing to help their own.  They love to blame whitey for absolutely everything  but do not commit their own resources to help those beaten down.  And I&rsquo;m quite sure it has not gone unnoticed how they never talk about the millions of whites who have been beaten down.  How convenient..</p>

			<p>*&ldquo;&lsquo;Gangsta rap&rsquo; was a ploy to convince black people to kill each other. &lsquo;Gangsta rap&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>Compare this with:</p>
<p>*Another of her theories: That the bicoastal feud between slain rappers Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. was fueled &ldquo;by the government and the media, to stop another great black leader from existing.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>So, the Vast White Conspiracy (VWC) created &#8220;Gangsta Rap&#8221; to &#8220;keep black people down&#8221;, yet two supposed &#8220;great black leaders&#8221; emerged from this ploy only to be &#8220;cut down&#8221; by &#8216;another&rsquo; VSW plot?</p>
<p><br>
This &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; follows the same logic as the &#8220;conspiracies&#8221; that roving bands of white lenders *force* blacks to take sub-prime loans, or roving bands of (white) CIA personnel *force* blacks to take cocaine.</p>
<p>Lastly, is it just me or do mulattoes (such as Keys and Obama) hate white people more than the &#8220;average&#8221; black American?</p>

			<p>When I first read these insane articles regarding the black propensity for persecution fantasies I think that they&rsquo;re only  validating The Bell Curve, or at least making the effort.</p>
<p>Then my knee-jerk response subsides and I understand the real reason they invent these ridiculous scenarios. It keeps them from looking at themselves.  It really is that simple. </p>
<p>And millions of them will actually believe this misguided clown.  </p>
<p>Their absence of shame and remorse as it pertains to their behavior on others is a symptom commonly attributed to alcoholics and drug addicts   &mdash;   people who are in sustained emotional arrest. And those of us who have treated that population knows how the majority of them turn out which is dead, on the street, in jail or insane. And, like addicts, blacks need the kicker of blaming someone else for their own behaviors. This is a celebration of insanity by choice.  </p>
<p>&#8220;The government is behind this&#8221;!  And a flying saucer landed in my back yard and some little green dudes stole my paycheck so now I can&rsquo;t make my house payment this month. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if most blacks stop maturing at age 15.  If sista Keys keeps it up, she&rsquo;ll qualify to be a black preacher.  &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Wright, you&rsquo;re being upstaged!</p>
<p>But blacks are comfortable with this profile.  Even &#8220;saint&#8221; Tavis Smiley said, with a big grin, on his taxpayer financed public TV program that &#8220;blacks are an emotional people&#8221;.  They also have wild and crazy imaginations, Brutha Smiley, and they&rsquo;re incapable of honest self-assessment.   </p>

<p>Egads! Yet <i>another</i> thing that blacks didn&rsquo;t invent?! Maybe she might want to revise her opinion. However, since blacks don&rsquo;t seem to need a reason to kill each other, it seems like a moot point anyway.</p>

<p> AS IF we have the kind of time to plot against these idiots. Theres no need, they cancel each other out with alarming regularity. The crime stats don&rsquo;t lie. We whites couldnt be that good to plot against every idiot who thinks hes a rapper. And if we were that good, dont you think country music would be dead by now?  </p>

			<p>NO NO The fact is that gangsta rap has been spread around by big corporations to destroy white culture and family values further than it had been destroyed. It was done so that blacks and their behaviour look cool (whatever that means) to Whites and thus whites start behaving like blacks like you know increased promiscuity, impulsive behaviour, flashy and tacky taste, increased racemixing etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Now this is no conspiracy theory but conspiracy fact.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Paranoid schizophrenia&rsquo; is actually the medical diagnosis for this condition.<br>
The terms &#8216;paranoid&rsquo; and &#8216;schizophrenic&rsquo; are all too often bandied about and abused by people who don&rsquo;t really understand the true meanings of the words - and they often used as cheap terms of abuse.<br>
In psychiatry &#8216;paranoid schizophrenia&rsquo; means that the patient holds onto obviously irrational and delusional beliefs - from the stanpoint of a &#8216;rational&rsquo; observer, and is utterly convinced of their veracity.No amount of persuasion or cajoling will divest the patient of the certainty of the delusion.</p>

			<p>The girl is truly delusional if she thinks Tupac or B.I.G would have led black America out of its current abyss.  The last time I checked, black rappers aren&rsquo;t being forced against their will to produce rap songs filled with hate, sexism and exhortations to commit violence against whites and police officers. In fact they revel in it and have become multi-millionaires with this garbage.  </p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t any use dissecting her arguments because she obviously can&rsquo;t think logically or apply deductive reasoning to a given problem.  Like most of her wretched people the best they can do is imagine that all black social pathologies are the result of a conspiracy involving white people.  Leave it to the MSM to make a star out of an air headed mulatto like Alicia Keys.  <br>

<p>A gold AK-47 necklace? Jordin Sparks should heed this anti-gangster call and drop out of the tour they have coming up together refusing to be her opening act. Good girls have to stop playing nice? </p>
<p>I could actually believe the government-drug conspiracy. If it weren&rsquo;t for the illegal drug market, interracial crimes against whites would be at levels more astounding than they already are.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;Gangsta Rap&#8221; probably was promoted by white ( Jewish) record producers. I doubt if the idea was to get blacks to kill each other, the idea was to make money. Candy bars are not sold to make people fat they are sold for profit. </p>
<p>If blacks listened to classical music then the record producers would be pushing Black Classical. You really can&rsquo;t force people to listen to a certan kind of music, you put it out there and see what sells. </p>
<p>Years ago when country music was really popular with white America the lyrics were all about prison, getting drunk and cheating on you spouse. Most people would never see music lyrics as a serious life style choice.</p>
<p>Blacks need to grow up and stop acting like children. Listening to that garbage is one thing and living it is another.  </p>

			<p>I think that her white mammy wishes that she had never had her now.Black-white racially mixed offspring always hate their white side, and love their black side, even it the black parent, usually the father, abandons the child at an early age.</p>

<p>Absolutely. It&rsquo;s truly a strange psychological phenomenon how certain light-skinned blacks seem to be the most fanatic about hating whitey.  They self-identify as the oppressed black, although they grew up raised by whites, and half or more white themselves.  So which do they really hate more?  Whites, Blacks, or themselves?  </p>

			<p>&#8220;It is a growing consensus in the Black community that Jews are responsible, not only for taking profits from the Black slave-trade decades ago, but for profiting off the plight of Blacks today, with the rap-music plot and other &ldquo;devilish&rdquo; (to use the words of Michael Jackson, who was basically saying the same thing in code words) schemes.&#8221; Garvin Alfred Schmaltz </p>
<p>     Unfortunately, I have to agree with you. This conspiracy theory is widely believed by urban blacks in both the Northeast and Midwest. Chicago is the home of Minister Louis Farrakhan and his views have certainly influenced Reverend Wright, and perhaps indirectly, Senator Barrack Obama. </p>

<p>&gt; This shows how historic revisionism works; rely on a &#8220;safe&#8221; set of bigotries and enlarge them.  Accordingly, The Dutch East India Company had no part in the slave trade, nor the British Crown, nor the Spanish Crown, nor the French, etc., etc.  And no one made any profit but a little banking family called the Rothchilds!  Not even those blacks in Africa selling their own people to the Europeans!</p>

			<p>She is just an empty-headed poser trying to generate publicity. I just listened to some clips of her on Napster. She&rsquo;s a pale (reverse pun intended) imitation of Mariah Carey. Most of these mulatto female R&B; pop vocalists these days are Mariah Carey imitators but none of them match up to the original.</p>
<p>I was watching an infomercial the other night for some CD collection black dance music from the 70&rsquo;s. It was hosted by a couple of the stars from that era. One thing that struck me was all the testemonials from supposed customers were black and they all spoke perfect standard English. The music was positive and very good. I would imagine it steams these people that all the attention goes to ghetto trash these days.</p>

			<p>I am convinced that most rappers are in fact fronts for drug and/weapon distribution networks.  Look at the amount of money they spend on bling versus declining CD sales, and look at the number of rappers who have been arrested with large amounts of drugs.  I believe that rapping merely supplements their incomes, and that drugs and guns are their main line of work.</p>

			<p>What got this whole ball of wax rolling was an article in the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> a decade ago stating (probably truthfully) that the CIA was involved in the drug trade in order to finance &#8220;black budget&#8221; activities.  Many blacks, for whom a little learning can be a dangerous thing, ran with this and started to blame the CIA for every hung toenail in the ghetto.</p>
<p>If this allegation about the CIA was true, then it doesn&rsquo;t much bother me, because a lot of the money used on the consumer end in the USA to purchase drugs originates from welfare and social insurance, so in a way, the &#8220;government&#8221; is getting its money back, and doesn&rsquo;t have to ask us for more.</p>
<p>BTW, this is the kind of reason why certain slaveowners lobbied their state governments to prohibit the education of blacks (free and slave) before the WBTS.  The reason is that a little learning can be a dangerous thing, and on the heels of the Haitian massacre, the American slaveholding class feared a similar revolt among their own.  What they feared is that, if blacks were to be &#8220;educated,&#8221; they wouldn&rsquo;t be &#8220;educated&#8221; in the quintessential sense of the word, (because they knew that, with their typically feeble intelligence, this wouldn&rsquo;t be possible) but their literacy and education would really be provided by (and agitprop for) far-left wing abolitionist/redistributionist radicals, and the blacks&rsquo; feeble mentality meant that they were easy fodder for fatuous, ignorant and paranoid interpretation of facts, bent to serve a proto-violent agenda.</p>
<p>I think the slaveholding class might have had Alicia Keys in mind.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Incoherent rantings about killing blue eyed devils set to the beat of a drum machine causes black people to kill one another? Makes sense.</p>
<p>Well, you have to be a mentally challenged Black and a school drop-out, though. Back home in Africa Blacks have been killing Blacks since the beginning of time. Most often for NO RATIONAL CAUSE. So how on earth could we expect their American counterparts to be any smarter or brighter? I mean these people are the end-product of some 50,000+ years of evolution   &mdash;   the Black people we&rsquo;re talking about. Incoherent rantings passing for music. A wired-in psychopathic leaning towards crime and violence. The genetically induced tendency for drug and/or alchohol abuse. This is how much Blacks have progressed since they first appeared on the Arican continent. Go figure!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why doesn&rsquo;t the government simply cut off the vast subsidies that make the very lives of most blacks possible in the first place&#8221;</p>

<p>The subsidies are responsible for the existence of many, many blacks, I mean their very lives. The question is not whether in some sense these subsidies cause &#8220;problems&#8221; for blacks (how many of them really feel that way?) but why, if moronic black conspiracies are true, why doesn&rsquo;t the government eliminate blacks in some simple, direct way, such as the abolition of the welfare state, instead of meddling in primitive black &#8220;music.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Great black leaders?&#8221;  Perhaps Tupac and Biggie should have considered the potential they allegedly possessed before deliberately pursuing a lifestyle that led them to their appointments with the Grim Reaper.</p>
<p>One doesn&rsquo;t hear about *white* rappers getting shot six times, or white novelists or concert pianists either.  Other than Marvin Gaye, who was killed by his father in a domestic quarrel, one doesn&rsquo;t hear about black blues or rock singers getting shot, either.</p>
<p>The thug lifestyle black rappers pursue is part of the packaging for a product that would otherwise not sell.  As an exercise for the reader, find the second album by NWA online, and listen to about the first 15 minutes.  Actually, five minutes would probably do.  They sound like they have Tourette&rsquo;s Syndrome, the neurological disorder that makes sufferers swear uncontrollably.  After you are done, please ask yourself whether you would buy that &#8220;music&#8221; on its own merits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of martial music, especially &#8220;Men of Harlech&#8221;, but that one is about Welshmen defending their homes and country from the invading Saxons, and not random street murders.  &#8220;Derwent&rsquo;s Farewell&#8221; is another of my favorites.</p>
<p>If there is one group that has not been called to account for the destruction rap has inflicted, but needs to be, it is the recording company executives who have nice homes in gated communities who are *not* shot and killed over a lifestyle choice, but who deliberately profit from a harmful product.<br>

			<p>Try to have some empathy.  Suppose your mother was white but you were stuck being black because she was so foolish as to have married your long gone black father.  Might you just wind up hating her for it?  That explains why the mulattoes are often much more anti-white than the 100% black blacks.<br>

<p>How interesting.  It seems that it&rsquo;s ALWAYS the mulattoes who are the worst, the angriest, and the most dangerous.  They should never have been created. There are all a great mistake. I&rsquo;d prefer a black person any day. I have never known a happy mulatto. Just look at Rev. Wright, Farrakhan, etc.<br>
As Howard said, it&rsquo;s another (good) reason why miscegenation should be illegal.</p>
