<p>Now a provocative new study from Northwestern University suggests that whites who are particularly worried about appearing racist seem to suffer from anxiety that instinctively may cause them to avoid interaction with blacks in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Threat of Appearing Prejudiced and Race-based Attentional Biases,&#8221; by Jennifer A. Richeson, associate professor of psychology and African-American studies and faculty fellow at the Institute for Policy Research (IPR) at Northwestern, and Sophie Trawalter, post-doctoral fellow, IPR, recently appeared in the journal Psychological Science.</p>
<p>Study participants indicated that they worry about inadvertently getting in trouble for somehow seeming biased. As a result, the study suggests, they behaved in a way that research shows people respond when faced with stimuli that cause them to feel threatened or anxious: they instinctively look at what is making them feel nervous and then ignore it.</p>
<p>In this case, study participants, 15 white college students, indicated that they were motivated to respond in non-prejudiced ways toward blacks primarily for appearance&rsquo;s sake because of concern about social disapproval &mdash; rather than because of their internal values.</p>
<p>They then took a standard psychological test that measures attention patterns related to anxiety provoking or threatening stimuli. The white students initially focused on images of black faces with neutral expressions, relative to white faces with similar expressions, and then quickly disengaged and paid greater attention to the white faces.</p>
<p>Participants who were selected for the study first had to complete a Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice Scale. Those who were selected had scores that indicated that they were externally, rather than internally, motivated to not appear racially biased. On a one-to-nine scale, they rated their agreement with statements that included: &#8220;Because of today&rsquo;s politically correct standards, I try to appear non-prejudiced toward black people.&#8221;</p>
<p>They then participated in a computer test that featured in all the trials a black face and a white face, with either similar neutral expressions or similar happy expressions. Theoretically, they shouldn&rsquo;t have paid attention to either of the two faces, one black and one white, appearing on either side of the computer screen, because they were told to keep their attention fixated on a cross in the middle of the screen. But, as expected, they inevitably turned their attention to the faces. Because everything happened so fast, however, they weren&rsquo;t aware that they had paid different amounts of attention to black faces, compared to the white faces.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it as initially turning your attention to something that poses a threat or causes anxiety and then ignoring it because you don&rsquo;t want to deal with it,&#8221; said Richeson. &#8220;These low-level psychological processes happen dynamically, and our tests indicate that people probably avoided the neutral black faces because they provoke anxiety, not necessarily because of racial animus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patterns of attentional biases were eliminated when the faces were smiling. Well-established clinical and cognitive psychology research shows that people process expressions of emotion quickly, and presumably black male faces with smiling expressions did not seem threatening or provoke anxiety.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Richeson&rsquo;s study draws from a body of such clinical psychology research on threat and attention. Basically, that research shows that people who have anxiety about various stimuli in everyday life tend to ignore what is stressing them out, unlike people with clinical anxiety, who tend to fixate on what triggers their anxiety.</p>

<p><big><b>Abstract</b></big></p>
<p>The current work tested whether external motivation to respond without prejudice toward Blacks is associated with biased patterns of selective attention that reflect a threat response to Black individuals. In a dot-probe attentional bias paradigm, White participants with low and high external motivation to respond without prejudice toward Blacks (i.e., low-EM and high-EM individuals, respectively) were presented with pairs of White and Black male faces that bore either neutral or happy facial expressions; on each trial, the faces were displayed for either 30 ms or 450 ms. The findings were consistent with those of previous research on threat and attention: High-EM participants revealed an attentional bias toward neutral Black faces presented for 30 ms, but an attentional bias away from neutral Black faces presented for 450 ms. These attentional biases were eliminated, however, when the faces displayed happy expressions. These findings suggest that high levels of external motivation to avoid prejudice result in anxious arousal in response to Black individuals, and that this response affects even basic attentional processes.<br>

			<p>This article on Amren is really interesting for a number of reasons most of them obvious.</p>
<p>But I want to report that as a coincidence, I received a spam mail today entitled &#8220;Are you Racist?&#8221;  Because of its title, I decided to have look at it.  Some group is offering a test to determine if the testee is racist.  Based on what I don&rsquo;t know, but I think it is AMAZING that this is the place our Obamaization, psycho-social programing trend has gone!!!!!</p>

Usually, those most successful in avoiding the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; are the very ones who sing their praise. Perhaps they saw some of them on a TV program.</p>

			<p>Appear racist? They do not understand..if you are white you are automatically a racist. It is bred into you. It is your fault. You are evil. Vile. Corrupt. All you have to do to prove it is to question the validity of one or more of the many accepted &#8220;black&#8221; cultural expressions or viewpoints. Then they have the right to tell you that you are what you are in any terms they choose. Cracker. White boy. Honkey. Casper. Devil.</p>
<p>If you are black and you do not agree with me it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a white thing, and you would&rsquo;nt understand. </p>

			<p>Right about the fear of being called racist. Everything we say or do can be called racist, and we are automatically judged guilty.</p>
<p>However, the &#8220;study&#8221; is stupid. It is unscientific and highly biased. It assumes that a White is disturbed by a Black face. <br>
This is a classic example of a &#8220;scientist&#8221; rigging the experiment so that it comes out the way he wants. Sometimes this is unintentional, but this time, it&rsquo;s obviously not.</p>
<p>This is something that you find behind and under a horse.</p>

			<p>This study CONFIRMS exactly what many of us have been saying, that many if not most &#8220;White-Guilt Ridden LIBERALS&#8221; have NO EXPERIENCE with BLACKS OR BROWNS. They have NO idea what they are talking about. If you don&rsquo;t have any experience with something, then you are most assuredly NOT an EXPERT on it, this means RACE, for those of the White, guilt ridden persuasion. </p>

			<p>I think if more whites adopted white nationalism they would have less of a chance of being percieved as racist.As an example if a white person contantly complained about certain people who are late coming to work or call in sick more than most other people and they all happen to be black than you might be percieved as being a RACIST.As a white nationalist it is something I expect so have no reason to comment a about it.I am also just as quick to praise blacks who are punctual and never call in sick and are hard working without sounding like I think its an exception.I hesar racist comments from  non-racially aware whites all the time and the blacks know about it and act accordingly.You will find that some blacks really have respect for white nationalist.</p>

			<p>1. Emotionally healthy, self-respecting Whites avoid Blacks, for obvious reasons.<br>
2. An emotionally disturbed society condemns them for their rational behavior.<br>
3. Emotionally healthy, self-respecting Whites now have one more good reason to avoid Blacks, namely the fear that their normal, healthy attitude might be revealed to the emotionally disturbed society, thus earning them the censure of that society.  <br>
     The consequence of this research will be cameras in every workplace to count how many milliseconds you spend looking at different people, and arresting you for insufficient eye contact.</p>

<p>They never get tired of diagnosing disorders in whites.  </p>
<p>The truth is, you really don&rsquo;t need a federal grant to study this.  Whites are tired of getting blamed for causing black behavioral problems.  Avoidance is a very simple modus vivendi.  </p>
<p>The government and activists, however, are making that solution increasingly difficult.</p>

			<p>I am so happy that more and more and more whites are yelling, not just whispering, but yelling at both the racist africans, the Busheviks (Republicans), and Bolsheviks (liberal white Democrats) about black on white racism.  The yelling is hitting mainstream radio and TV.  Thank God.  These racist africans have killed, raped, looted, and racially cleansed tens of thousands of us since MLK marched on DC.  And the only reason, I say the only reason, they got away with it is because the Busheviks and Bolsheviks turned their back on their killing, raping, looting, and racially cleansing.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a white guy attracted to black women, who grew up around blacks back when we were all too young to have any prejudices.</p>
<p>By high school I&rsquo;d figured out that it was an awful lot of hassle to be with the women I was most attracted to. By the time I was in the army, I found it was more trouble than it was worth.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I&rsquo;m utterly convinced that 99% of black/white racism comes from blacks and is directed against whites. And though I&rsquo;m about as far opposite a classic &#8220;racist&#8221; as it&rsquo;s possible to be, I&rsquo;ve learned that avoiding blacks generally means avoiding a headache or worse.</p>

			<p>Fear of being thought a racist? Not sure about YOU, good friends, but I could care less what ANY Black thinks of me. I do not want one as a friend, I go out of my way to have as little to do with them as possible   &mdash;   which includes those at work.</p>
<p>Call it a firm belief in &#8220;freedom of association.&#8221; That I have the right to chose whom I wish to befriend or help. Nor would I ever ask anything off any Black. </p>
<p>As to &#8220;Trusting&#8221; one&hellip;  I&rsquo;d rather trust a poisonous snake not to bite me. Being far too aware of what their mentality is really like.</p>

			<p>Knowing that an unfounded accusation of racism could cost me my job, or lead to an extremely unpleasant scene that I can&rsquo;t possibly come out of looking good, or lead to any number of other unpleasant consequences, certainly makes me anxious when dealing with black people. A teenager in my family told me she feels &#8220;racist&#8221; because she resents being harassed by black males on the street and at work. Trying to suppress perfectly natural thoughts and feelings like that could easily lead to anxiety, too.</p>

			<p>Lol&hellip;..yeah, that&rsquo;s the reason whites avoid blacks&hellip;.not the crime, violence and drama.  Maybe that&rsquo;s an issue for the small number of liberals who are overly burdened with white guilt (or rather the lie they tell themselves to avoid admitting the truth).  But the rest of us avoid them because we know that, at best, they are toxic.  Interactions with them are UNPLEASANT due to bad behavior on their part.  But also, a large part of the time, they are dangerous.  That&rsquo;s why most whites go to such great lengths to live away from blacks.  Hell, there has been MASS MIGRATION of whites over the last ten years because of this issue.  Often, those that don&rsquo;t do this, learn it&rsquo;s a huge mistake.</p>

			<p>Every white person should know by now that there is no way to win the racism game.  This is when one is called a racist, then the accused racist goes to extreme lengths to show that he is indeed not racist, while the accuser silently laughs.  The Republican party is forever falling into this unwinnable game.  If and when John McCain wins the election this fall, inevitably you will hear the strained voices of the left screaming for the Republicans to &#8220;reach out&#8221; and &#8220;heal&#8221; the country.  Then they will go overboard to appease the radical left through the continuance of racist quota programs, more welfare etc&hellip;.</p>

			<p>Academia gets it backwards once again. Whites avoid blacks for sheerly practical reasons. If you are in a store (try Home Depot) and need help the black person will be absolutely clueless. He/she may have worked there 5 years but will know nothing about the store layout. If you call a Govt office and want help - the black voice on the other end of the line will not know who works there, how the organization works, where things can be found. (They know their rights, benefits and quitting time and thats it). Forget racism..whites avoid blacks because there is simply no practical reason to talk to them.</p>

			<p>Whites need to break their psychological chains and be openly confrontational with any racism directed against whites, whether from black racists or white leftists.<br>
And stop worrying whether someone calls you racist or not. The term has now lost all meaning. Be FREE instead to speak the truth to the hate-whitey racists who have all the racial power!<br>
Just look at the display of blacks DEFENDING the REAL racist remarks of Obama&rsquo;s Black Totalitarian &#8220;spiritual advisor&#8221;. You don&rsquo;t see ANY hesitation on the part of blacks to say the most brazenly hateful and racist things against whites.<br>
So why should whites have any hesitation to mouth-off back, and WITH JUSTIFICATION?</p>

			<p>Now a provocative new study from Northwestern University suggests that whites who are particularly worried about appearing racist seem to suffer from anxiety that instinctively may cause them to avoid interaction with blacks in the first place.<br>
&ldquo;The Threat of Appearing Prejudiced and Race-based Attentional Biases,&rdquo; by Jennifer A. Richeson, associate professor of psychology and African-American studies and faculty fellow at the Institute for Policy Research (IPR) at Northwestern, and Sophie Trawalter, post-doctoral fellow, IPR, recently appeared in the journal Psychological Science.</p>
<p>One needs to see exactly where this &ldquo;study&rdquo; comes from; the hallowed halls of Northwestern University, which has a campus in Chicago, the very home of  Sen. Barack Obama<br>
and his holy church.  <br>
This turkey Jennifer A. Richeson report from the &ldquo;African-American studies department is nothing but a smoke screen for the Black fascist pogrom of accusing the white race of what they in reality practice. </p>
<p>As a Caucasian I could less about what a group of Black half-wits from an idiot Black Fascist University regard as racist. These parasites claim that whites avoid blacks because they wish not to appear racist. <br>
No, its because we have nothing in common, after witnessing the Mien Kempf minister from Chicago, Barrack&rsquo;s spiritual mentor this mindless fool, Jennifer A. Richeson has the gall to come out with this propaganda as a smoke screen for the vile black trash &ldquo;study&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The truth is that the white race has no real men; two movements responsible for this fact, are the Marxist feminists and the mind control by the media via movies, television and magazines. <br>

<p>Or testing you at DMV when you update your driver&rsquo;s license and putting the results on your license as a reference to law enforcement to see if you&rsquo;re capable of hate crimes.  </p>
<p>White police candidates already get tested for racist tendencies during the racialist-oriented situational questions.  This is nothing new.  They think they can judge your character with a simple test or interview.  What gets me is the level of intelligence of the test givers in most cases.  They really believe this stuff.</p>

			<p>I think this is an outstanding study, and very informative. Perhaps some of you are missing the point. Does it not substantiate a lot of the things we&rsquo;ve been saying on these message boards for awhile now?</p>
<p>Like many of these subjects mentioned in the article, I do everything in my power to avoid professional contact with blacks for fear of my job. I learned very early on that minorities in my company are to be treated with kid gloves, treated preferentially. </p>
<p>My job would be in jeopardy if a minority finds something I do or say offensive. I avoid them at all costs.</p>

Just look at the elaborate dwellings they live in, in the few places there is no contact, with other civilizations. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;Our research suggests that we now also need to start thinking about creating opportunities to undermine anxieties about living up to those standards, to let people know they are going to be okay if they engage in interracial relationships.&rdquo; (last sentence in the original of the first article)</p>
<p>Yeah, &#8220;they are going to be okay,&#8221; like the 30,000 to 40,000 white women raped yearly by blacks (compared to virtually zero black women raped by whites).</p>

<p>A friend of mine here in Berkeley recently told me of a white neighbor of his that asked a black woman to please not park blocking his driveway. The white neighbor went back inside, and soon there were several police at her door  &mdash;  the black woman had called the police and claimed the white woman had pulled a knife on her!</p>
<p>I have taken the advice of several posters here who warn repeatedly to just avoid all blacks whenever possible. It&rsquo;s made my life considerably more pleasant.</p>
<p>&#8220;creating opportunities to undermine anxieties&#8221;?</p>
<p>How about ending all the laws, policies that mandate integration and so prevent the races&rsquo; natural separation.</p>

     Didn&rsquo;t give them much of a show-just startled physically.<br>

			<p>I had an incident related to this study that should be the basis for additional scientific research.  I was in Argentina in the fall of 2007 for about 6-7 hours and wanted to see some of Buenos Aires.  A black cab driver waived to me, so I jumped in his cab.  For those who do not know, Argentina is a very white country - hardly any blacks at all.  So, I figured I&rsquo;d give this guy the benefit of a doubt since I was in a foreign culture (in all fairness to Argentinians - who I really enjoy as a nationality -  this guy was from Uruguay).  I later learned that during the 45 minutes I was with this cabbie, he passed a counterfeit 50 peso note to me (about $17 US).  Now what are the odds that I would find one of the few black cabbies in Argentina who would pull a crime on me?  Should have listened to that little inner voice when I first saw the cab driver&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, Jennifer A. Richeson isn&rsquo;t white. However, the other woman involved in this &#8220;study&#8221; (Sophie Trawalter, PhD) seems to be. It would appear that the college-induced anti-white brainwashing is still working its magic on Ms. Trawalter.</p>
<p>A first-semester psychology student knows that when a behavior receives negative reinforcement it is extinguished. Most adult whites know from real life experience that contact with blacks will probably result in more hassles (and serious problems) than contact with whites, and they avoid it. So why is it necessary to test for the obvious??</p>

			<p>Geez, looking at a another White face could just as easily be attributed to &#8220;narcissism&#8221;.  And not necessarily the bad kind.  It could have to do with self-image, in the psychological sense, which is pretty fundamental; and of course, entirely in keeping with Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s notion of Race as an extended family. Something a Left/Liberal/Neocon would disagree with verbally, and agree with non-verbally.  Proving only that it is true that language does not always control behavior. Still, it&rsquo;s also true you can do a lot with language.  In fact, in High School, I was so confident of language&rsquo;s flexibility, and my Gym teachers stupidity, that for Health class I gave a written and oral presentation, in front of the class, on how it was possible to get VD from a meteorite. The secret of course is in keeping a straight face.</p>
<p>But never mind. We&rsquo;re always so serious here, and not just here.  And certainly for a good reason.  But, let&rsquo;s have some fun for once.</p>
<p>Ask any Psychologist what they can tell you about words like - Causality, Meaning, Rhetoric, Logic, Mind, Intention, Stimulus, Response, Conditioning and, one of their favorites, Reinforcement. There are claims that the matter on these words has been settled. But there are no reasons to take such claims seriously. In fact, with so many different schools of Psychology available, how could that be so?  And the same goes for Philosophy. Neither of these two has anything definitive to say about the word &#8220;cause&#8221;, not by any stringent intellectual standard that is.  But, they still go right on using the word.<br>
It can be amusing to let such people go on about this or that and let them warm to their theme and then when they wind down, presumably to catch their breath so they can continue later, let &#8216;em have it with a question or two about &#8220;causality&#8221; or &#8220;meaning&#8221;, ya know, with something like&hellip;.&#8221;What does the word &#8220;meaning&#8221; MEAN?&#8221;  Or, &#8220;Is it REALLY possible to locate a single stimulus from an entire stimulus field? And if so, how do you KNOW?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this a number of times.  It&rsquo;s great fun.  Though clearly not for them.  But so what? Anyway, the secret is in keeping a straight face.<br>

			<p><b>The most racist people on earth are non-whites, ESPECIALLY blacks. Why? Because they KNOW they can get away with ANYTHING, because their spineless, guilt-ridden (for no reason), self-loathing, leftist white masters ALLOW them to get away with it.</b></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget   &mdash;   this is the &#8216;school&rsquo; (term used loosely), where Bernadine Dohrn teaches. She and her charming hubby, one Bill Ayers (himself a &#8216;professor&rsquo; at the Univ. of Illinois), were leaders of the Weathermen in the late &rsquo;60s/early &rsquo;70s. But then again, ALL colleges are like this.</p>
<p>One humorous note   &mdash;   they &#8216;tested&rsquo; (aka &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to do this over and over and over again until we get the results we want&#8221;) a whopping <b>15</b> students/prisoners.</p>
<p>So Jenny and Sophie, if you&rsquo;re reading this, how about next time you do two things:<br>
1.) Test a few <b>thousand</b> white people and please pick me.<br>
2.) Now, test a few <b>thousand</b> <b>black</b> people&hellip;</p>
<p>[I warn you though   &mdash;   if you publish the REAL results of #2, you WILL be fired immediately. Ask Watson and the thousands of other leftoids who have been thrown under the bus by your marxist rulers. Besides, you wouldn&rsquo;t have the guts to do the above anyway.

			<p>What exactly does it mean to be racist? If a negative bias one holds towards blacks in general can be supported by evidence of poor black behavior like low high school graduation rates, high illegitimacy rates, high incidence of violence and stealing and so forth, is one a racist or is one just being rational? I don&rsquo;t believe in unconditional love for family members so why should I show it towards a race that causes so many problems compared to whites? <br>
The problem blacks have is that the bias they suffer from is justified. Granted, we should still as human beings try to embrace individualism but that doesn&rsquo;t me we have to ignore the facts about race to do so.</p>

			<p>Seems that the young black Richeson decided to make a career in dissecting a white psyche. This is not her first big discovery. It was already reported in the media about her study, where whites, that were in contact with blacks had, after that encounter, slower reaction times (or something like that), anyway, their deciding abilities were substantially decreased for some time, probably due to the effort to avoid any interracial problem during the encounter. </p>
<p><i>Richeson and her colleagues have found that in addition to being a source of stress, interracial interaction can also undermine cognitive performance. They are currently investigating the underlying mechanisms of this negative effect on cognition, particularly on self-control, which involves inhibiting one&rsquo;s behaviors, thoughts and urges, to combat, for example, prejudicial thoughts.</i></p>
<p>Of course, her answer isn&rsquo;t to end the forced interactions, but to overcome the hindering prejudices - then we will be all sooo happy. And getting black superiors is a wonderful cure to this:</p>
<p><i> For example, she finds that whites who have positive interactions with blacks in superior, high-status roles (i.e., a white assistant working for a black executive) were less biased. </i></p>

			<p>Avoiding trouble is the key. Any black can accuse any White of anything and the White will be automatically found to be guilty. If a black accuses a White of racism, the White is never given a chance to defend himself. The White is always guilty.<br>
It&rsquo;s better if we avoid contact, that way we are not falsely accused.</p>

			<p>A great many christians say that this country was founded on judeo-christian beliefs. Wrong. A great many people say this country was founded on equality among it&rsquo;s people. Wrong. The FACT is this country was founded on two principles. One is equal economic opportunity ( the pursuit of happiness ) and freedom of association. The Jamestown colony was founded to explore economic opportunities. The Plymouth colony was founded for religious freedom ( the colonists rejected the church of England and being forced to associate with it, freedom of association ). I do not own a business or employ the minimum number of persons or greater to be covered under anti-dicrimination laws. I do not provide public services that are covered under the same laws. I am an American that is free to exercise my right of freedom of association. I do not interact with blacks by choice, not out of &#8220;racism&#8221; or any other contrived label. I live in an area of the country that has a high concentration of blacks and have years of experience with their behavior and &#8220;culture&#8221; I don&rsquo;t like them, I don&rsquo;t associate with them, and I am not a racist. There are lots of things that I don&rsquo;t like, and I don&rsquo;t dislike them because of their color or appearance. It&rsquo;s the nature of the thing.</p>

			<p>My wife and I work in education in California. There are a lot of blacks. We have trained ourselves to be very careful about what we say around them. They are always tuned in to anything that might appear racial. However, I have had a much bigger problem with white people playing the status game of who is the superior white person. <br>
These people distort everything one might say and run right back and tell every black co-worker. Blacks are not the big problem cowardly whites are.</p>

<p>As usual, here&rsquo;s another study that offers only a partial bit of information.  It&rsquo;s as if these elites are living in another world.</p>
<p>Most whites I find are like myself.  We don&rsquo;t really like being around blacks because they&rsquo;re just not bright enough to understand even the simplest of ideas or jokes.  Their humor is confined to laughing at others and their actions, not anything abstract others might think or believe or any thoughts or situations with nuances, because both are beyond black understanding, as are many things.</p>
<p>Too, most blacks are apt to want to engage in conversations on the most elementary level, they&rsquo;re loud, brash, abrasive, and they take offense too easily, plus there&rsquo;s not a lot they understand.</p>
<p>But the biggest grabber is that most whites in the company of blacks get an eerie feeling they&rsquo;re in the company of aliens who are so different from themselves they just don&rsquo;t feel conmfortable.</p>
<p>And, the bottom line?  No amount of affirmative action that&rsquo;s passed into law, nor any other draconian laws, will alter these very importantant facts.</p>
<p>The only answer to the black/white problem is separation any way possible.</p>

			<p>Those least exposed to blacks and illegal aliens are the biggest advocates of these two groups. I have for a long time thought that the best way to end illegal immigration and affirmative action is to locate as many members of these two groups as possible in places like Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard and Harvard Square. If the liberal elites are so crazy about illegal immigrants and affirmative action they should have to live with the results of their delusional theories and policies. At present they are able to inflict their insane policies on the rest of us and are not forced to live with or be exposed to the results of those policies.</p>
<p>I think we should have signs at the border urging all of the illegals to go to Massachusetts and Vermont.</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;the black woman had called the police and claimed the white woman had pulled a knife on her!&#8221;</i></p>
<p>A similar incident happened to friend on my street.</p>
<p>Blacks moved into the house next door and they carried on as you would expect of stereotypes. They had the habit of playing midnight basketball on school nights when my friends and their kids were trying to sleep.</p>
<p>My friend confronted them on it and after it was over, the police showed up at his house saying the neighbors called that he had threatened them with a gun.</p>
<p>Blacks are trouble any way you look at it. Any interaction has the potential of turning into a racial confrontation. The best measure to take is to avoid blacks. No contact. No trouble.</p>
<p>BTW: My friends kept a record of their neighbors activities and presented the evidence to housing court. They were evicted by court order.</p>
<p>If blacks move in and they start causing trouble, keep a written and photographic record of their activities. If you do, it&rsquo;s likely they&rsquo;ll cut their own throats.<br>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s long (general) experience with low black behavior, their primitively selfish mentality, and their proudly ignorant contempt for any civilized social instinct - all of which causes most whites to avoid blacks.</p>
<p>Collectively, blacks were socially evolving in the right direction within the traditional American working family culture throughout the forties and fifties - and then came the welfare state, which derailed the traditional path, made marriage, legitimate birth, and two parent families economically &#8216;foolish&rsquo; compared to welfare money that could be had from the government through single-mother multiple illegitimate births. </p>
<p>The streets of American cities filled with black kids without parental control, without parental example to teach them work values, or even right from wrong.                               </p>
<p>What five decades of these idiotic federal government policies yielded has been obvious to the rest of the public for several decades now. Urban slums continuing to fill up with lost, ignorant, angrily selfish and hate-filled self-destructing criminals.    <br>

Any little thing could be perceived as some slight or perhaps even racist!  The funny thing is they&rsquo;d act one way when they were with you one on one but then when it was a whole bunch of them and just you, the only white person, they totally acted differently, many times demeaning you because you&rsquo;re white.  That was my experience.  It was very hurtful.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I think blacks are extremely intelligent, they have existed for as long as any other race, and already they have produced this fellow Carver, who did some things with peanuts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks so very much as this explains the black guy who once lived in this area and had large caricatures of Mr. Peanut emblazoned on the doors of his Camaro, this heretofore being a mystery to me.  </p>

			<p>Wait till Obamamerica is where you live. You wont have much choice of avoiding blacks racial psychosis. Your job, your livelihood, even the right to make sense will be in jeopardy. The slightest ideological mistep will have you dragged before Racial Sensitivity Courts. At first the penalty will be humiliating Sensitivity Awareness Classes, repeat offenders will be barred from holding any kind of Government related job or contract. Then when you lash out you will be tagged with a <br>
&#8220;violent offender&#8221; rap and and after comes IRS confiscations and jail. Think I am exaggerating? Listen to Rev. Wrights vision of a future &#8220;Just America&#8221; and remember Obama sat there nodding in agreement for 20 years.<br>

			<p>If you want a good example of guilt ridden White people just look at the states of Vermont and Maine. Beautiful states both!<br>
Most of the inhabitants of these states have never had anything to do with blacks or latinos.<br>
I have spent a fair amount of time in Maine and you wouldn&rsquo;t believe the heated discussions that I have had with Maine locals.<br>
I was always able to shut people up by saying that they never associate with with minorities and that is why they aren&rsquo;t even aware of their dissemblence. They have absolutely no contact.<br>
The same can be said of virtually all of the librals that I know.<br>
The circles that they run include only White elite libs.<br>
This is quite maddening<br>

But Obama continues to defend the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Wright who has pratically called for the elimination of Whites and gave an award to Farrakhan who, through his mouthpiece the late Kahlid Muhammad, has actually has called for the elimination of Whites.</p>

			<p>Whites really need to get over this &#8220;I&rsquo;m guilty of being a racist complex&#8221;. To begin with I have never talked with any white person that has ever owned a slave nor do I know of anybody anywhere that has ever owned a slave. Likewise I have never talked with a black or any associates of blacks that have ever been slaves. Thus, to associate me or other whites with being slave owners just because of the color of my skin is simply discriminatory and racist in the truest sense of the word. <br>
    Bowing down to these black whiners that are in fact the worse racist pigs that ever walked the face of the earth does not help matters, it just makes it all worse. Saying sorry to a group of thugs for doing absolutely nothing wrong is simply stupid.  Once they know they can pull a scam on you because you are white and can get away with it THERE WILL BE NO END TO IT!  <br>
    To all reading my post BE PROUD OF BEING WHITE! and stand by it to the death, and if that makes us all racist TOO DAM BAD! Let the war begin and may the best race win!          </p>

<p>Naturally, &#8220;getting messed up&#8221; can take lots of forms: verbal abuse and name-calling, disciplinary actions and compulsory &#8220;apologies&#8221;, job loss,  lawsuits and fines, being a victim of simple assault, or of assault with a deadly weapon, and being called various racial epithets in the process  &mdash;  quite a list!

			<p>The charge of &#8220;racist&#8221; today, is comparable to the charge of &#8220;communist&#8221; in the 50&rsquo;s-60&rsquo;s. Most whites today would prefer to be called anything else (with the possible exception of &#8220;child molester&#8221;). There have been situations where I have been asked if I&rsquo;m a racist; perhaps by someone I was debating, or when I was commenting on a current event, wherein I calmly struck a thoughtful pose, and replied &#8220;Yes, I believe I may be&#8221;. This response surprises the questioner so much, they normally are speechless. I have learned to not fear the charge of &#8220;racist&#8221;, because most who make the charge do not know the true meaning of the word. In almost ALL cases, the charge is made by someone unable to refute facts and reasoned thought. </p>

<p>Ah, what a relief to say  it. I AM A RACIST. </p>
<p>I avoid blacks. All blacks. I want nothing to do with them. Nothing. As a white racist I am doing all blacks a favor. I cause them harm. My existence hurts them. My life damages theirs. My white skin causes them terrible pain. My whiteness is the cause of all their problems. </p>
<p>The best thing I can do for Blacks is to avoid them, stay away from them, not talk to them, not live near/with them, not work with or around them and to leave them alone. I accept the fact that I am a racist and I can do nothing but cause severe harm to any black I approach.</p>
<p>As a white, thus as a racists, the best thing I am doing for ALL BLACKS is to stay away from them. So I do.</p>
<p>Thank you. You&rsquo;re welcome. I now ask all whites (all racists) to stop terrorizing blacks and to join me in avoiding blacks at all times. We owe them at least that.</p>

			<p>Yes, true.  Unfortunately, the country is inviting black Africans from at least six different African nations. I guess this is to &#8220;diversify&#8221; the country.

<p>Exactly right.  </p>
<p>I love the Argentine people, and I mean that.<br>
But I wouldn&rsquo;t take anything an Argentinian said very seriously, especially about the USA. Though some Argentinians are very, very, sweet and decent people, and not a few are well disposed towards the States, the majority are chaotic, confused, and corrupt. In fact, most will nod their head in agreement. Just a few years ago they have 5 Presidents in TWO WEEKS! What does THAT tell ya?  They are, even by their own admission, immature, selfish and dishonest. The poor things have NEVER learned to cooperate with each other, ever.<br>
One of them once said to me, &#8220;You think you are better than us.&#8221;  And I said clearly, but without any anger, and without skipping a beat, &#8220;Of course I&rsquo;m better than you.  Do you think it&rsquo;s difficult to be better than YOU?  All you have to do is TRY and you are automatically better.  You guys don&rsquo;t try.  Hell, you don&rsquo;t even CARE.  And yet, you want to be EQUAL to everyone else. Just silly.  And what has it gotten you?  In one year (2001) you defaulted on the largest National debt in the History of the World and went through 5 Presidents in Two weeks.&#8221;<br>
So, if I was a Black man, I would take cold comfort, or none at all, in hearing an Argentinian call me their equal. In fact, Blacks in the States have done far more as a people than the Argentinians have in their entire History.  And why?  Because they are AMERICAN!  Actually, an Argentine saying Blacks are their equal is part of their unconscious, Left-wing, racism. The subtitle in english should read, &#8220;Black are our equals, they are failures just like us.&#8221;<br>
Still, I have to say, that most Argentinians will hear you out, if you are respectful and know your stuff and don&rsquo;t let them get away with interrupting you, which they love to do.  But most Mexicans are psychotically violent and would never have let me finish the statement of mine quoted in this post.</p>

This is not as far-fetched as it might sound. I recall a case in UK some 15 or 20 years back, in which a white manager was hauled in front of some sort of Race Relations Tribunal and accused of &#8220;racist body language&#8221; by a black employee. Seems the black had some disagreement with his white boss, and the white had responded with what the black deemed insufficient empathy   &mdash;   as evidenced by the white man&rsquo;s folded arms, frowning, etc. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important to note here is that the white defendant had not actually SAID anything &#8220;racist,&#8221; but was accused of BEING a racist merely because his POSTURE suggested that he didn&rsquo;t think much of what the black was saying to him. </p>
<p>Because of the way the white man stood. </p>
<p>Because of the look on his face. </p>
<p>I sometimes think of this case when I am confronted by some nonwhite misbehavior or other in the public square. If I witness, say, a group of black thugs at the mall acting like black thugs, or a mestizo mother ignoring her rugrats as they scream ceaselessly, and I look askance at them   &mdash;   YET REFRAIN FROM SAYING ANYTHING ALOUD   &mdash;   I wonder if my displeased visage will someday be the subject of an Official Investigation. </p>
<p>If surveillance video of my disapproving face will someday be played back to me in the interrogation room of some &#8220;human rights&#8221; commission. </p>
<p>If some ethnocrat might someday demand that I explain why I appear not to be enjoying The Miracle of Multiculturalism [TM] because of what s/he perceives as a mild scowl on my mug while in the uplifting presence of some Officially Registered Grievance Group or other. </p>
<p>Think it can&rsquo;t happen? </p>
<p>The cameras are already in place. The &#8220;human rights&#8221; commissions/tribunals are already in place. The Will to punish even the mildest expressions of (white) racial dissidence is already in place. All that&rsquo;s needed is the legislation to get the ball rolling&hellip; <br>

			<p>I have often wondered why it is that since we live in such a litigious society, and one, no less, that is obsessed with the demons of genocide and ethnic cleansing and racism, why it is that an action cannot be brought forward. The proof is overwhelming&hellip;we read about it all the time. The facts have already been compiled diligently by men like Jared Taylor. It is easy moreover to accumulate the constant narratives being spewed by Hollywood, the universities, and the media which all are abetting in a genocide. <br>
Why is it that White Nationalism cannot organize a class action suit under Tort law for example. If one looks at the definition for genocide and ethnic cleansing, it says these acts can be brought about by &#8220;any means&#8221;. We are under a constant barrage of  hate, both open and passive aggressive. The proof is in the statistics, and the culprits are out in the open; these would all be joined as parties to the class action: newspapers chains, movie producers, tenured professors etc. <br>
A million dollar retainer to high-profile firm is not that much if you think about it; even if it is a losing law suit, it is worth it, if only for the publicity and attention, and maybe even wake up call it would bring. </p>

my raven-haired love is far away.<br>
I smile at this day&rsquo;s end and know<br>
tomorrow is another day.</p>

Of you<br>
I still dream.</p>
<p>Smooth fair skin and golden hair<br>
when sleep comes to me, you&rsquo;re always there<br>
ever<br>
seventeen.</p>
<p>I kiss you nights, caress your face,<br>
dreading we must part from our embrace<br>
at dawn<br>
when I awake.</p>
<p>When a day&rsquo;s despair towers,<br>
if I can wait a dozen hours<br>
my heart<br>
will not break.</p>
<p>Secret smiles, unnumbered tears,<br>
wicked distance lasting miles and years;<br>
Never<br>

<p>My heart toughened, yours still mild,<br>

Of this<br>
I will weep.</p>

			<p>When it comes to white people  &mdash;  whether they are kids, teens, young adults, or all grown up, the effects of the constant drumming, the constant charges of white crimes and guilt over slavery and other supposed important issues involving whites crimes against humanity  &mdash;   has done its work. It is so deeply ingrained in the minds of whites of all ages, and classes, that they cannot even  think straight issues concerning minorities are in play. The behavior of most whites, where minorities are concerned, is totally unauthentic, based in fear, and cannot in any way resolve racial issues in this country. Issues of any kind are resolved by honestly bringing them out into the open and examining all sides. However, if this were done, than the cure for whites would soon be at hand, which is why every road block is thrown in the way to prevent real, honest, debate. People like Mr. Taylor and others see this constantly.</p>

			<p> had an incident related to this study that should be the basis for additional scientific research. I was in Argentina in the fall of 2007 for about 6-7 hours and wanted to see some of Buenos Aires. A black cab driver waived to me, so I jumped in his cab. </p>

<p>Hmmm. Gotta say, your story doesn&rsquo;t sound very convincing. I go there once a year for a month or two and even lived there for two and a half years at one point (2000 - 2003).  I never saw ONE black cab driver. I&rsquo;m not saying there aren&rsquo;t any, I just never saw one, and I&rsquo;ve been in hundreds of cabs in BA and lots of them at the airport.<br>
 Plus, a driver at the airport wouldn&rsquo;t just wave to you, like, &#8220;Hey, over here, take my cab.&#8221;  There&rsquo;s a line like anywhere else and cabbies aren&rsquo;t going to jump the line for obvious reasons. Plus, if you&rsquo;re spanish isn&rsquo;t very good, you stand a good chance of being ripped off by ANY of the cab drivers there.<br>
But the rest of your story sounded believable.</p>

			<p>Svigor, the media may not hide the high black illegitimacy rate; indeed,they may even admit it, but they won&rsquo;t blame blacks. For example: the editorial page editor for THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION, a liberal rag, is a very left-wing, defensive, biased black female Democrat. Even she readily acknowledges that 2/3 or in some areas 4/5 black children are born out of wedlock, but on whom does she place the blame? You guessed it: &#8220;right-wing&#8221; politicians or groups, &#8220;religious fanatics,&#8221; Republicans(George W., of course), on anyone else who doesn&rsquo;t believe minors should be given birth control pills and condoms or allowed to have abortions without their parents&rsquo; knowledge /consent.  I do realize that some blacks adhere to these conservative beliefs.<br>

I understand your points about Argentinean corruption and so on. I agree.  The point I was making had to do with race and not so much nationality.  I&rsquo;ve gotten so much flack from my fellow Americans just because I was born in Argentina and speak Spanish.  Of course they are very surprised by my speaking Spanish with the looks that I have.  You would never know.  Race is more important than where we came from.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I was saying about Argentineans was that all of them, yes ALL of them, never grew up around blacks so they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re like.  I know plenty of Americans who are the same way.  We are all creatures of habit and experience so this is not surprising.  So if those in Argentina have never experienced blacks and those in Massachusetts or Minnesota have never experienced them either then we will be in the same boat.  The black race is not superior to us in any country.  That is what you have to remember.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten so much flack from my fellow Americans just because I was born in Argentina and speak Spanish.</p>

<p>Really Ben?  Why would they give you are hard time just for that?  They sound like a bunch of Boludos.  </p>
<p>To continue the discussion&hellip; I have to say that, though you are right, that someone from Argentina, and someone from Minnesota, don&rsquo;t know much about Blacks, I have found that the Argentinians were far more open to discussion on the subject.  Not all of them, but the majority. White Americans who are not well-versed on the subject tend to get jumpy and defensive.</p>
<p>Also, out of fairness I do want to qualify my previous post and say that I was not refering to all Argentinians.  In fact, I was mostly refering to the knee-jerk Anti-American ones. But, again, in my experience with that country, they were always the minority.  I also have to say that in the States, at least in the circles I ran in, you never knew how many disagreements would end in a fist fight.  But I never got that feeling in Argentina.  Though I have enjoyed my time in Argentina, it really disappointed me to realize just how violent and closed-minded so many Americans can be. </p>

			<p>Wow. I have to say I&rsquo;m disappointed in my race once more. Why do ethnic Europeans allow themselves to be put into an intellectual box and operate out of fear? Stop being fearful, it&rsquo;s uselss. Be on the offensive, not the defensive. Stop being weak.</p>

			<p>I agree with everything said here generally, but for almost the first time in my working life, there are actually a couple black people in my workplace who are capable of intelligent, not-necessarily black-orientated conversation, who get puns, ironies and abstract jokes, and who even read British lit. One has been married to the same man for decades.  The other is probably one of the several thousand blacks in the U.S. with an iq over 130. Come to think of it, in my last job there was a black lady who had worked in the film industry, and she was pretty damn smart self-sufficient, and hard working. She could talk with me about any esoteric subject I brought up and had solid information, not babble fantasies. So you never know.   Generally though, I don&rsquo;t even try real conversation with blacks.</p>
