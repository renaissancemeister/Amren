						<p>At-large School Board member Tina Hone questioned the validity of data that shows a &#8220;morality gap&#8221; between white students and some minority groups in Fairfax County Public Schools.</p>
<p>At-large school board member Tina Hone walked off the dais during Fairfax County Public Schools&rsquo; presentation on student &#8220;essential life skills&#8221; March 27.</p>
<p>For the first time, the school system provided student achievement data in areas related to character and morality development. Officials used information from elementary school report cards, student surveys and school discipline rates to determine student performance in these areas.</p>
<p>Data showed a significant gap between elementary and middle school students who are white or Asian and those who are black or Hispanic in areas like &#8220;demonstrates sound moral character and ethical judgment,&#8221; &#8220;contributes effectively within a group dynamic,&#8221; has &#8220;skills to manage and resolved conflicts&#8221; and &#8220;develop practical life skills.&#8221;</p>
<p>White and Asian students performed better in these areas than other minority groups as well as students with limited English, students who are poor, and students receiving special education services.</p>
<p>For example, among third graders, school system graphs show that 95 percent of white and Asian students &#8220;demonstrate sound moral character and ethical judgment.&#8221; They show only 82 percent of black students, 86 percent of Hispanic students, 84 percent of students who qualify for free and reduced lunch, 88 percent of students who are limited English proficient and 83 percent of students who qualify for special education services achieve in the same area.</p>
<p>Hone, one of only two non-white members of the school board, said she was &#8220;troubled&#8221; by the report, particularly the gap between black and Hispanic students and their peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are we sure this gap is not an assessment failure? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that some of this is not about fixing our staff?&#8221; said Hone [one of only two non-white members of the school board] during last week&rsquo;s school board meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School board member Kathy Smith (Sully) said the data could reflect a need for more teacher training on issues like cultural sensitivity.</p>

			<p>Since Our Better Minds cannot accept the fact that this might be the result of innate racial differences, then it will have to be blamed on racism.  Morality itself is racist.</p>

			<p>I doubt the numbers for the black and brown students were actually as high as those posted in this article. I went to school with mostly hispanics and blacks and the overwhelming majorities of these groups were troublesome to put it very mildly. </p>

			<p>Well this test is out the door pretty soon. Who needs such information when it obviouly points toward racist superior thinking on the part of whites and asians.</p>
<p>I suppose WHITES figured out all these silly rules and regulations, which would mean they are racist in the first place. </p>

<p>School administrators should save themselves time and money by only testing White students. </p>
<p>If the non-Whites demand to be tested also, simply refuse to give them the test and tell them   &mdash;   &#8220;The testing procedures are not enlightened enough to make every group score the same on each and every test.  We are sure your child is just as smart and moral as any White child but we just can&rsquo;t seem to be able to test for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I would have left the meeting in protest, because the black/Hispanic figures were obviously inflated for political reasons.</p>
<p>Nobody with any experience living around both these groups would disagree with that assessment, knowing of the constant bad attitudes rife among blacks carping about imagined injustices that have no basis in reality, plus the constant denigration of all peoples, not just whites.</p>
<p>Hispanics are not quite as bad, so they would have a higher percentage.</p>
<p>The percentages for these groups should be in the vicinity of 20% for blacks and 60% for Hispanics.  And I really believe I&rsquo;m being charitable to blacks.</p>

<p>Holy mackerel, the monster is still alive.  I taught for 33 years and this sort of manure was repeatedly shovelled at me.  I, of course, resisted the idea from several administrators that I should deal with students differently according to their so-called cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best time of my career was the day I witnessed an assistant principal get cussed up one side and down the other by an African pupil.  With his face beet red and simmering from this verbal assault, the &#8220;suit&#8221; looked quickly to see if anyone had heard this tirade aimed at him.</p>
<p>Risking a lot of professional status but not one bit of self-respect, I leaned toward his ear, quietly advising him that he&rsquo;d get over it if he simply considered the cultural background of this thug who&rsquo;d called him names the rest of us were supposed to &#8216;understand&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For some reason, he took a different job the next year in an all-White school system.</p>

			<p>My wife commented about this &#8220;morality gap&#8221; once, when we were stuck in the snow in my Saturn.  Sure enough, someone stopped to help us.  He was white, and probably in his late twenties.  He pulled us out with my tow chains and his truck.</p>
<p>My wife still doesn&rsquo;t know who to trust here, but she said nonwhites would not have stopped to help us, and she suspects I would not have accepted their help, anyway.</p>
<p>The willingness of white people to help folks is one of the things that makes us great.  I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it that way, but in Japan I had the name &#8220;Scott&#8221; on my front door, and a naked young woman who had been raped knocked on my door one evening.  I am flattered to this day that she thought a hakajin would help her.  Since I was living on the third floor, I must assume she was loooking for a European name.</p>
<p>I had her call her father, who picked her up.  I imagined I had lost a nice bathrobe and sweatpants, but her father brought those back eventually, along with 5000 yen.  Fifty bucks I tried to refuse.</p>
<p>Of *course* I was going to help her.  I am now a felon on the Terrorist Watch List and was not then, but what sort of man would I be if I hadn&rsquo;t helped the poor gal?  </p>
<p>Of course there is a morality gap.  Decent men don&rsquo;t hurt women, and being a white man is at least *supposed* to be the best thing anyone can be, so I try to live up to it.</p>
<p>I doubt it, but I also don&rsquo;t take what I have for granted.</p>

			<p>Morality/race is core to behavior.  USA had strong morally based laws and they were strickly enforced creating a great country until the civil rights movement changed legal system to give every other race preference regardless of behavior.  The usual reasoning is whites profile others but I submit whites give others leeway because they understand the differences in behaviors and some unwillingness to keep our laws. Look at countries where different races have created their own moral systems and we see totalitarian communist states and transient leaders where laws are subject to kings/queens, &amp; self defined rulers.  <br>
USA is not perfect but gives individuals more opportunities than other places. When will those of other races give US credit for what we have created and given to so many??????  V</p>

<p>That sentiment was considered common knowledge for centuries, if not longer - see Kipling&rsquo;s <i>White Man&rsquo;s Burden</i>, etc.  </p>
<p>Today, thanks to the hippies and &#8220;progressives&#8221;, everyone is supposed to believe the exact opposite.  But I increasingly suspect that people still feel it in their bones in spite of media efforts to tarnish us.  There is a kernel of honor in the hearts of traditional white men that&rsquo;s a grade above other races.  </p>
<p>Thank you for your story, your perspective and your noble actions.  You&rsquo;re a credit to our race.  </p>

<p>While, one might start by reading The Color of Crime.  Then one might actually read the rich literature on IQ and aggressiveness.  Of course this would require both an open mind and the ability to read beyond the 8th grade level, neither of which this woman appears to have.</p>

			<p>Anyone want to bet on the race of Ms. Tina Hone?</p>
<p>I also notice, that while the test results were broken down according to RACE, race was never considered a cause or a factor. They acknowledge a racial difference, but can&rsquo;t comprehend  a racial difference caused by a difference in race. And these are college &#8220;educated&#8221; edukators?</p>
<p>I love the smugness I feel when I realize I am smarter than these Education Phd graduates. </p>
<p>Actually, they ALL know it is due to genetic racial difference but not one of them will say the Earth Moves. The Inquisition is live and well and one must not question the New Religion of Equality. Ever.</p>
<p>Why do they conduct these tests? They &#8220;know&#8221; the outcome. Why do they break them down into racial catagories when they don&rsquo;t recognize race or they claim race is never a factor in racial catagories? Am I going insane?</p>
<p>They should just give the test and give the total response. Something like 89% percent of our students have &#8220;moral character&#8221;. Leave it alone at that and be happy to ask for more money to raise this &#8220;score&#8221; to some arbitrary level. The &#8220;level&#8221; of success is not important since the reason for the test is to guilt trip the tax payers into MORE MONEY. It is not to solve this or any other problem.</p>

			<p>Schools cannot, and should not be expected to instill morals in children.  This process is started way before a child is sent to school to be &#8220;indoctrinated&#8221;.  It is the parent&rsquo;s responsibility.  If parents cannot instill morals, a very very basic responsibility, then they should not be allowed to raise children.  And they certainly should not be allowed to raise them on the taxpayer&rsquo;s dollar.  But alas we live in a welfare society that does not care about the welfare of the society, only the individual.</p>

			<p>White teachers need more sensitivity training when black and brown children can&rsquo;t be made to behave?  How about more training for the black and brown mothers?  Of course at the taxpayers expense, since we are paying for all other aspects of raising these children.</p>

			<p>Look here,white people were told,&rdquo;you are like us.&rdquo;We freed you,tried to teach you to read.We let you be separate,you built nothing.We included you,you hated us.You kill us,like you kill your own kind,random,ruthless,unfeeling.We were unaware that you lack empathy for others.That you imitate but can&rsquo;t initiate or innovate.We had no clue you didn&rsquo;t know how put up bananas for winter.Because we had cared for you as slaves.<br>
We provided for you a place to live(section 8 housing) and sustenance(food stamps,unemployment).We had no idea you would rip that apart.That you have no gratitude.We put in systems that allowed you to work beside white people.You simplified them,debase them.Any perceived slight you cry racism.<br>
I am one of a number that grows everyday.White people that have become aware,that living around blacks,latins cannot nor will not continue.We simply had no idea you have no ideals about beauty,refinement,organizing,future plans,nothing.That blame game is your release of the frustration of not having the European mind.</p>

			<p>this reminds me of the argument that IQ tests are culturally biased against certain ethnic groups. or, to put it another way, certain cultures are not conducive to the given tests. now, i suppose we can say that certain cultures are not conducive to the given standards of morality. and, you know, it really is quite arrogant for us to subject others to our standards of morality. after all, who are we to say that a culture which values honesty and integrity is better than one that values lying, cheating, stealing or even rape and murder, for that matter. you know, it may just be part of their culture and we should learn to respect that. oh, wait. did i say we should learn to &#8220;respect that&#8221;. i meant to say, &#8220;we should learn to EXPECT that.&#8221; and that&rsquo;s exactly what i&rsquo;ve come to expect from many of them.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;&hellip;.The willingness of white people to help folks is one of the things that makes us great. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it that way&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Posted by Michael Scott</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t used to think that way either, especially after decades of government-sponsored/sanctioned indoctrination that put forth the unquestioned dogma that all races are equal in every way.  This message was pounded into me especially in ed school.</p>
<p>Several years ago I was broadsided in a busy intersection by a Filipino man who ran a red light at a high rate of speed.  The insurance adjuster told me later that if I hadn&rsquo;t been in a certain model of Toyota, reinforced for the American market, I and my baby would have been killed (which has made me ever-loyal to Toyota, I&rsquo;m on my third one&hellip;but I digress).</p>
<p>I managed to crawl out of the passenger side of my car with my baby and run to the side of the road. After viewing the wreckage, which was now blocking traffic, I became hysterical which caused my baby to start screaming as well.</p>
<p>The man who hit me immediately and loudly proclaimed that I had caused the accident &mdash; he didn&rsquo;t even bother to ask me if I or my baby needed medical help or even if we were OK.  Later he tried to sue me and stated that there were four other people in his car all of whom were grievously injured.  As I had a police report showing that I was not at fault, my insurance company let him have it with both barrels (turns out he didn&rsquo;t have insurance).</p>
<p>The ONLY ones who stopped to see if I and my baby were OK were White males.  Let me repeat:  ONLY White males stopped to see if a sobbing White female holding a tiny baby needed any help.  As I was in LA, White males do not make up a majority of those who were driving by, but they were certainly the only ones who stopped to offer any kind of assistance.</p>
<p>Several pulled off the road, got out and offered to call my family, use of their cell phones, rides, money, offers to fetch diapers or anything else I or my baby needed.  Two stayed with me until the police arrived and even then only left after I repeatedly assured them that I was OK.  I couldn&rsquo;t believe the outpouring of generosity and kindness &mdash; maybe that was the first crack in the veneer of the PC brain washing I&rsquo;d received.</p>
<p>This was a lesson not lost on me.</p>
<p>I now try to &lsquo;pass it forward&rsquo; &mdash; but I will only help my own, as I believe others should help their own, and that includes monetary donations as well.</p>
<p>The other day, I insisted DH turn around and pull the car over when I spotted an elderly couple sitting in their motor home by the side of the road.  They told me they couldn&rsquo;t get the motor home started, had no cell phone, were afraid to get out and walk and had been sitting there for hours waiting for someone to stop and help.  DH managed to get the motor home started with jumper cables and then we followed them to the nearest gas station.</p>
<p>Believe me, I am no bleeding heart, but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to stop and ask if a hysterical woman and baby are OK or if a stranded elderly couple need assistance. It costs nothing  &mdash;  and I now believe that Whites are the ones who have this tendency to help others.</p>

			<p>Hoisted on the own petard.  Kinda funny.  Because blacks and hispanics can&rsquo;t keep up scholastically, they began introducing &#8220;other factors&#8221; into the overal assessment of students, thinking they&rsquo;d be &#8220;easy A&rsquo;s&#8221; because they ARE for white kids.  Now, even that is coming back to haunt them!  Surprise, surprise, blacks and hispanics also fail in these categories also.  I don&rsquo;t know WHY that should surprise these educational scholastic geniuses and professors.  it&rsquo;s called cause and effect dummies.  The REASON blacks and hispanics don&rsquo;t do as well scholastically, is because socially they are failues also, which leads to their low grades.  They&rsquo;d rather disrupt classes, cause problems, threaten teachers, be a smart-alek, be the clown of the class, be hitting on anything with a heartbeat, and proving themselves worthy of the gangs they establish in the schools.</p>

			<p>I have heard second hand that in one public school, the blacks and hispanics are out of control. I&rsquo;m talking about grades three through five. One teacher is not having her contract renewed next year for having demonstrated her inability to control a classroom. This young white woman who has many years left of paying off her school loans is now going to have to try to find another job with this experience hanging around her neck. </p>

			<p>To Tony Soprano:</p>
<p>I know your post was intended to be humorous, but I feel poverty does NOT necessarily lead to crime. Morality and personal core values (or the lack thereof), also play a role.</p>
<p>Witness Michael Vick and his dogfighting operations, Mike Tyson and his rapes and brutality against women antics, Rae Carruth (ex of the Carolina Panthers) ordering his girlfriend killed, Kobe Bryant and his sex scandals, and O. J. Simpson. Millionaires, all of them, and STILL they behaved like the run of the mill  black gangbangers. No one can say poverty played a role in their crimes, so it had to be something else.</p>

			<p>Blacks and Hispanics have lower moral character? Funny but I&rsquo;ve been called a racist for publicly stating that. Now it appears I am not a racist at all   &mdash;   apparently I have just been telling the truth!</p>
<p>That our maximum security prisons are packed with Hispanics and Blacks eloquently speaks for itself. NO! They are NOT incarcerated because they had a worthless lawyer, were framed by a crooked prosecutor or sentenced by a biased jury. They&rsquo;re incarcerated because THEY BELONG IN PRISON   &mdash;   for the crimes they&rsquo;ve done!</p>
<p>Lately our local rag, the Houston Chronicle, has been bending over backward to try to NOT identify the race of the perps hitting the news. Now would ANYONE CARE TO GUESS WHY?  (Hint: The perp is either Black of Latino! Any questions?)</p>

<p>yes, that&rsquo;s right, society needs to incorporate the moral character of poc&rsquo;s into the test, because morality and character are flexible, and what ponc&rsquo;s might consider immoral can be perfectly normal in a poc culture. for example, rape, theft, and even murder are routinely practiced by poc culture yet are considered poor character traits by ponc. when in doubt, lower the bar so as to include as many poc&rsquo;s as possible</p>

<p>That differs among certain high IQ folks according to their cultures, apparently.</p>
<p>As to the woman hit by the Filipino driver, here in L.A. the Filipino&rsquo;s are well known for insurance scams and scams period. For example, one of their favorites is walking up to a car driven by a white person (because whites follow the law and have insurance) that&rsquo;s backing out of a spot at a shopping center or bank etc. The Filipino will tap on the driver&rsquo;s window and ask an innocent question about the center, bank whatever. While the white is answering, the Filipino&rsquo;s partner will roll their car up behind the white person&rsquo;s car. If the white person just starts to drive again without completely checking the background, they&rsquo;ll hit the Filipino&rsquo;s car. Then the Filipinos will scream bloody murder and sue the daylights out of you. I&rsquo;m aware of this scam and was amusing in a sad way when one of these friendly Asians tried to pull it on me. It&rsquo;s not only IQ, it&rsquo;s culture. </p>

			<p>One one looks at the racial disparity in crime statistics the conclusions of this report are no surprise at all.  Black and brown schools are riddled with poor academic performance, hooliganism and violence.  If 82% of blacks and browns were actually of sound moral character then are we to believe that only 18% are causing all of the problems?  The percentages must have got reversed or manipulated to make minorities appear better than they really are.  </p>
<p>Interesting story Bonbon.  White people are almost too altruistic for their own good.  Whites have lost their sense of &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221; and too often help hateful and unappreciative non-whites. If your incident was made into a MSM television show all of the white people who offered help would be rewritten as black, mexican and asian while white men flying confederate flags would have been trying to harm you and your child.   </p>

<p>Our kindness only makes us great in a homogenous society where everyone helps others out. Blacks perceive kindness as weakness and will take advantage of us every chance they get.  I work around mostly black people and I have learned to survive by going against my natural inclination to help people; they respect me because I know how to act like they do.  <br>

			<p>The percentages for these groups should be in the vicinity of 20% for blacks and 60% for Hispanics. And I really believe I&rsquo;m being charitable to blacks. w.r.</p>
<p>  In the rural South the black rate is around 60% as well.  It is also higher for blacks in some parts of the Midwest. However, you are totally correct about the numbers in most of the Northeast and many urban Southern and Midwestern metropolitian areas.  </p>

<p>What do the others here observe?&#8221;  - I observe a personal bias on your part against intelligent people. </p>
<p>Why do you dislike them?  Has an intelligent person ever stepped out of a dark alley, or snuck up on you to do you the harm of saying something intelligent?</p>
<p>Hollywood has played no small role in this nefarious programming of a negative view of the intelligent (the very people most likely to be able to improve our lives, or even save them).  I have wondered for years why that might be, but now I wonder if it may be because intelligence tends to be associated with white people. </p>
<p>We are often entertained by tales of evil genius, to the extent that we forget that most geniuses are not only not evil, but have done so much good for the rest of mankind that it would be nearly impossible to catalogue. </p>
<p>It is, and always has been, intelligent people that move us forward, and fools who drag us down.</p>
<p>The criminals that fill our jails and afflict our society with their predation are demonstrably less intelligent, on the whole, than the rest of society.  </p>
<p>It is intelligent people who come up with solutions to problems, and who generate ideas and create things.  </p>
<p>Intelligent people are more able to understand why they should respect and follow rules, they have the requisite intelligence to understand consequences and the impact of their behavior on society around them, and why that matters to them.</p>
<p>(It really is quite simple- the same reason you wouldn&rsquo;t urinate in the pool you are swimming in.  Then again, perhaps fools actually do so.)</p>
<p>No diseases cured or cared for were so handled by idiots- it requires intelligence.</p>
<p>All the devices you use that make your life so much richer &amp; easier, such as the computer system which you are using at this very moment, (not to mention the development of all the things necessary to even conceive of such a system in the first place), were made not by idiots, but by intelligent people.</p>
<p>Would you consider an idiot a more reliable mechanic to insure your car&rsquo;s safety than an intelligent one?  Do you prefer to have idiots build the bridges you will drive that vehicle over? </p>
<p>Intelligent people are smart enough to know the value of being straightforward &amp; reliable.  The traits you describe are more typical of fools than of the intelligent. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s called predictive validity.</p>
<p>Predictive validity: <br>
Predictive validity refers to the degree to which the operationalization can predict (or correlate with) with other measures of the same construct that are measured at some time in the future. </p>
<p>If blacks are 7 times more likely to commit homicide, have higher rates of drug use and sexually transmitted diseases&hellip; then one would expect blacks to have, on average, lower moral character scores.<br>

<p>My wife still doesn&rsquo;t know who to trust here, but she said nonwhites would not have stopped to help us, and she suspects I would not have accepted their help, anyway.</p>
<p>The willingness of white people to help folks is one of the things that makes us great. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it that way, but in Japan I had the name &ldquo;Scott&rdquo; on my front door, and a naked young woman who had been raped knocked on my door one evening. I am flattered to this day that she thought a hakajin would help her. Since I was living on the third floor, I must assume she was loooking for a European name.</p>
<p>I had her call her father, who picked her up. I imagined I had lost a nice bathrobe and sweatpants, but her father brought those back eventually, along with 5000 yen. Fifty bucks I tried to refuse.</p>
<p>Of course I was going to help her. I am now a felon on the Terrorist Watch List and was not then, but what sort of man would I be if I hadn&rsquo;t helped the poor gal? </p>
<p>Of course there is a morality gap. Decent men don&rsquo;t hurt women, and being a white man is at least supposed to be the best thing anyone can be, so I try to live up to it.</p>
<p>I doubt it, but I also don&rsquo;t take what I have for granted.</p>
