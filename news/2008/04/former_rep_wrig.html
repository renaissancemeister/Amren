<h1>Former Rep. Wright Sentenced to 6-8 Years for Fraud</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, April 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former Rep. Thomas Wright was sentenced Monday to roughly six years to eight years in prison after a jury found him guilty of mishandling thousands of dollars in charitable contributions and fraudulently obtaining a $150,000 loan.</p>
<p>Deputies immediately took Wright into custody after Wake County Superior Court Judge Henry Hight imposed the sentence and rejected a request to allow the former lawmaker to remain free during an appeal. Wright winked at his wife Joyce as he left the courtroom.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jurors convicted Wright on three felony fraud charges, concluding he misused or mishandled donations from two companies totaling $7,400 and used a bogus letter to take out a loan to build a museum commemorating Wilmington&rsquo;s 1898 race riots. He faced four counts, but jurors decided he did not mishandle a $1,500 donation from AT&T; Corp.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is just another unpleasant chapter in what we&rsquo;ve been dealing with for the last two to three years,&#8221; said Wake County prosecutor Colon Willoughby. &#8220;I think he just forgot who he was supposed to be serving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harris said it was unfair to try Wright so soon after he was kicked out of office for ethical misconduct. Wright&rsquo;s colleagues in the House voted overwhelmingly last month to expel Wright from office, following the recommendation of a special legislative ethics panel that investigated allegations almost identical to those Wright faced in court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Once he finally took the stand last week, [Wright] blamed his mistakes on sloppy record keeping and insisted he never showed the letter to a bank loan officer, a key element of that fraud charge. He also said his legal troubles began after he failed to support the re-election of Democratic Sen. Julia Boseman of Wilmington in the November 2006 election.</p>
