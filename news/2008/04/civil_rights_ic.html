						<p>A jury convicted an iconic civil rights figure of incest Thursday after concluding that he had sex with his teenage daughter 15 years ago.</p>
<p>The Rev. James L. Bevel, 71, a top lieutenant to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. who also helped organize the Million Man March, faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced.</p>
<p>The four-day trial in Loudoun County Circuit Court included bizarre testimony about Bevel&rsquo;s philosophies for eradicating lust, and parents&rsquo; duty to &#8220;sexually orient&#8221; their children.</p>
<p>Bevel&rsquo;s daughter testified that she was repeatedly molested by Bevel beginning when she was just 6 years old, culminating in an act of sexual intercourse in 1993 or 1994 that formed the basis of the incest charge.</p>
<p>The jury reached its verdict after about three hours of deliberations.</p>
<p>Before the verdict, the jury had heard only passing reference to Bevel&rsquo;s role in the civil rights movement. But during the sentencing phase of the trial Thursday afternoon, the jury saw a documentary that spelled out Bevel&rsquo;s key role in organizing the 1963 Birmingham Children&rsquo;s Crusade. Bevel and King were leading organizers of the marches, in which police turned fire hoses and dogs on child protesters, drawing international attention to the brutality that was keeping segregation in place in the South.</p>
<p>Bevel was also a leading organizer at other iconic events in the civil rights movement, including the 1965 march at Selma, Ala.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jurors heard a phone call between Bevel and his daughter in which he never explicitly admits to sexual intercourse but seems to take for granted that it occurred. During the call he explains the importance of teaching his daughter &#8220;the science of marriage&#8221; and admits that he did not want her to get pregnant after the incident.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Public defender Bonnie Hoffman urged the jury to ignore evidence that Bevel led an unconventional, communal lifestyle in which he taught that it was parents&rsquo; duty to &#8220;sexually orient&#8221; their children.</p>
<p>Instead, she told the jury to focus on the single incident for which Bevel was charged: an act of sexual intercourse that occurred in 1993 or 1994 while the daughter was a teenager and was living with her father in Leesburg.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutor Nicole Wittmann warned the jury against getting confused by Bevel&rsquo;s sometimes convoluted explanations of his philosophies and his justifications for his actions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Associated Press generally does not identify the victims of sexual abuse. The daughter is one of 16 children Bevel said he has had with several different women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The jury must recommend a prison term ranging between five and 20 years. The judge will then have the option to accept the recommendation or lower it, but he cannot increase it.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, Bevel was a leader in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, two of the stalwart organizations that led efforts to desegregate the South.</p>
<p>In 1992, he was vice presidential running mate to political maverick Lyndon LaRouche, who has a home in Loudoun County but at the time was in a federal prison for a tax conviction.<br>

			<p>In Fresno,CA several years ago, there was a black career welfare recipient who fathered about 10 children.He did very little work in his lifetime. In the end, not long after he got out of jail for welfare fraud, he ended up killing 8 or 10 of those children, two of which he fathered with HIS OWN DAUGHTERS.He went on the fast track to Death Row.</p>

			<p> I would just be curious to know what the racial makeup of that jury was since blacks are notoriously reluctant to hold their own to accountability and routinely engage in jury nullification.</p>

			<p>A black man that worked for my grandfather died recently. Word around their small GA town was that this man did the same thing to his daughter. He wanted her to know what men wanted to do to her. This man ran a &#8216;shot house&rsquo; at one time. When he died, he was a deacon in a church. ???????????</p>
<p>NAACP President Kweisi Mfume fathered 5 children out of wedlock.</p>
<p>NAACP Chairman Julian Bond used cocain daily, was charged with possession and intent to distrubute, and he consorted with women with priors. </p>

<p>&#8220;Convoluted explanations.&#8221;  That describes about every black attempting to use reason and logic he perceives to be persuasive in trying to convince someone of something, but is really nothing more than disorganized babbling.</p>
<p>Every black talking head on television&hellip;..every single one&hellip;..comes across the same way in making excuses for this Jeremiah Wright.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but it makes me firmly believe that their group I.Q. average in the US has been padded, and is really the same as Africans, which is about 70.</p>

			<p>The strange fate of Rev. Bevel!  I knew the man back in 1983, when I was a student at Hiram College (Ohio).  Bevel was running a non-profit organization down the street called Organofarms Project, which was dedicated to spreading the practice of organic farming.  Several men of Bevel&rsquo;s flock worked at the farm, as did I that summer, one of only two white guys.  I found his &ldquo;teachings&rdquo; bizarre, even then.</p>
<p>He preached that at some point, every man should walk naked amongst the community.  His son, about 20 years old, dutifully paraded around the farm naked for a day.</p>
<p>Bevel also preached that &ldquo;sex is for making babies,&rdquo; and &ldquo;raising children is woman&rsquo;s work&rdquo; (I remember the exact words clearly).  Not surprisingly, the black men of his church went around repeating these words.  Since then I have blamed black leadership for out-of-wedlock births in the &ldquo;community,&rdquo; although the pattern seems inherently African.</p>
<p>Some of us at the farm were amused when Bevel would appear with his two &ldquo;concubines,&rdquo; as we called them &mdash; two young women, both of whom with infants by him, neither of whom his wife.  I always felt sorry for his 20 year-old son, who was so dedicated to his &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; father, but so ignored by him.</p>
<p>Bevel never did much work around the farm, mostly putting his energy into inspiring people.  One day, he just disappeared, never to return, leaving his son and the project behind.  Strangely, the truck belonging to farm&rsquo;s owner (a gentle elderly man who just wanted someone to grow organic produce) had also disappeared that day.  Just the facts, man.<br>

<p>-Yes, Race Realist, but you describe sordid affairs between consenting adults (even the young pages were 18?). These are not equivalent to molesting your<br>
own daughter and fathering inbred offspring into our once shinier American society. Sex with a minor is not considered consensual. How many prominent Whites have done the equivalent to their daughters? (and I qualified this statement with the word PROMINENT).</p>
<p>When you are a parent, you are conservative by definition because you are the child&rsquo;s mentor, provider and protector. How is it considered anything of value to sexually prey on your own children? Is this guy so lame that he cannot look outside his home and use his &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; record as a way to woo the ladies? The over-sexualisation of America attempts to condone ALL behaviors, whether palatable or not.</p>
<p>Talk about abuse of freedom.</p>

			<p>The ad hominem argument has validity.  When a person violates one standard of behavior, it is more likely that he will violate others.  How many murders do you find who refuse to steal or lie?  </p>
<p>The civil rights movement was a despotic violation of people&rsquo;s God given right to use their property for their own needs.  Stealing in other words.  How many men agree to take what is not theirs but hold back their perversion because it violates another&rsquo;s right.  </p>
<p>Furthermore men ruled by their perversion will be drawn to an enterprise that&rsquo;s inundated with vice. Turn over a civil rights rock and out come the moral creepy-crawlers.<br>

			<p>Birds of a feather? King beat up two white women the night before he got wacked. Lowery said that he couldn`t take yes for an answer. This cretin fathers an entire choir. At first I thought he played for the Lakers but 16 *astard kids wouldn`t even put him on the NBA All Whose Your Daddy team so I read further and found out he was one of the Intergators. Ask any white woman who was in the movement. Every night the black leaders demanded that they integrate. You can`t say bad things about the,. Like Obama and Jackson, they are all sacred cows.<br>
