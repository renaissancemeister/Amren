						<p>The latest advertising campaign in Mexico from Swedish vodka maker Absolut promises to push all the right buttons south of the U.S. border, but it could ruffle a few feathers in El Norte.</p>
<p>The U.S.-Mexico border lies where it was before the Mexican-American war of 1848 when California, as we now know it, was Mexican territory and known as Alta California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The campaign taps into the national pride of Mexicans, according to Favio Ucedo, creative director of leading Latino advertising agency Grupo Gallegos in the U.S.</p>
<p>Ucedo, who is from Argentina, said: &#8220;Mexicans talk about how the Americans stole their land, so this is their way of reclaiming it. It&rsquo;s very relevant and the Mexicans will love the idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he said that were the campaign to run in the United States, it might fall flat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people aren&rsquo;t going to understand it here. Americans in the East and the North or in the center of the county &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know if they know much about the history.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reader Paul Green goes into a discussion on the blog Gateway Pundit of whether the U.S. territories ever belonged to Mexico in the first place, and the News12 Long island site invited people to boycott Absolut, with one user, called LivingSmall, writing: &#8220;If you drink Absolut vodka, you can voice your approval or disapproval of this advertising campaign with your purchases. I know I will be switching to Grey Goose or Stoli and will never have another bottle of Absolut in my house.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This is a chance to show solidarity.  Never never never never purchase another bottle of Absolut Vodka again.  </p>
<p>Based on research I conducted (using google) immediately after seeing the new Absolut ad:</p>
<p>1 - The United States accounts for 46.845% of worldwide sales of Absolut brand Vodka (5,027,000 cases (9 bottles per case) of 1 liter bottles).<br>
2 - Absolut Vodka is imported by &#8220;Absolut Spirits Company, Inc.&#8221; which is a subsidiary of V&S; Group.<br>
3 - The V&S; Group website lists its other products as the following:</p>
<p>Vodka<br>
» ABSOLUT VODKA<br>
» Level Vodka<br>
» Frïs Vodka<br>
» Luksusowa</p>
<p>Aquavit<br>
» AALBORG JUBILÆUMS Akvavit<br>
» Malteserkreuz Aquavit<br>
» O.P. Anderson Aquavit</p>
<p>Bitters<br>
» GAMMEL DANSK Bitter Dram</p>
<p>Rum<br>
» Cruzan Rum</p>
<p>Peppermint Liquor<br>
» MINTTU</p>
<p>Gin<br>
» Plymouth Gin</p>
<p>Wine<br>
» Nordic Partners<br>
» California White &amp; California Red<br>
» Blossa Glögg<br>
» Chill Out<br>
» Chymos<br>
» Opal Springs<br>
» Santa Christina</p>
<p>Do not purchase their products.  If V&S; tries to change the name of the brand to avoid a boycott in America, we should notify amren so they can post it.  </p>
<p>Ask your local retailers to stop stocking Absolut.  If they won&rsquo;t, then take your business to someone who will.  </p>
<p>Solidarity.</p>

			<p>Rather than boycotting Absolut, I think we should thank them for showing in a graphical way just what the Mexican mentality is. I hope this campaign is a unqualified success in Mexico. I also hope this ad appears reproduced permanently on every anti-immigration site on the web. There&rsquo;s no chance of it appearing in the MSM, however.</p>

			<p>Who is going to stop them.  This is why Congress does not intend building any border fense.  Congress does not want to spend 4 billion dollars on a fence that will in a few years be torn down because its no longer a border.  Congress is poised to give Hawaii away and maybe Key West.  Neither of the Soviet Senate leaders running for President will oppose it.</p>

<p>That pretty much sums thing up, so way to go LivingSmall!</p>
<p>It might amuse the Swedish Absolut executives to take the La Raza line, but I think that their sales in the USA will go the way of a T-Rex on bad crack. This is hardly a time to be pulling a stunt like this when we have 20 million of these peons in this country illegally, but no &ldquo;good deed&rdquo; goes unpunished. I hope that enough Americans are exposed to this stupid advertisement, to get the message loud and clear, we are being invaded by the &ldquo;passive&rdquo; troops of another country. </p>
<p>A country that is our enemy and always has been, and always will be! </p>

			<p>Whoever the Ad Exec is who approved this ridiculous ad, He should be fired immediately. Did he attend the same MBA school as the Chimp-In-Chief? How much Absolut is drank by poor Mexicans? Upper Middle Class Americans are probably their main clientele, but after this ad, I guarantee they are going to lose tons of AMERICAN consumers. And I will be one of them. Absolut-Ly Idiotic advertisement.</p>

			<p>I am not sure who came up with this idea, but if it is the Swedes they need to take a look at their own house first. Perhaps I can run a few advertisements that glorify the Islamic take-over of their country.</p>
<p>Mexico lost a small portion of this land in war, and we purchased the rest in a more than civil manner. </p>

<p>Basically, Absolut says that it&rsquo;s appealing to Mexican fantasies and sensibilities.  This should shut up the &#8220;there&rsquo;s no such thing as reconquista&#8221; crowd.</p>

			<p>No, the new map would not represent an absolut perfect world to the corrupt Mexican nationalists for long. Alas, once everything that was built by the Europeans decayed  &mdash;   the roads, bridges, buildings, sewers,and plumbing, it would be the same old Mexico. Then their envious eyes would, once again, be looking northward. </p>

			<p>   It would be in the interest of all of us, to boycott their products. I will have to double-check to make sure that Glenlevit Scotch is marketed by this parent company. If so, I will BOYCOTT it. Believe me, the minorities don&rsquo;t drink their products. If we boycott them, we can really put a hurt on them. BTW, everybody should be sure to keep up the boycott against Miller Brewery Company for their love of the Mexicans and supporting them against American citizens. It has really slowed them down. I live near the Trenton, Ohio brewery, I know.</p>

Today I sent the following to sarah.bessette@absolut.com. I received an &#8220;Out of Office&#8221; reply   &mdash;   which suggests to me that Ms. Bessette is deluged with hate mail at the moment, and only WISHES she were out of the office   &mdash;   but I urge you to contact her just the same:  </p>
<p><br>
Your &#8220;Absolut Reconquista&#8221; ad is an ATROCITY! I too have had my last shot of Absolut! EVER! And I&rsquo;m NOT KIDDING! I also have a list of ALL other brands under your control, and it&rsquo;s ditto for them, too! <br>
 <br>
What on earth does the company think it has to gain by flattering 100M poor customers in Mexico while severely alienating 300M rich ones in the USA?<br>
 <br>
If I had the Photoshop skillz, I would redraw a map of Europe showing Sweden under MUSLIM control   &mdash;   with the caption &#8220;In an Islamic World&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>If the Absolut people think foreign conquest is funny, perhaps they should consider that Sweden&rsquo;s own brown-skinned malcontents wish to BAN ALCOHOL ALTOGETHER, and given half the chance would saw off the stupid Infidel heads of EVERY ABSOLUT EMPLOYEE! <br>
 <br>
Hey Svend, try this one on for size: &#8220;Absolut Haram!&#8221; <br>
  <br>
Sincerely, <br>
Former Absolut Drinker<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how stupid marketing people can be for sure, but a board voted to accept this ad.  Maybe we&rsquo;re overlooking the obvious since it IS a liquor company!!</p>

			<p>I think Absolut Vodka has made a big mistake. Forget about the &#8220;treason&#8221; to the US, anyone think it is a good idea to have your brand idetified as the drink of Mexico? Mexico is not exactly known for the pure, virgin spring water. Some enterprising competitor Vodka should do adverts showing the sewage water of TJ Mexico and the advert copy would read:</p>
<p>Mexico - don&rsquo;t drink the water and yeah, don&rsquo;t drink the Absolut Vodka made with this Mexican water!</p>

			<p>I have told this story before but maybe for the sake of new readers I&rsquo;ll do it again. Twenty five years ago, in Southern California which I am a native of, a Mexican Cholo type clown came walking into the liquor store I used to buy beer at, that was owned by a really nice old Japanese guy named George. He George was born here in the was 1930&rsquo;s and spent some time in the relocation camps as a kid. Like most Japanese the ill feelings didn&rsquo;t stay with him, but he moved on. Anyway, this cholo goes to the back of the store and removes a couple of beers from the fridge, and walks past George without paying. George, says to the guy, hey! were are you going with that? The guy answers him, this is Mexico, Jorge, all this land your on and everything in this store belongs to me. </p>
<p>Moral of the story? Well, read the above article again, and come to your own conclusions.</p>

<p>Interesting you brought that up.</p>
<p>Miller also managed to anger Catholics last year over the sponsorship of some gay parade, and they are also boycotting them.</p>
<p>It seems like they really don&rsquo;t have any respect for white Americans whatsoever.</p>

			<p>Its times like these that I wish Americans reacted in the same crazy way Muslim countries react. (ex. the Mohammad cartoon riots) Everyone should drive down to the Swedish embassy and drop off their bottles of absolute! If we were crazy Muslims I would suggest throwing them! <br>
This needs to be Widely circulated on the Internet.. <br>
 I would love to see college towns across America throw an &#8220;Absolute end of Absolute Part&#8221;.  They could have a bucket were everyone threw in a few dollars and every time they reached enough to buy a bottle they could make a big show of smashing it! They could do it all night until there inventory is gone. (With the promise of the bar not to purchase anymore Absolute ever!)  <br>
For those of us who don&rsquo;t drink we could take bottle donations and just take them down to the outdoor firing range and use them for target practice.<br>

			<p>Perfect? When most of the people who head across the border are unskilled and uneducated laborers? Making the South West another Mexico would simply mean the same sort of poverty they fled in the first place. It&rsquo;s really no different than when Blacks claim the perfect city is a chocolate one, then all that follows is a crime and a welfare state. In situtions like these, what always happens is they try and escape their own by moving to better white areas, and the whole cycle starts up over again, and as another once nice city or state is destroyed by invaders.</p>

			<p><i>The In An Absolut World advertising campaign invites consumers to visualize a world that appeals to them   &mdash;   one they feel may be more idealized or one that may be a bit &#8220;fantastic.&#8221; As such, the campaign will elicit varying opinions and points of view. We have a variety of executions running in countries worldwide, and each is germane to that country and that population.</i></p>
<p><i>This particular ad, which ran in Mexico, was based upon historical perspectives and was created with a Mexican sensibility.</i></p>
<p>So Absolut&rsquo;s going to run a &#8220;The U.S. without Mexicans&#8221; ad campaign here in the U.S., to appeal to our sensibilities?</p>
<p>Or are we going to create a world of our own, according to our own sensibilities, where we consume vodka produced by a company which doesn&rsquo;t **** us off?</p>

Miller beer is repulsive anyways.                            What about Budweiser?  Are they traitors also?</p>

			<p>I have a knack for saying unpopular things in mob-type situations when everybody pretty much agrees on something.  Then I come along and suggest the opposite.  So this is just food for thought:</p>
<p>National boundaries reflect the supposed limits of control of various governments.  In other words, as it stands now, they are governmental concepts.  That in mind, I think the following question worth serious contemplation: Is the U.S. government really any better than the Mexican government?</p>

			<p>In an Absolut American world, Kosovo is Albanian. I think it follows from that that in an Absolut American World, the southwest is Mexican. After all, the land may belong to the US, but the people belong to Mexico. The analogy is quite direct and I am surprised noone in this thread has commented on it yet. </p>

<p>Speaking as someone who lives relatively close to that institution, the answer is that they have done some half-baked things when it comes to immigration, enough so that if you want to avoid their products, I won&rsquo;t blame you.  But they&rsquo;re not as blatant as Miller.</p>

			<p>Not surprisingly, with a slew of apologies, Absolut pulled the ad on 04/05.  A call to boycott the product by conservative columnist Michelle Malkin, followed by a huge and immediate response, seems to have awoken the Absolut execs from their vodka-induced stupor - or should I say, stupidity?</p>

			<p>Abolut boycott- Agreed!   Absolut-ly never again will I ever purchase anything from that company.   (Thanks for the list, Todd.) </p>
<p>Might be helpful to contact them &amp; let them know why, just so they don&rsquo;t miss the point while they become preoccupied with studies of the adjustments to their marketing they&rsquo;ll have to do as Sweden comes under the power of muslims. </p>
<p>There is a view of that map that I find worth considering: the green zone representing an area of an expanded USA that includes several new territories on the path to statehood- pending the deportation of non-Americans (&#8220;Latino&#8221;, Hispanic, and formerly Mexican) to some point south of the border.</p>
<p>A border which, at a narrower section of &#8220;central&#8221; America, should be much easier to defend. </p>
<p>This would also provide access to the oil fields in the Gulf of America, rather than leaving them to nations whose &#8220;friendliness&#8221; is worse than a bad joke. </p>

			<p>Revisionist history? Mexico never owned California or any border states. Hell Mexico never existed before 1821 the year New Spain won its independence from European Spain and renamed its nation from the valley of mexica. <br>
Spain Mexico Independence War 1810-1821    <br>
<a href="https://www.onwar.com/aced/data/mike/mexico1810b.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.onwar.com/aced/data/mike/mexico1810b.htm</a> </p>
<p>Spain conquered the ex-Asian migrant Aztecs who lived in what is now Mexico 500 yrs ago and renamed them as New Spain for 350 yrs teaching these mongoloid reds white man language Spanish and white mans culture and religion, whose ancestors crossed the Bering Strait and filtered down leaving their tracks as eskimos indians myans aztecs amazons etc.</p>
<p>Aztecs were simply a former mongoloian red race sect from Asia who regrouped in the new lands before being conquered by Spain and taught the white Euro civilization. </p>
<p>These Mexicans were of the same race as the red indians in what is now America but never owned or occupied California or any border state much less the rest of this nation. </p>
<p>Reds yellows and mainly blacks have taken advantage of America and the lenient superior chosen European white race. Never do anyone a favor if you dont want them to stab you in the back. Whites have been stabbed in the back so they reap what they sowed dealing with the inferior races against the natural order of creation.</p>
<p>Race mixing was an abomination to the creator so whites are reaping their punishment. </p>

			<p>I bought a bottle of Absolut a couple of days ago. I just opened it and poured the entire thing down the drain. Weak? Maybe, but I sure feel better.</p>
<p>Posted by idareya at 12:32 AM on April 5 <br>
The owners of Absolut feel better too..they got your money. If you are going to protest in such a way, do it in public, say in front of a TV station, newspaper or maybe your fave Government official.</p>

			<p>Mexico inherited the territory now occupied by California, Texas, Nevada, Utah, and parts of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Wyoming from Spain when it won its independence in 1821. But it had scant settlers in those areas and agreed to let English-speaking settlers from the U.S. settle the area. Texans became unhappy with Mexican government and fought for their independence. President Polk later authorized negotiation with Mexico to forgive the debt owed to Americans from Mexico&rsquo;s War for Independence with Spain ($4.5 million) and an additional $30 million for the territories. This offer was turned down. After the Mexican/American War, the Rio Grande was accepted as the boundary, the debt to Americans was forgiven, and Mexico sold the territory for $15 million to the U.S. There were 8,000 Mexicans living in these 1/2 million square miles of land at that time. Some relocated to Mexico - most remained and became Americans.</p>
<p>In an Absolut World - Alaska would be part of Russia, and the rest of the U.S. would be divided up between France and Britain. But that would probably mean that Mexico would be part of Spain&hellip;</p>

			<p>A storm in a teacup?  But having lived and worked in the USA in the late 1960s (I shared your joy at seeing the first moon-landing)I can understand the patriotism that you (mostly, who is this w  &mdash;    &mdash;  -r Jeremiah Wright?) all possess and I admire you for it.  My kids then aged around 8 and 6 used to swear allegiance to the Stars &amp; Stripes in school each day.  Kids hate being left out of things.   </p>
<p>Please do not let the Marxist-minded amongst you take over, continue being proud to be American so you do not end up like the UK where to even discuss opinions in public could get a stranger ordering you to shut up as you are &#8220;offending them&#8221; (it has happened to me).   I was discussing my experiences in Africa at a classic car-club meeting, after having lived for 25 years in South Africa, with three new friends whom wanted to know when a (white) couple at the other end of the 8-seater table ordered me to shut up. His wife was visibly shaking: what an actress.  He said he was a professor of social studies at some university in Wales (UK).  He was invited to join the conversation but he refused. Just shut up! Of course, as usual, such people have never visited the continent or have only been there on a short holiday.  I have had my revenge though since, he-he-he!  The pen is mightier than the sword.</p>
<p>I left Britain for 24 years (1975 - 1999)and while I was away the left-wing thugs have almost ruined it.  Serves me right I suppose for not being there to help stop their nonsense.  My good wife and I now live in Spain as it is warmer, and the Spanish do not stand for such PC nonsense; only the occasional limey living here.</p>
<p>Incidentally, &#8220;limey&#8221; is not an insult, it is a compliment.  Google it.  Do you know where the term Yank comes from?  In my two years working there, I did not find one American who knew.  Amazing!</p>
<p>I suggest sending many emails to Absolut USA advising that despite the apology, no more will be bought.  They hate sales dropping.  Perhaps they will do an advert. showing Mexico as a new US State to rescue the situation?  After all, Mexico cannot now complain.  Suggest it.</p>
<p>God bless America.</p>

			<p>The American southwest never belonged to Mexico, because Spain never had a legitimate claim to any of it.  When the Mexicans kicked out the Spaniards they inherited nothing, but they did regain their legitimate south of the Rio Grande Mexican territory&hellip; </p>
