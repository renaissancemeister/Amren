<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Wading back into the Democratic presidential race, billionaire businessman Bob Johnson said Monday that Sen. Barack Obama would not be his party&rsquo;s leading candidate if he were white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What I believe Geraldine Ferraro meant is that if you take a freshman senator from Illinois called &lsquo;Jerry Smith&rsquo; and he says I&rsquo;m going to run for president, would he start off with 90 percent of the black vote?&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;And the answer is, probably not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Geraldine Ferraro said it right. The problem is, Geraldine Ferraro is white. This campaign has such a hair-trigger on anything racial .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is almost impossible for anybody to say anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson, who made a fortune after founding Black Entertainment Television and now owns the Charlotte Bobcats, is a longtime friend of Clinton and her husband, the former president.</p>
<p>It was during a January appearance for the New York senator in Columbia that he first stepped into controversy, referring to Obama and &#8220;what he was doing in the neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many took that as a reference to Obama&rsquo;s acknowledged drug use in his youth. But in a statement, Johnson said he&rsquo;d been &#8220;referring to Barack Obama&rsquo;s time spent as a community organizer and nothing else. Any other suggestion is simply irresponsible and incorrect.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I make a joke about Obama doing drugs (and it&rsquo;s) &lsquo;Oh my God, a black man tearing down another black man&rsquo;,&#8221; Johnson said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson disputed the notion that Obama has built a broad coalition. Most of his support, he said, comes from African Americans and white liberals but not white, working-class Democrats.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think he has that common &mdash; what I call &lsquo;I-want-to-go-out-and-have-a-drink-with-you &mdash; touch,&#8221; Johnson said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson said Obama is likely to win the nomination and has had the support of &#8220;the liberal media.&#8221;</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much the point of Obama&rsquo;s candidacy.</p>
<p>Most people in this country are moderates&hellip;.just left or just right of center.  Far left liberal candidates cannot win here.  That is the bottom line when it comes to democratic party politics.  But the liberals in this country have lost their minds to such an extent that they simply will not accept this.  So they are blinding people with the novelty of a first black president and pulling out all the stops to label those who notice his radical politics as racists.  Their big mistake is choosing someone who is a rabid racist themselves.  The whole thing is blowing up in their faces.  Obama&rsquo;s radical politics were the first thing to be outed.  But what has overshadowed that is the extent to which he is completely out of his mind.  Paranoid racist rants in his autobiography.  The most extreme racial hatred, antisemitism, and anti-Americanism and even blasphemy from his spiritual leader.  Associations and deep friendships with hardcore criminals and notorious terrorists.  Disrespect of his own grandmother to try and distract people from the obvious.  Manipulating his mother&rsquo;s horrible suffering and death from cancer to push socialize medicine (which everyone knows would basically eliminate most medical care in this country).  Suggesting to middle America that something is wrong and somehow bitter with being dedicated to Christianity and even worse, suggesting that having guns is wrong too.  To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m looking at Obama and I&rsquo;m VERY glad I and all my neighbors are so heavily armed.  I&rsquo;m not entirely sure Obama and his supporters will accept the fact that he can&rsquo;t win democratically.  The citizenry of this country might find it necessary to prove that a fascist overthrow of our government is impossible.  At the very least, I expect massive rioting in the cities.</p>
<p>Anyway, Obama is an evil totalitarian.  Not figuratively, but literally.  An economic plan of heavy socialism plus a cult of personality based on black nationalism and racism.  Thugs willing to do violence on a large scale to force the adoption of this.  The world has seen this type of thing before.</p>

<p>I think it is safe to say that Obama has taken full advantage of his &#8220;black media privilege.&#8221; And of course blacks tend to vote for blacks. But I still think Johnson and Ferraro are missing something by focusing soley on these two points. </p>
<p>The &#8220;American Civil Religion&#8221; (i.e. people&rsquo;s racial/social/political indoctrination) has turned whites into passive zombies who are totally incapable of thinking critically about race. Which is the real reason why Obama has been able to dodge controversies that probably would of destroyed a white candidate. </p>
<p>The masses are by way of nature and nurture (more nurture than nature I suspect) completely unreceptive to their racial surroundings. Which leaves them easy prey for a gifted black candidate like Obama and his equally talented political team. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;Wading back into the Democratic presidential race, billionaire businessman Bob Johnson said Monday that Sen. Barack Obama would not be his party&rsquo;s leading candidate if he were white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No kidding Comrade Johnson!</p>
<p>The fact is that Comrade Obama&rsquo;s candidacy would be a bad joke if he were white. For all the audacious hoopla he generates among: blacks, media hacks, and those incredibly mixed up affluent white people who stopped living and became diversity zombies, he is mostly a nonentity. Moreover, his campaign is nothing more than a series of platitudes that revolve around the buzzwords &ldquo;change&rdquo; and &ldquo;hope;&rdquo; he stands for nothing more than promoting Marxist social schemes and &ldquo;revitalizing&rdquo; the racial spoils system in the name of &ldquo;racial healing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this is what he offers as a candidate, just imagine what his &ldquo;presidency&rdquo; will be like?</p>

<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>OK, if &ldquo;worse is better,&rdquo; what happens if we elect Obama?</p>
<p>The fear I have is that we lose our freedom of speech. Sites such as this one, talk radio, etc. are either made to shut down or saddled with endless regulations that smother them. Hate speech laws are more strongly enforced. If Obama falls and no one is around to hear it has he really fallen? The MSM will endlessly regurgitate propaganda. How do you state the truth when you have been silenced?</p>

			<p> Bob Johnson is no fool, and only he, being black, could point out the obvious. Geraldine Ferraro got the boot for saying the same thing.  I would like to think that Ferraro&rsquo;s dismissal was a wakeup call for gender feminists, but I suspect it is a call that they did not care to answer. </p>

			<p>If Obama and his socialists come looking for a fight, they will get more than they can handle.  </p>
<p>After a few days of riots they will either be too tired to fight on or bled dry.</p>

<p>You are a PROPHET without knowing it.  The coming black riots will make Watts look like a Sunday stroll in the Park.  These coming riots by blacks will forever change the paradign in the US and maybe even the world.  The pity of it is that many thousands of white people in the nation&rsquo;s large cities will die by black rioters.  This is as SURE as the rising sun when Obama &#8216;Messiah&rsquo; is elected.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s certainly true.  Unfortunately the white working class has no one at all to vote for in this election   &mdash;   as usual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that in America a man can become a billionaire for creating Black Entertainment Television yet if I tried to create White Entertainment Television I&rsquo;d be a pariah, my business would fail because no one would dare advertize on it, and I might well find myself accused of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;.<br>

			<p>Johnson is really in Obamas corner like all blacks. He just came out publically early in support of Clinton so he has to stick with it to keep from looking wishy washy plus he was given a brand new 400 million NBA custom built arena to play in after they ran the white guy Shinn and his Hornets NBA team out of town because he was an easy target and was white. <br>
Whites are easy targets today for other whites trying to make it look like they arent racist or pro white and will support a black owner. Weird psychology but true.<br>
