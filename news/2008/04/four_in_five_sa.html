						<p>Immigration is diluting our culture and leading to the breakdown of society, according to the vast majority of Britons.</p>
<p>83 per cent told pollsters the country had a &#8220;population crisis&#8221;.</p>
<p>Strikingly, this view was held by 58 per cent of settled migrants and their British-born children.</p>
<p>Most of those interviewed felt that special treatment for newcomers was causing locals to &#8220;lose out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same views were shared across the social classes.</p>
<p>The survey for Immigration: The Inconvenient Truth, an investigation by Channel 4&rsquo;s Dispatches, was carried out by YouGov.</p>
<p>It found that 15 per cent of Britons would halt immigration altogether and 84 per cent would reduce it. 63 per cent of settled Commonwealth immigrants agreed with them.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of those polled believe that migrant workers are undercutting native workers and taking their jobs. Immigration is also considered by the British to be the biggest factor behind societal breakdown over the past decade.</p>
<p>Some 58 per cent think the nation&rsquo;s cultural fabric is being &#8220;damaged and diluted&#8221; by immigration.</p>
<p>Last night, the Government&rsquo;s critics said the case for a cap on migrant numbers &mdash; a move resisted by Gordon Brown &mdash; was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Damian Green, Tory immigration spokesman, said: &#8220;We have been saying for some years now that the rate of net immigration should be substantially lower.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s why we called for an explicit annual limit &mdash; and without that the Government will continue to have a crisis on their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, a pressure group, said: &#8220;This is stunning confirmation that the public want to see firm and effective action to reduce the scale of immigration. It is a view shared by two-thirds of previous immigrants.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;The Government cannot remain in denial much longer.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>The findings on community relations will be equally alarming for ministers who are finally moving away from the doctrine of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Only 25 per cent of those polled said immigration had led to a rich and varied culture in Britain &mdash; compared with 58 per cent who said it had not.</p>
<p>69 per cent of Britons said multiculturalism was not working as did 45 per cent of settled migrants and 41 per cent of new arrivals.</p>
<p>A third of the latter group agreed with the statement that immigration is making Britain a more dangerous place to live.</p>
<p>Three out of ten Britons claim they &#8220;never&#8221; or &#8220;very rarely&#8221; interact with people from ethnic minorities. However, 77 per cent of the recent migrants interviewed said they felt they are generally treated fairly by British society.</p>
<p>Half of migrants who have moved here since 2000 said they had no intention of becoming a UK citizen. Meanwhile, 51 per cent of Britons said they had considered moving to another country. Among city- dwellers, this figure rose to 75 per cent.</p>
<p>The survey&rsquo;s findings end a damaging week for the Government. On Tuesday, an authoritative parliamentary report concluded that migrants bring little or no economic benefit.</p>
<p>The report by the Lords Economic Affairs Committee demolished many of the Government&rsquo;s arguments for immigration, describing the key claim that they boost the economy by Â£ 6billion a year as misleading and irrelevant.</p>
<p>Claims that immigrants are needed to fill vacancies and defuse the so- called pensions time bomb&rsquo; were also dismissed.</p>
<p>Responding to the survey, Liam Byrne, the Immigration Minister, said: &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been saying for two years that immigration is top of the list of voters&rsquo; concerns. The British public want to see change to the immigration system and the Government has got the message.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why 2008 sees the biggest shake-up to immigration and border security in 45 years including a points system like the one in Australia, a new unified border force and compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals.&#8221;<br>

<p>O.K&hellip;that&rsquo;s a good start, but first the Brits must stop holding out that big carrot hanging at the end of a stick called WELFARE benefits that &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221; or parasitic immigrants seem to gravitate to like bees to pollen.</p>
<p>Remember this ($60,000 per year) story:</p>

			<p>&#8220;The British public want to see change to the immigration system and the Government has got the message.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like Juan, &#8216;I can&rsquo;t wait to give them all amnesty&rsquo;, McCain got the message? Like illegal alien advocates Clinton and Obama &#8216;get the message&rsquo;? Meh. If either of our governments &#8216;got the message&rsquo;, they would have shut down all immigration, canceled every visa, and deported every alien years ago. Just lip service. Empty talk. Can&rsquo;t believe a word they say because there is never any action backing up their words. Speaking of lip service, where o where is that fence? When will the Bush administration prosecute its first case of a criminal employer hiring illegal aliens? Waiting, waiting&hellip;</p>

			<p>At least the Brits are wising up &hellip;.too bad our white liberals don&rsquo;t get it yet&hellip;but they will&hellip;and it will be one of the hardest lessons they ever learned&hellip;&hellip;but it will also be too late for us!</p>

			<p>But will the British government listen? I doubt it. When I visited London a few years ago, I couldn&rsquo;t believe how many women I saw clad in Islamic headgear - it was more reminiscent of Iran than jolly old England! Even if the British government listens to the people and bans further third world immigration, it may be a case of too little too late.</p>

			<p>If so many Brits agree on the negative effect of immigration, they need to take to the streets and start firing en masse their leaders. Nothing else will stop these leftists creeps.</p>

			<p>Interesting that native Britons seem to be developing a voice. The same cannot be said for Canada. There is no open debate on immigration in this country. ANY discussion on lowering the immigration of non assimilable minorities in Canada is met with the usual cries of &#8220;racism&hellip;ect&#8221; and is therefore shut down. If you question the insane immigration policies of the goverment (regardless of political party affiliation) you might even be required to appear before one of Canada&rsquo;s quasi-judicial Stalinist Human Rights Commisions, which have a 100 percent  &#8220;conviction&#8221; rate.</p>

			<p>With the slightest downturn in the US economy, White Americans will start start rising up against seeing their tax dollars being used for alien welfare, which in turn will see an increase in immigration to the UK, and which will in turn lead to the final destruction of the UK. It&rsquo;s too late for Britain to offer any meaningful resistance.</p>
<p>Make sense?? Think about it - and factor into the equation that the US government has already stated that it cannot finance the UNations any longer. </p>

			<p>There is a definite growth in the willingness to speak out and vehement anger over what has happened in the past 10 years. Liam Bryne is telling fibs again, there will be no change to Labour&rsquo;s open door policy. That said the housing market has started to crash and the subsequent recession has begun. These evil Labour clowns will be out in 2 years and won&rsquo;t get back in for many many years. Immigration, housing nad the economy are the three daggers into the heart of the Labour vampires.<br>
The reason I have never worried is ultimately British people still have a great pride in race and nation. We have always been an insular and xenophobic people, its in our genes.</p>

Being stabbed has a way of waking up people from denial.  Increasingly, this is the way Brits are learning that multiculturalism is a lie.</p>

			<p>For the first time, I heard a program today on the BBC that actually highlighted the quesiton of white farmers in Zimbabwae, but the racial aspect of it was played down, even by the white farmers that were interviewed, still in Zim and still on their farms after the police intervened and chased off the &#8220;government&#8221; thugs that tried to evict them.</p>
<p>Regardless this is a sign, along with this report and others, that England is beginning to revolt against this suicidal government policy at last.</p>

			<p>The difference between the UK and the US and Canada is that the UK has a serious nationalist political party that actually contests elections.  Because of this, the media establishment there needs to address concerns about about immigration regularly.  </p>
<p>Here in north America, people can&rsquo;t vote for change no matter how mad they get.  </p>

			<p>Diamed, I voted BNP for the last six years, and yes they are right in what they say. But there are unanswered questions relating to the behaviour of two of the higher ups, there is no accountability with the hard earned money of members reportedly being blown on Croatian villas etc. If the BNP is to have any credibility with the British electorate then it will have to clean its act up. This time I&rsquo;m voting for the National Democrats - same principals, no baggage and all above board. Wise up Diamed, and if you&rsquo;re a BNP member then ask where your money&rsquo;s going mate.</p>

			<p>  It doesn&rsquo;t matter that 4/5&rsquo;s of Brits are against immigration. It&rsquo;s what the government and media think that will win out.</p>
