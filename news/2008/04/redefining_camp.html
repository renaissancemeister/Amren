						<p>Across America, the nation&rsquo;s select colleges are expanding their concept of diversity. It&rsquo;s not just about improving racial and ethnic balance on campus, but also increasing the percentage of low-income students &mdash; which is even lower than for minorities. Both are important goals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opening the university gates to make it possible for more low-income students to attend still means shutting out otherwise qualified students. But voters perceive discrimination based on income as more acceptable than racial preferences. And there are no legal hurdles.</p>
<p>Attuned, selective colleges and universities are making a greater effort to improve income mix and still keep an eye on racial diversity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last fall, 19 of the country&rsquo;s largest public university systems pledged to halve the achievement gap for minority and low-income students by improving their college attendance and graduation rates.</p>
<p>And the nation now has a proven model in Texas, which has found a legal way to increase income, geographic, and racial variety &mdash; and academic performance. The University of Texas guarantees admission to the top 10 percent of state high schools. It sweeps rural and urban schools, poor and wealthy, minorities and whites. (The above-mentioned lawsuit challenges the part of admissions that still uses racial preferences).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 2003 study by the Century Foundation found that African-Americans and Hispanics each constitute only 6 percent of incoming freshmen at the nation&rsquo;s 146 most select schools (as defined by the Barron&rsquo;s guide). Yet the percent of blacks and Hispanics among 18-year-olds is more than twice that. Income disparity was even worse: only 3 percent of all the freshmen were from the poorest quarter of the population.</p>

			<p>The achievement gap? Those who can acheive have acheived, are achieving or will achieve. Those who cannot achieve will continue to complain and will continue to be &#8216;carried&rsquo; by the achievers.</p>

<p>Just what our universities need more poor blacks on campus to make the graduation rate for blacks even lower.</p>

			<p>Rural sweeps and urban schools? lol. How about a single &#8216;White United Students&rsquo; organization, at any college anywhere in the nation, to join the thousands of non-white student organizations that colleges are so proud to boast about and sponsor? From Howard U to Boise State, most universities have dozens of these groups on campus, all devoted to people of color. Those obsessed with &#8216;diversity&rsquo; should make an effort to actually have some. </p>

White students (smart ones and the average students) will be pushed out&hellip;.we will be a nation of illeterate imbiciles in the next few years if the liberal communists have their way.  Bye the way&hellip;.they teach such trash at most colleges, some students drop out because they know their profesers are nut cases!!!!!</p>

			<p>A thinly veiled attempt to continue their racist preference system.  Instead of saying they gave an undeserved position to a person of color, while shutting out a better qualified white, they will say they gave it to a poor person.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t work.  They can expect to be severely punished for trying to get around the law.</p>

			<p>The fact is that many conservatives are resentful of middle and upper class Blacks and Latinos who are as financially successful as they are; thus they feel more comfortable with lower income Blacks and Latinos who are more likely to be academically deficient and make many conservative bigoted Whites feel perversely good about themselves.</p>
<p>It diminishes the high level of insecurity they (White bigoted conservatives)have about themselves.  </p>

<i>&#8220;A thinly veiled attempt to continue their racist preference system.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Exactly. Just a different method of &#8216;cooking the books&rsquo;, so to speak.</p>
<p>You can put anyone in college and give them a diploma, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they earned it or deserved it. More devaluation of our education system that comes with &#8216;die-versity&rsquo;. <br>

			<p>Though affirmative action sounds acceptable in theory, it is not what the liberal-racists want.  For poor whites score better on admission tests than rich Blacks.  If scholarships are given to the poor who deserve them, who are able to pass college courses, most would go to poor whites.  The elite-racists do not want to help poor whites.  They demand that the help go to colored minorities.  And if their crowd in admission offices chooses, they will not choose the highest and most intelligent, because they want a quota of lesser qualified minorities.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -HM</p>

			<p>I think that the Black Thug class should get to go to all of the Ivy League and other so called elite schools for nothing.The sooner they completely wreck these bastions of self righteous stupidity and juvenile perfidity the better. Perhaps real scholars like Paul Roberts and Jared Taylor could set up private academies with a strong online presence-so that real scholarship could be advanced and the present academic depravity entirely superseded. It could be called &#8220;reparations&#8221; and the repubican girly men would fall all over each other to make it happen so as not to be called &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The modern American university has adopted its operational model straight out of the Wizard of Oz: by simply handing a piece of paper to the dullard scarecrow, he immediately becomes a genius.  Just so with the blacks - hand them the dimplomas, and they immediately step straight into law school, med school, or $80,000-per-year salaried fedjobs ahead of all the White suckers who will all be waving flags this 4th of July.  </p>

<p>1.) We are going to take your tax dollars and spend them on foreign students who will go back to their countries of origin and either work with their governments to build organizations capable of innovating next generation products to compete directly with American businesses or seek to become insourced white collar labor displacing American white collar workers. </p>
<p>and also;</p>
<p>2.) We are going to take your tax dollars and spend them on black and latino and asian students to compete directly against you for your job. You will have to pay for your own education and theirs as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bottom line. All here who approve say yeah please: *cricket* *cricket* *cricket* and all who oppose this counter productive policy say neah please: NEAH!!!!!!!!</p>

			<p>One of two results is likely here: either these academically-unqualified students will flunk out in droves after their freshman year, or the universities will have to dumb-down their curriculae in order that the diversitoids can pass the classes.  This will lower the value of diplomas from these schools.</p>
