<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The Absolut vodka company apologized Saturday for an ad campaign depicting the southwestern U.S. as part of Mexico amid angry calls for a boycott by U.S. consumers.</p>
<p>The campaign, which promotes ideal scenarios under the slogan &#8220;In an Absolut World,&#8221; showed a 1830s-era map when Mexico included California, Texas and other southwestern states. Mexico still resents losing that territory in the 1848 Mexican-American War and the fight for Texas independence.</p>
<p>But the ads, which ran only in Mexico and have since ended, came as the United States builds up its border security amid an emotional debate over illegal immigration from their southern neighbor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In no way was it meant to offend or disparage, nor does it advocate an altering of borders, nor does it lend support to any anti-American sentiment, nor does it reflect immigration issues,&#8221; Absolut said in a statement left on its consumer inquiry phone line.</p>
<p>Some fringe U.S. groups also claim the land is rightfully part of Mexico, while extreme immigration foes argue parts of the U.S. already are being overtaken by Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Absolut said the ad was designed for a Mexican audience and intended to recall &#8220;a time which the population of Mexico might feel was more ideal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a global company, we recognize that people in different parts of the world may lend different perspectives or interpret our ads in a different way than was intended in that market, and for that we apologize.&#8221;</p>

To the Reconquista Absolutists: You are NOT forgiven. </p>
<p>My boycott of your brand and every other brand under your control   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m already carrying the list in my wallet   &mdash;   will continue FOREVER. </p>
<p>You need to be taught a lesson. You need to be made an example of. You need to be PUNISHED. </p>
<p>If I could, I&rsquo;d force every one of you smarty-pants Swedes to live in my old mestizo-infested neighborhood of East LA. Then you&rsquo;d understand that handing over the Southwestern United States to ineducable, unassimilable Third World dullards is NO LAUGHING MATTER. <br>

			<p>&#8220;Mexico still resents losing that territory in the 1848 Mexican-American War and the fight for Texas independence.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the territory sold to the US by Mexico via the treaty of 1848 was still part of Mexico, it would, today, be inundated with tar paper shacks with tin roofs and raw sewage running down the streets, just as it is in so many Mexican areas, and its inhabitants would be sneaking across the US border to find work.</p>
<p>Mexicans want the world to believe that the land in question is really all they ever needed to be prosperous and that that opportunity was taken away from them by the US.</p>
<p>But it is not the land the Mexicans really want in the Southwest.  They want what the Gringo built on the land, which is a first world civilization of significant prosperity.  Their land to the south is a cess pool.  Are we supposed to believe the Southwest US would be any different than the rest of Mexico if the Mexicans retained it?</p>
<p>Too, if it is only land they want, and it is only extra land they need to be prosperous, then why haven&rsquo;t they developed the literally thousands of square miles of uninhabited terrain just south of the US/Mexico border?  The terrain on both sides of the border is exactly the same.  The US side was not a land of milk and honey that guaranteed success to its owners in and of itself.  What difference would it make if Mexico owned thousands of square miles of scrub and desert north of the border, since the same kind of terrain has been available to them for their entire existence, yet it lies vacant and unused except for dilapidated hovels and trash dumps here and there?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that Mexicans don&rsquo;t need land for prosperity, and they wouldn&rsquo;t be prosperous if they owned more of it.  They have a poor country because their people have poor abilities and can&rsquo;t build anything on a similar level on their own.  It is our prosperous society the Mexicans really want calling it, &#8220;their land.&#8221;  They can&rsquo;t build the same, so they&rsquo;re seeking to have what we have by attempting to steal part of our country.</p>
<p>And, do you know what?  I&rsquo;m really getting sick of hearing their whining lies, just as I&rsquo;m sick of listening to black whining a la Jeremiah Wright.</p>
<p>Neither group can make it on their own and it literally enrages them to stand by and watch whites excel while they fail.  </p>
<p>Therein lies the basis for their contentiousness:  Envy and jealousy has evolved into hatred.  It has absolutely nothing to do with land, slavery, oppression, white racism, or any one of their numerous pitiful whining complaints.</p>
<p>I just wish they told the truth during their next protest march and carried signs that said, &#8220;We&rsquo;re envious of you and we&rsquo;re jealous of you, because we can&rsquo;t compete!  That&rsquo;s why we hate you so much.&#8221;  And more signs should say, &#8220;Illegitimate whining is our ploy to try to get what we can&rsquo;t achieve on our own!&#8221;</p>
<p>If they did that, I&rsquo;d respect them a lot more. </p>

			<p>When one views the map/ad in question that was allegedly  targeted solely at the market within Mexico, why does the text of the hook read &#8220;In an Absolut World&#8221; instead of &#8220;En Un Mundo Absolut&#8221;?</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t aiming too well at their &#8220;target market&#8221;. Or maybe they&rsquo;re lying about trying to be cute and &#8220;edgey&#8221; and having it backfire on them.</p>

			<p>In an Absolut world, Mexico lost the war of 1848 with the United States because it was the weaker of the two countries, absolutely. Had Mexico been strong enough to retain its territory, it would be just as poor as the remainder of Mexico, and your citizens would be swimming the Red River to get to Oklahoma.  You lost. Get over it. As for me, I prefer good old US-produced bourbon whiskey. When I do drink vodka, it will never again be Absolut.</p>

			<p>As a global company, Absolut will have to get used to the fact that a lot of US citizens will no longer consume its product due to its insulting anti-US ad. Keep your vodka in Scandanavia   &mdash;   I can suggest where you might put it  &mdash; , and let the Mexicans stay in Mexico.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Absolut said the ad was designed for a Mexican audience and intended to recall &ldquo;a time which the population of Mexico might feel was more ideal.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Absolut still refuses to acknowledge that their ad seemed to encourage modern Mexican claims of longtime U.S. territory as rightfully Mexican.  They pretend to be ignorant of the tensions that exist today between Mexico and the U.S.  They pretend to be ignorant of the political parties operating in the U.S. that offically claim this territory is Mexican.  They pretend to be igorant of Mexican presidents that have been circumventing the U.S. Federal Government by making political visits to states and opening schools on U.S. soil for Mexicans with Mexican government funds with curriculums designed in Mexico.  They really did no investigation when they considered this ad campaign?  I wonder if they advertise in Albania too?</p>
<p>Boycott Absolut Forever!</p>

<p>Well bully for Absolut and their utterly fantastic marketing campaign for a targeted &ldquo;Mexican audience.&rdquo; And doubleplus bully, for their utterly worthless and prevaricating &ldquo;apology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They picked their side in the Aztlan/La Raza question, and more or less admit this when, in their so-called apology, they note that the map was &ldquo;intended to recall &lsquo;a time which the population of Mexico might feel was more ideal.&rsquo;&rdquo; Well, maybe the Mexicans of 1848 should have thought of that before they started their war against us, and maybe Absolut rotgut company should have thought with equal forbearance in 2008 on the topic, before they insulted their main sales market with this anti-American add?</p>

			<p>I used to buy Absolut, and enjoyed it. I will not regret never buying another bottle. These companies (foreign and domestic) must learn that there are repurcussions for such idiotic, racist ad campaigns. I wonder who the idiot was who agreed to the ad that obviously insulted and alienated the company&rsquo;s main consumer demographic? They could have an award for &#8220;dumbest company killing act by an executive&#8221; named after them.</p>

			<p>Lol&hellip;.Absolut will be damn lucky if some competitor doesn&rsquo;t start aggressively stealing their market share by prominently displaying their sick ads and simply putting forth the message &#8220;we love America&#8221;&hellip;..not like those bastards at Absolut.</p>
<p>I know, if I owned a company that produced vodka, I&rsquo;d run, not walk, to my ad department to exploit the situation for millions and millions of dollars profit.</p>

			<p>These large companies have some awareness of where things at this moment in time are headed and they attempt to use mass psychology for their own purposes.  They&rsquo;re familiar with &#8216;La Raza&rsquo; and these other Hispanic organizations and they&rsquo;re familiar with what their designs on us are.  They also want Mexicans to associate empowerment with their vodka; in other words &#8216;Drink Absolut and take back the territory that those evil White devils stole from you 160 years ago.  They&rsquo;re also familiar with the fact that Mexicans drink A LOT.  I don&rsquo;t think however that Mexicans can be persuaded to go the Absolut route.  I think they&rsquo;ll stick with their &#8216;Corona&rsquo; and Tequila. I think Vodka is out of their league.  But the company doesn&rsquo;t care what they have to do to sell their product, even if it means &#8216;selling-out&rsquo; us.</p>

			<p>I am an occasional drinker. After reading about the Absolut company blatantly advertized their product in Mexico with the Mexican map encompassing the south west United States, I will certainly not buy any beverages produced by Absolut. The apology will not suffice. I do not believe their apology was sincere; they are merely saying sorry not because they feel guilty, but because they don&rsquo;t want to lose potential sales.</p>

			<p>I wonder if Jews would boycott Absolute if they ran an ad directed towards neo-Nazis in Germany that featured a map of the world with a Swastika over all the territories Germany originally conquered in World War II, followed by &#8216;In an Absolute world?<br>
Obviously.</p>
<p>There are countless analogies&hellip;</p>
<p>Would the countries that were former colonies of the British, including the US boycott if Absolute ran an ad in Britain that had their flag over their former colonies?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we would be nearly as upset because the British are not a current threat to us, Mexico is, I that is what creates so much animosity against their ad.</p>
<p>I was only attempting to analyze this topic objectively above, but yes I think the ad is a disgrace and I truly support a boycott of Absolute.<br>

			<p>Oh yeah, we&rsquo;re really going to show them. We&rsquo;re going to punish that Absolut company. Hey wait a minute, isn&rsquo;t that what all the people were saying about John McCain when he coauthored that amnesty bill? We&rsquo;re going to punish him, he won&rsquo;t get elected to anything and now he&rsquo;s the Republican nominee.<br>
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the people who write in and respond to these articles say interesting and intertaining things but we also need to be saying the same things to friends, coworkers, on talk radio and in letters to the newspaper if we want to have an affect.<br>

			<p>The title should say &#8220;Swedish Government apologizes&hellip;&#8221;  Since that was who owned Absolut when the ad campaign was approved.  Since partially sold off (probably with &#8220;golden shares&#8221; as EU governments can&rsquo;t seem to take their hands off of private enterprise.)</p>

The ad is outrageous. <br>
I don&rsquo;t know who is responsible or who really owns Absolut at present. I saw an article in the financial news just recently (wish I had it in front of me now!) that Absolut had been sold off to a large (and presumably) &#8220;French&#8221; liquor conglomerate, very largely for the purpose of obtaining its impressive access to the American market. Now, that may all change. I hope so. Absolut was overpriced anyway. Buy Danska and help the Danes.</p>

			<p>You know, in a liquor emporium nowadays, a lot of things can happen to store stock (such as those bottles of Absolut on the shelf) that just might render them unsaleable. If I was a liquor store owner, I would play it safe and drop all Absolut products, just to avoid the headaches they might generate for me. Stoli is a lot better than that greasy motor oil anyway. </p>

			<p>I see a lot of wishful thinking here, but the marketing truth is that any publicity is generally good publicity.  Many more people will hear about Absolut for the first time and will be curious about this daring company rather than will want to clear it out of their liquor cabinets. It&rsquo;s not pretty, but that&rsquo;s the way the market works. </p>

			<p>Just as the Gays boycotted Coors back in the (?) 1970&rsquo;s, all whites should literally walk into every nearby liquor store, and say, &#8220;We will not patronize your shop, until you remove Absolut from your shelves, and KEEEP IT OFF.&#8221;</p>
<p>If they will not listen, then pickets saying &#8220;This Liquor store is Anti-American&#8221; will get the message across.</p>
<p>DO NOT let this drop!</p>

			<p><i>My boycott of your brand and every other brand under your control  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m already carrying the list in my wallet  &mdash;  will continue FOREVER.  </i></p>
<p>You need to be taught a lesson. You need to be made an example of. You need to be PUNISHED. <br>
Querty<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
If I could just add one further point:  They need to be made to understand WHY this is happening, in order to get the lesson across.  Otherwise, the message is lost.</p>
