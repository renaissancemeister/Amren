<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Anthony Cataldo of Oakland first raised concerns about aggressive bullying at his son&rsquo;s elementary school last year after Zachary lost four teeth on the playground &mdash; but he said he received only a verbal assurance that things would change.</p>
<p>Cataldo said he complained again when some boys at school kicked 7-year-old Zachary in the stomach three months ago but got no response.</p>
<p>Now &mdash; two days after an older student slammed Zachary against a tree, fracturing his skull and sending the first-grader to intensive care &mdash; Cataldo is hiring a lawyer, and school officials are paying attention.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State records show that Piedmont Avenue Elementary is Oakland&rsquo;s second-most-violent elementary school, recording 97 suspensions last year for violence &mdash; including nine involving a weapon.</p>
<p>That level of danger is higher than at most middle and high schools in the district as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It happened after school as Zachary waited for a ride. As he tells it, &#8220;a fifth-grader picked me up, and he body-slammed me into a tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A girl who witnessed the attack said it was unprovoked, Cataldo said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zachary was clammy and lethargic. [Zachary&rsquo;s after-school caregiver, Arhonda Morris] put him in her truck and picked up Cataldo. At the hospital, Zachary began vomiting. A CT scan revealed a skull fracture, so doctors whisked him into intensive care, hoping to avoid surgery.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His father said that in kindergarten last year, Zachary was on the playground when some fifth-graders who had been sent out of class for disciplinary reasons approached him and lifted him up.</p>
<p>&#8220;One was spinning Zachary around,&#8221; Cataldo said. Then he let go.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I got reassurance from his principal that nothing like this would happen again,&#8221; Cataldo said. But three months ago, &#8220;he was kicked in the stomach by an older kid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said he has also seen unsupervised youngsters running around wildly in the morning before school when he has dropped off Zachary a few minutes early.</p>
<p>Saddler [Denise Saddler, an Oakland Unified School District administrator in charge of elementary schools in North and West Oakland] confirmed that elementary students across the district are often unsupervised unless they are enrolled in before- or after-school programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cataldo, meanwhile, said he was stunned to learn that Piedmont Avenue&rsquo;s suspensions for violence last year were among the highest of the district&rsquo;s 59 elementary schools. Only Preparatory Literary Academy in West Oakland, with 106, had more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just find that astounding, because we&rsquo;re talking about elementary kids up to the age of 11,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s scary, is what it is.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I know that many people who are cursed with living in an area where their kids have to go to a mostly black school cannot afford to move elsewhere, but someway&hellip;.somehow&hellip;they should attempt the impossible and get their kids away from those black students any way possible.</p>
<p>Certainly, at a minimum, parents should initiate law suits against the district for failing to protect their kids.  </p>
<p>It seems that whites don&rsquo;t go the courts much even when they have winnable cases.  With the situation becoming worse, they had better start doing it or their children will suffer even more.</p>

			<p>Until non-blacks learn the power of non-violent protest and marches, the vast and oppressive black on non-black (and especially against whites) will continue.  I gave up church a long time ago because my pastor or any other don&rsquo;t have the guts and sense of justice to march in defense of whites who are brutally injured and maimed by racist black african violent hatemongering children.  I&rsquo;d love to see this school boycotted, withdrawal of the non-black population, and permanent expulsion of the black racist aggressor.</p>

			<p>Sorry, this isn&rsquo;t ordinary school bullying.  This is racial hate.  I think a lot of the politically correct talk about &#8220;bullying&#8221; is to confound the issue away from what it really is.</p>

			<p>any white person who has ever been to a school or existed in any environment where the ratio is as described above can tell you that bullying,harrasment and violent attacks are just par for the course.<br>
   Any parent who places a white child in such an environment should automatically know that they are placing thier child&rsquo;s life in jeapordy.</p>

			<p>Poor kid, he had to pay a pretty high price for parents who did not see what was going on and remove him from this holding pen for delinquents. The school administrators obviously did not want a racial incident and did nothing to protect this poor boy from kids who may have been as much as twice his size. Given black propensity to repeat grades they could have been as old at 12-13 and in the 5th grade. If there are one or two black students in a class they can be controlled, once there are about 10-15 percent black there will start to be problems, when there is a majority, forget it classes as such will be worthless and any teaching will be an exercize in containment. </p>

			<p>Generally whites behave in a manner that&rsquo;s pleasing enough to blacks. There&rsquo;s no need for most of the incidences to go to the level of critical injury or broken bones. At 9 years of age or so these blacks may be too young to understand that. </p>

			<p>What kind of a father does this poor kid have?Doesnt he even know what the racial makeup of this school is?Or doesnt he know what blacks are, or how they typically behave? Oakland is at least 35% white, but the school district is less than 5% white, which means most of the whites send their kids out of the city, or to private schools.And that school is in one of the better, if you can believe it,parts of Oakland.Some of the schools in Oakland are so bad that even some of the black parents send their kids out of town.</p>

			<p>I suspect that when Whites say they can&rsquo;t afford to move to a White area, they usually mean that they can&rsquo;t pay for White housing AND their favored luxuries.  I can see enduring a nearby ghetto or bario if you are an adult.  Perhaps your diverse neighborhood has amenities you value that are not available elsewhere.  But no White parent has any business placing their kids in that situation.  Even if you have to give up your stockbroker job and drive a truck, even if you have to give up your aerospace machinist job and fix farm tractors, you owe your children a White upbringing.  </p>

			<p>If this was a white on black incident, we would have another Jenna on our hands.  Since this happened in the godless state of California, this father no longer has the option of home schooling his child thanks to some liberal judge.  I am sure this judge never had to send their child to school under these conditions.  Last, but not least, not only do white children go to school and get beat up, legislature has been passed to teach them about gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender relationships.  They will be taught that these relationships are &#8220;normal&#8221;.  I am sure there are very few &#8220;normal&#8221; people left in California, and the state government is doing its best to indoctrinate them.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure this is a daily occurence to countless White kids because of their P/C blinded parents wanting their kids to have a &#8220;diverse&#8221; upbringing. This school is 71% black and this father didn&rsquo;t know there were going to be problems? And his son had several beatings before this and he STILL didn&rsquo;t put 2 and 2 together? I think if you look up dumb a- - you&rsquo;d see this fathers picture there! I would drive 2hrs each way to work to keep my kids from this. The only good part is that I know that this is how alot of realists are made!!</p>

			<p>Using the term &#8220;bullying&#8221; is a manipulation to cover up what this really is&hellip;.felonious assault.  Prison, not expulsion is the necessary punishment.</p>

			<p>This is typical Black behavior and it starts at the age of 2! They are ten times more racist against Whites than visa versa! Whites need to wake up to this fact and act accordingly. Our race has become so dumbed down and so pathetic, I am almost ashamed of most of them. Especially the leftists and the neo-cons aren&rsquo;t far behind!</p>

			<p>The father definitely should be suing the school district but, as pointed out, he is also negligent because he allowed his son to attend a majority black school.  How can you send a sheep to live with the wolves and expect the sheep to be safe?  I, personally, had a choice not long ago: raise my teenage son in a ghetto area with a high black/Hispanic population or forfeit my house to foreclosure.  I chose the latter, destroying any good credit I had and losing thousands of dollars (and many many hours of hard work)I&rsquo;d invested in that house.  We must have our priorities right and our children must come first.</p>

			<p>Wherever there are black kids,there will be chaos,baiting, misunderstanding.Last night at Sears in Uniontown,PA., I had o go to the rest-room.To get there, one had to pass the Sears Portrait Shop   &mdash;  full of black kids(one family most likely).Sat down,and the RR filled with black kids (including little girls), laughing like maniacs and hitting stuff in theRR.And complaining about the&#8221;STINK&#8221;&#8220;.Not one went to the bathroom.Guess they came in to harass me. I was using a cane to walk.Guess it made me look weak.Guess I was lucky there were no gang-baning teens.W.M.</p>

			<p>My girlfriend is one of those.  She has announced, with considerable pride, that her son will be attending a mostly black high school in Portland next year.  I just smiled and said it&rsquo;ll be an interesting experience for him.  He&rsquo;s a budding grafitti artist, so I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll fit right in.</p>

			<p>I would get my kid out of a majority black school even if he or she had to go to a private school where the kids use cardboard boxes as desks so that they would be safe. If you cannot home school and cannot afford an expensive private school this might be your only option. Forget about being able to transfer out of that district without moving. You will be told something like &#8220;it is contrary to integration policy&#8221; basically that is a way of keeping white students in a majority black school district stuck there. White kids have to endure getting beat up, abused, raped and mistreated to prove to the rest of the nation that a district has &#8220;full integration&#8221; Kids do not learn anything when they are in constant fear of being assaulted by thugs! It is unfortunate that there is the compulsory attendance law so that these criminals in training cannot be thrown out.</p>

			<p>Speaking from a Los Angeles perspective, white kids in black neighborhoods are systematically turned into &#8220;wiggers&#8221; who must then &#8220;put in work&#8221; (e.g. perform) to show they are &#8220;down for their set&#8221;. </p>
<p>You cannot judge them too harshly; however, as their is no other recourse for them if they wish to survive in those neighborhoods. Any attempt to show white pride will result in severe violence upon their person and maybe death. Demographically, very few whites live in black areas to be honest. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s black gangsterism ideology and propaganda that has injured most young whites here, safe in their suburban enclaves and middle class neighborhoods, who fell for that lie believing it somehow made them men. There&rsquo;s the tragedy really. </p>
<p>But for sheer destruction of our culture and nation here in LA, nothing even comes close to the latino invasion that has occurred since my grandfather&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>Oh boy&hellip;well, aside from the fact that it makes me sick to my stomach to hear about a boy going through that - in fact, it makes me want to reach through the computer and pop out the other side ready to come to this boys rescue - there is NO hope for ANY white who is outnumbered like that EXCEPT to get him the hell out of there.</p>
<p>Who here doubts that the students who are guilty of this depravity are getting encouragement from their parents. Probably the only kind of encouragement they get.  Personally, if you can sue cigarette companies for getting cancer you should be able to sue the MSM, both Print and TV, and Hollywood, for encouraging non-Whites to attack Whites.  </p>
<p>The ONLY thing that will change is force.</p>
<p>Long story short; years ago a non-White entered the place where I worked following a woman who was dropping off a package.  She was frieghtened by the guy who was obviously drunk, not crazy, just drunk (there had been a big ethnic parade in town hours earlier) and also young and big. Two co-workers and I escorted him out of the building, he lunged toward me in a threatening manner and I dropped him.  One of the two co-workers, a black man from the Virgin Islands; he told me, &#8220;you didn&rsquo;t finish him.  That&rsquo;s the ONLy thing he will understand.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I never forgot that.  He was right.  The two police were, like this man, Hispanic; one of them asked me for my address (obviously to give to the guy I belted).  It took me two years after that incident but I got out of that city and have never returned.  Shortly after I left the country for good and will never come back. The reason is, I know me, and sooner or later, I would have blown my stack.  I was outnumbered like this boy.  My heartbroke when I read this article. Lets say a prayer for him that his Dad gets him out.</p>

			<p>This is just unbelievable to me.<br>
I went to Oakland schools as a kid.  My parents were liberals, so I suffered constant bullying much like poor little Zach here.  No playing around pushing and shoving- real beatings that involved the emergency room.  Like poor Zach, my parents just kept sending me back to the school to receive another beating.  Of course, I was lectured by both parents and school staff about how I needed to learn to &#8220;embrace diversity&#8221;.  Yes, it was my fault.</p>
<p>Finally, my parents had enough and sent me to a different school- that school was Piedmont.  I haven&rsquo;t been to Oakland for years (and I never desire to go back there) but what happened?  Piedmont was really, really upscale.  That WAS the only Oakland school for the white kids.</p>

			<p>Fracturing the skull of a seven year old child is not &#8220;bullying&#8221; by any stretch of the imagination. It is brutal assault. Whites are only 8% (just one in twelve) of the kids at this school. IT IS 71% BLACK!!! No way would any kid (or nephew/niece) of mine EVER attend a school like that. I would do whatever I had to do to ensure my kid was not there.</p>

			<p>The victim doesn&rsquo;t appear to have a mother and his dad is struggling to raise his son by himself.  The father works for Safeway and is at the low end of the pay scale.  The Bay Area is extremely expensive to live in and the dad is apparently struggling as it is. So moving is out of the question. After the first &amp; second battery of his son,the dad did try to get his son transfered to another school, but the principal refused. Seems she likes to see white little boys beat up and bullied by some thug that is 4 to 5 years older.  While the little victim is in the hospital, the bully remains in school and is probably continuing his dirty deeds with the blessings of the racist principal on his side.</p>

It makes me sick that whites all over this country can&rsquo;t stand up for their own race, hell, many won&rsquo;t stand up for their own children.  Diversity is for masochistic morons.   It is white liberal traitors who have brought us to this ridiculous situation where the founding majority of this nation is being hounded and pushed out of the cities we built.  A situation where the majority population has areas of every major and mid size city that are now NO GO areas, where taking wrong turn can cost you your life.  </p>
<p>How long are we going to keep pretending that the latest victim of black hate was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Increasingly the wrong place and time is to be white in the United States in the early 21st century.  Wake up white America, there is no place to go.  Time to start pushing back.</p>

Total brain washing going on at Martin Luther King Jr.Middle School.  I was convinced it was my fault.  I used to get beat down with the other six students that were white on a regular basis.  When we moved to Maine talk about a change for the better.</p>

			<p>I went to Malcolm X elementary school in Berkeley, CA (on the Oakland border) 30 years ago.  I&rsquo;m white and that school was 90% black.  This is nothing new&hellip; as is the standard government response which is to do absolutely nothing.  I just ran away from that hellhole in junior high school when the violence became really dangerous.</p>
<p>Govt. hacks are afraid of blacks because blacks riot and vote en masse against any politician who crosses them.  So what white liberals do is sacrifice their own children to the gods of black racism in order to keep themselves safe.  That&rsquo;s why my mother gets no cards from me on Mothers Day.  She was more interested in proving to her peers that she wasn&rsquo;t racist than keeping me from getting robbed and beat by black kids on a weekly basis.  She destroyed our whole family just to get shallow praise from people who couldn&rsquo;t care less if we lived or died.</p>

			<p>Give the father a break people. It sounds like he is raising this child on his own (which is admirable, well, for a male). Maybe he is not the sharpest knife in the drawer but he is trying to do the right thing. It also sounds like he may not have much money (notice the child care lady picked the father up on her way to the hospital, which implies maybe he does not have a car).</p>

<p>You are exactly, exactly right about blacks who riot, rant, threaten, and &#8220;vote en masse&#8221;. And about the cringing white politicians who live in fear of them.  However  most white liberals more typically sacrifice OTHER people&rsquo;s children to the Great  God of Diversity.  How sad that your mother was such a fanatic that she sacrificed her own!  Well that&rsquo;s the Bay Area, isn&rsquo;t it?  Close to Berkeley and all that.   Nuff said.</p>

The year is 1956.  The place is Thomas Edison Junior High School, Cleveland Ohio.   Fifteen minutes before school ends the white boys are let out early.  They race down the street to catch the bus.  If they miss the bus they will get beat up by the black kids.</p>
<p>MLK brought on a lot of changers, but one thing stays constant, blacks will still beat up white kids if given the chance. <br>

			<p>A federal judge has partially released the McComb Mississippi School District from a desegregation order, saying that while the school district appears racially unified, a policy that creates all-black classes as a result of lumping white students into home rooms must be changed.  <br>
School officials had been clustering white students into classrooms at Otken and Kennedy elementary schools in what they said was an effort to prevent white students from feeling isolated and to curb white flight.<br>
But U.S. District Judge Tom S. Lee, in his order issued April 18, said the district could have done more to accomplish those goals without leading to &ldquo;racial isolation for a significant number of the District&rsquo;s black children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there were no white children left in these schools and all the classrooms were all black, the schools would be hypothetically perfectly integrated. But the level of segregation would be palpable  &mdash;  the black city schools, the white private and suburban schools,&rdquo; Lee wrote.</p>

			<p>Here is a letter I wrote to Nanette Asimov, author of the above very predictably-written story:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to imagine how you would have written this story if the school had been all-white and the victim a little black boy.  The story in that case would have read nothing like the one you wrote.  You would have written about a series of vicious, focused racial attacks that Zachary had to endure in the midst of an uncaring power structure, and blamed whites for their personal and institutional brutality.  But you chose not to write it like that.  Because the racial &#8220;narrative&#8221; was not to your liking, you called it a case of schoolyard &#8220;bullying&#8221; - as if Zachary had been shoved and his baseball cap knocked off his head.  Your phrase &#8220;lost four teeth on the playground&#8221; assigns it the unseriousness and blamelessness of a lost contact lens.</p>
<p>And running through your entire story are deliberately avertive, racially laundered phrases like &#8220;some boys&#8221;, &#8220;an older student&#8221;, &#8220;a fifth grader&#8221;, &#8220;an older boy&#8221;, &#8220;some fifth graders&#8221;, &#8220;an older kid&#8221;, &#8220;unsupervised youngsters&#8221;, &#8220;elementary students&#8221;.   The only underlying causes or reasons you allow in this narrative are that it&rsquo;s just a statistically violent school that can&rsquo;t afford to do the job that parents should be doing in &#8220;supervising their&#8221; children before and after class so that &#8220;older kids&#8221; don&rsquo;t prey on them.  You go on and on.  So very predictably, over and over - the journalistic equivalent of whistling and twiddling your thumbs.  None of which you would have done if the races had been reversed.</p>
<p>Ms. Asimov, this school is what is it - but you have a choice, and you have chosen to ignore and evade the personal and institutional racial nature of the violence in this story, thereby tolerating an environment in which it flourishes.  And by doing so, not once, but over and over, as part of a deliberate policy of your newspaper, and of the mainstream media in general, in thousands of &#8220;incidents&#8221; like this all over the country over many decades - you and your journalistic cohorts are in a definite sense abettors and accomplices to this racial violence. </p>

			<p>What is lost in this article is that in black majority schools there is a core of kids two and three years older than the long suffering white kids. After being held back at least two years, you have 13 and 14 year old kids, sometimes 6 ft. tall and 200 pounds terrorizing not only the smaller kids but the teachers as well.<br>
     I have been involved in 5 law suits against the schools for injuries kids suffered at the hands of thugs on campus. A lot of the assailants were on suspension but the jury never heard this because the court said it was privilidged.<br>
     If you think elementary schools are bad, nothing compares to middle school. In one of our middle schools every principal in the last ten years has been assaulted by a student or parent to the extent they needed hospitalization. Get your kids out of these schools and home school them. I know two families that meet at the cemetary where their kids are buried. The school board got restrainning orders against them from visiting the school on the date of their kids`s murders. The school board said it was disruptive since they were killed 100 yards off school property by a gang of black students who may or may not have been in that school; and that it wasn`t the responsibilty of the school to keep order after school was let out.<br>

School solution to successful bathroom run? Break up white contingents into smaller groups in different classrooms. Parents were told to watch their comments and have the kids try to get along.

			<p>I was steadily bullied until age 14, when I always brought a weapon to a fight, usually three feet of heavy chain.  By 15, I wasn&rsquo;t shy about doing terrible things while unarmed.  One guy got two severe beatings, once after throwing a rock at my girlfriend.  I held the front of his shirt in my left hand, and beat his face with my right until I was tired.  He started out screaming obscenities at us, but when I was done, he was just screaming.  He kept his mouth going later, so I adopted an &#8220;attack on sight&#8221; policy with him.  I throat-punched him during our second ancounter, because I saw him first, coming around a corner.  He went right down.  </p>
<p>I hope Zachary eventually figures out that it is impossible to be a bully without also being a coward.  I learned that when I wa 14, the last time my father beat my mother up.  My sister and I were watcing TV when he hit her, and I called the police.  I then put my sister on the phone and waited at the bottom of the stairs with a machete.  He backed down and waited for the cops.  A year later, my mother filed for divorce after he beat me and she then saw me stalking him with a baseball bat.  She figured someone was going to get killed.</p>
<p>As insulting as I can be, I believe nobody should be physically mistreated.  I will never raise a hand to my wife or our daughter, or another honest man.  </p>
<p>What I did, I think, was rewire my old fear of physical violence into hate and anger.  It isn&rsquo;t what I wanted.  I used to be a coward, and now I&rsquo;m the opposite, but the motivation is the same.</p>
<p>Poor Zachary!  He&rsquo;ll probably end up with a violent felony conviction, when he deserves better.</p>

			<p>I hate to agree with you but this kid is headed for a violent felony conviction. Schools will do nothing to keep a kid from getting beaten, picked on or otherwise abused so the only thing that a kid can do is lash out when he is tired of the abuse. So many kids are told to just ignore abuse and it will go away. This is like being told to ignore the elephant in the living room and he will eventually disappear. Not a chance. This poor dad seems to be doing all he can do, if only there were a way to set up a scholarship fund for this poor little boy so that he does not have to go to this horrible school any longer. There is a snowball&rsquo;s chance in h@ll that he will be allowed to transfer out of the Oakland district. </p>

<p>Because it costs $10,000 a year (At least at the Catholic high schools in the San Francisco Bay area). We can say what we want about &#8220;getting Zach out of there,&#8221; but th reality is that if Dad is in a low-income job, and these Catholic/Liberal schools want the money up front (as they always do), they&rsquo;re both screwed. </p>
<p>And also, I wrote &#8220;Catholic/Liberal&#8221; for a reason. The outright brainwashing in my kid&rsquo;s Catholic high school is nothing like I&rsquo;ve ever <i>seen</i> before. And I went to a classified military school where they taught us how to recognize it. The Catholic schools are as bad a the old Soviet Union.  </p>

			<p>I also have a story about the &#8220;joys of diversity and integration&#8221; when it was being slammed down our throats like bad medicine in the 70&rsquo;s due to busing. I was a third grader, going to school in the idyllic Midwest (at least back then it was). It was in the morning, shortly before the bell rang to start the offical school day. All of the boys (all White) were playing dodgeball in a softball field against a softball backstop that was part of school property. Five new black male &#8220;students&#8221; got off of a school bus (they were being bused to OUR school) and started walking right toward us. Once they got to us, one of them demanded to be given the ball by the White kid who was holding it. The White kid didn&rsquo;t and then the black kid just started hitting him in the face. The White kid seemed to be in a state of shock as normal human beings don&rsquo;t behave the way this black kid was behaving. So, he didn&rsquo;t know how to react, so he didn&rsquo;t. Anyway, the bell rang and we all went inside. The black kids were shuckin&rsquo; and jawin&rsquo;, noddingly approving of their own anti-social behavior.</p>
<p>The next day, the exact same thing was about to happen. Another White kid had the ball and when I saw the black kids walking toward us again I said &#8220;give me the ball&#8221;. He was more than happy to. I stood there with my arms crossed and the ball in between them. The same black kid now said to me &#8220;give me the ball&#8221;. I said &#8220;you want the ball?&#8221; and via a chest-pass, slammed it hard into his face. He fell down from the strong and unexpected impact. As soon as he got up and came toward me, I met his face with a right cross, dropping him again. The bell rang, and we all went inside. This time, the other White boys were slapping me on my back&hellip;smiling, laughing, and in good spirits. That was the last time any of the black boys would do anything like that again for the next four years until we all advanced to Middle School. Unfortunately, for the White boy that endured the beating the previous day, he never fully recovered his confidence and became a very quiet person up and through high school.</p>
<p>I know this is a much different scenario than poor Zachary has had to face with a vast majority of black male students, most of them in a grade level that reflects their intelligence level not their age level. Unfortunately, this means that they will also be 2-3 years older than poor Zachary (or any other White or Asian child), 50lbs heavier and a half-foot taller.</p>
<p>Hang in there Zach and keep your head up once this is all over with. I hope this story was inspirational in at least some way.</p>

<p>Also, more and more vapid, fat, flacid and lazy whites will wake up when white children are beaten to death. The Jews needed the gas chamber to wake up and DEMAND  a homeland. We will need the same.</p>

			<p>The more I read and re-read this story, the more the melancholy truth behind these atrocities is exposed  and the most  terrible results of these acts erupts from my memory.<br>
     The kids  turn into cowering dog like people who have lost the joy of life. They withdraw into a world of fantasy and fear that resembles kids at Bergen Belsen. They even start to identify with their abusers and start abusing younger weaker kids.<br>
     The parents become docile and instead of having homicidal felings against the perpetrators and the school, engage in psycho-babble about troubled kids and over-taxed officials.<br>
     The hardest part of representing these victims is to teach them that getting mad dog mean and having atavistic feelings for revenge and justice is a good thing and not anti-American or politically incorrect.<br>
     You would think that these folks would be fertile fodder for those wanting to radicalize them for the fight for cultural sanity; however the devastation of their souls is so great that they are like herd animals that accept predation as a way of life.<br>
     I lost most of these cases; however it was worth it to the victims because the expierence taught them that even if they beat you down again and again, they haven`t won if you get up one more time, this time with concealed weapons permit and the determination to not allow further attacks under any circumstances. They learn that when the law isn`t enforced to protect your kids there is always the glorius choice of taking it into your own hands and how these feelings are as American as apple pie.<br>

Throwing kids off bridges for sick pleasure.<br>
All that television and cable entertainment proclaiming freedom of expression using images of gang rape, interacial sex, gang mayhem, low budget horror, and the fashion trends stemming from this has made Hollywood and corporate America rich and proud.<br>
While kids lose their souls waiting for the day they can exact revenge on kids who also live without conscience addicted to a box of lies called corporate television.<br>

			<p>Did anyone see the news piece this morning about the seven year old who took off with his grandmother&rsquo;s SUV and caused quite a bit of damage to property as well as the vehicle itself. They interview the little bastard and he arrogantly stated that he did it because he liked to do things that were bad. He neither looked not spoke like a seven year old. He was dressed in the typical Afro-American gangsta&rsquo; attire.  There was no sign of the fear and shame that one would expect of any normal kid after a lesser act of mischief. The grandmother who is in charge of his care (there&rsquo;s another shocking disclosure) said that she would like to beat his butt or something of equal profundity.</p>
<p>I tried unsuccessfully to find the video on the web. The story was posted in a way that makes the kid sound like a cute little scamp.<br>
 In about five years we&rsquo;ll be hearing about him again.</p>

<p>And once it <i>does</i> take hold, stand by! The results are usually far out of proportion to any one of the endured incidents. Think of the battered wife who shoots her abusive husband <i>twenty-two times</i>, with a single shot .22 rifle.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, if I were a commander of a militia unit made up of such long-suffering White individuals, I&rsquo;d have one set of rules of engagement: <i>Anything Goes</i>. The results of that order, while stunning in its purity of purpose, would be so horrifying that I&rsquo;ll be surprised if this post gets published for fear of seeming to advocate such a position.</p>

			<p>My heart goes out to this poor precious child.  I&rsquo;m FURIOUS that a parent would actually send their child to this type of a school.  I went to a middle/lower class school, and the older black kids were ALWAYS picking on the singular, younger white kids.  There were blacks in 5th grade constantly picking on the white first graders. </p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s why my mother gets no cards from me on Mothers Day. She was more interested in proving to her peers that she wasn&rsquo;t racist than keeping me from getting robbed and beat by black kids on a weekly basis. She destroyed our whole family just to get shallow praise from people who couldn&rsquo;t care less if we lived or died.</p>

<p>We had the same background AvgDude, except with me it was on the East Coast.  My mother and I made peace just before she passed.  She was not sick when we spoke, but I think confessions are extrememly powerful and they come with a strong emotional and psychological reaction and that is why people don&rsquo;t like to admit they are wrong most of the time. Dostoyevsky said that the only way to rejoin humanity was to confess. My mother died less than a week after her very stirring and convincing confession. She acknowledged that she was wrong all of those years and her epiphany came in the form of a broken heart when she realized what she had done to her boy, and how her neglect lead to the kind of abuse the boy in this article has suffered.  <br>
For anyone who tries to dismiss this stuff with &#8220;get over it&#8221; and &#8220;move on&#8221; only reveals how shallow and ignorant they are of the facts.  As Nietzsche once said, in so many words, when you confront a lie that has been in place for a long time and it deeply rooted, there will be convulsions and explosions.  We are living in an age when certain lies are being exposed and those who are defending them are not going to go quietly in the night.  I survived, barely, and am glad that others here, Michael C. Scott, AvgDude, myself, and many others here, have made it to the other side.  Badly damaged perhaps, but Survivors.  We have a story to tell and if the rest of the world won&rsquo;t listen we should listen to each other. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The victim doesn&rsquo;t appear to have a mother and his dad is struggling to raise his son by himself. The father works for Safeway and is at the low end of the pay scale. The Bay Area is extremely expensive to live in and the dad is apparently struggling as it is. So moving is out of the question. After the first &amp; second battery of his son,the dad did try to get his son transfered to another school, but the principal refused. Seems she likes to see white little boys beat up and bullied by some thug that is 4 to 5 years older. While the little victim is in the hospital, the bully remains in school and is probably continuing his dirty deeds with the blessings of the racist principal on his side.</p>

			<p>Catholic K-8 schools are much cheaper than the high schools, and the instruction is pretty routine, no elaborate Red propaganda.  When your kids finish 8th grade, don&rsquo;t enroll them in the local public schools.  Ship them to a relative, or just use a friend&rsquo;s address to get them into a better district.  Or just pull them out of school and teach them yourself.  The local schools don&rsquo;t know about them since they&rsquo;ve been in Catholic schools.  Let the kid know what fate awaits him if he comes to the attention of the authorities.  Somehow, hide him until he&rsquo;s 16.  During WW2, people concealed themselves all over Europe, waiting for the Allies.  It can be done in the USSA too.  We owe it to our children.  </p>

			<p>I taught for a year in California public schools. With 35 kids in a classroom and one half of them not speaking English there is nothing you can do. Your entire time is trying to get through<br>
the hour without a fight breaking out. Try asking a student to sit down or do the assignment and then realize that the blank stare is because they simply dont speak English. Try assigning<br>
a 9th grade level assignment and then learn that Juan and Juanita ages 16 have the academic skills of a 2nd grader, which is where their schooling stopped when they left Mexico. As for the black kids, there was something going on there so frightening that it defies description. Kids sent to school with drugs to sell in order to make money for the parent. Kids who are literally jumping out of their seats every 2 minutes because their impulse control is so low. Kids (is that the word?) whose entire vision of future is to be a gangsta. Pregnant 16 year olds girls. And you cannot talk to them or reason with them&hellip;all you get is a empty stare that is beyond reach. DONT SEND YOUR KIDS TO PUBLIC SCHOOL&hellip;EVER.</p>

<p>Good for you!</p>
<p>See, there you go.  I have been posting here for a year or so and that is the second time I have seen a post where a person is willing to take action and help in some way.  I am NOT saying that it&rsquo;s only the second time it&rsquo;s happened here, just that it&rsquo;s only the second time I have seen it.</p>
<p>It would be great to get some contact info from this family so we could at least offer emotional support, if not more.</p>
<p>We most DEFINITELY have to network.  Someone mentioned an AR article on building alliances, so I looked it up and read it.  Good article, but while reading it I realized that we still have to form one - with OURSELVES!  I think the Powers That Be will do everything to keep whites from organizing into a self-conscious movement. They have been pretty successful and we&rsquo;ve done all we can to help them.  And this is with us still the majority.  Can you imagine what will happen when we&rsquo;re the minority?  Anhilation, no doubt.</p>
<p>One good thing though. All of the alliances that are formed against us are not strong either. They have money, they are united against us, but that seems to be their only organizing principle. They are so single-minded about it that they can&rsquo;t see two things&hellip;</p>
<p>1- they are burning their candle from both ends</p>
<p>2- thanks to the Internet they and their motives, etc are totally exposed.  They can&rsquo;t hide behind the old excuses.</p>
<p>This, plus the economy, immigration, the War in the Middle East, could very well work in our favor. Time will tell.  But by that I mean, within the next year or two. Certainly after the election.</p>

<p>Excellent point, Mr. Tiffany.</p>
<p>The ONLY thing these low g-loaded thugs understand is immediate, harsh, physical punishment meted out without prejudice.  They do not, and never will understand being told &#8216;don&rsquo;t do that again or else&rsquo; as school administrators are wont to say.  I also believe that many non-White/Asian school administrators, as the principal above, are all to happy to see a White (child or not) receive a beating. Why else would this principal not put an immediate stop to the attacks against this poor little child? I hope the principal loses her job as surely a White principal would after the race hustlers, the MSM and anti-White politicians were through with him (that is, if the races were reversed).</p>
<p>We must teach our White children some form of defense, preferably armed if possible, self-defense (as in martial arts) if in a situation where arms are not possible.  They must also be taught explicitly that self-defense is a Civil Right.  If anything, they will learn not to attack again.</p>
<p>As to those parents described above by AveDude and others  &mdash;  is it not the primary role of a parent to see that no harm comes to his child?  What kind of parent willingly sacrifices his child on the altar of multiculturalism?  </p>
<p>As a parent, I don&rsquo;t get it.  As Dr. Laura says:  Such parents should have their parenting cards torn up and burned. As for me, I&rsquo;d wish them a much harsher fate for destroying little children  &mdash;  or allowing them to be destroyed just so they (the parent) can appear to be less-racist-than-thou. Sickening.</p>

Is there no recourse to the police here?   A crime is a crime!  This isn&rsquo;t &#8220;bullying&#8221; or a mere matter of school discipline, for god&rsquo;s sake! This is the commission of a crime.<br>
Forget about going to the principal (who will do nothing), and go to the police to swear out a formal complaint. If the police won&rsquo;t take it, see a laywer! This is where you enlist the law on your side, not the school principal, who&rsquo;s obviously  prejudiced and useless.</p>

Chas.Tiffany<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
My God!    I knew it was bad out there, but I didn&rsquo;t know it was <i>THAT </i> bad. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I was  in school.  I am not naive about our national decline; but reading all these posted stories is still a revelation to me.  I never realized how fortunate I was when I went to school. That was another, more civilized era, when America had standards. It must be a nightmare for children now.</p>
<p>I went to a  public school, an all white school in an all white area, before the era of integration and  forced bussing began.  It was an EXCELLENT school, with beautiful grounds, outstanding teachers,  strict discipline, very high academic standards, never any fights or (heaven forbid!) any crimes. School guards were unknown and police were NEVER seen there. (There was no cause for them.) Striking a teacher was inconceivable. Metal detectors and searches were unimaginable. There was no dope around (drugs were literally unheard of).  We had middle class children as well as children from some very wealthy families. (One was the son of a senator; another the son of an admiral.)   There  was no need for us to go to any private schools, back then, because this school was every bit as good. (There was no one to get away from!) We received an  <i>excellent </i> education    &mdash;   which only now  I can fully appreciate. </p>
<p>Reading these accounts makes me realize how far we, as a nation,  have fallen!  This is the result of integration and the well-meant liberal daydream of raising the mud above the fish by government fiat.  I didn&rsquo;t happen!  The mud remained at the bottom, as was predictable.  And they only dragged the fish down into the mud too.   Try as you might, you can&rsquo;t turn sow&rsquo;s ears into silk purses by legislation.  </p>
<p>Inevitably, this degradation of the educational experience has carried over into the workplace too. And to <i>ALL </i> other aspects of American life.  It is only obvious that we cannot sustain our leading position in the world if we go on like this.  America itself is slowly being sacrificed at the unholy altar of racial equality by those who are obsessed with it, and in the meantime we are all being dragged down to the level of the lowest common denominator.</p>

			<p>This story should be posted EVERYWHERE.  I have already posted it on youtube and lots and lots of websites with my own comments attached.  My comment generally goes like this;</p>
<p>There is NO reason for ANY White person to feel they owe ANYTHING to this country as long as this goes on.  The Power Elite and their Pets might not care about us but we do. They might not even want us to care about ourselves, but we do. One predictable consequence of this bizarre cult of victimization has been that the abuse of REAL victims are marginalized or ignored while the phoney victims are enabled and induldged with a twisted, strange, unhealthy, and unbelievable, sentimentality that is really cynicism when you pull off the mask.</p>
<p>A good example is found in the other article featured at AR now about how &#8220;Casanova Love&#8221; felt scared when he saw a noose; and so now a young man might have to go to jail as a result.  Meanwhile the school where this poor, dear, innocent White child of 7 years, is brushed aside by his School System and by the MSM.  These people are depraved. They have a sensitivity chip missing and so, for this reason, I say that NO White person with a lick of sense should show ANY loyalty to this country as long as it is run by these Gangsters.  What else would you call them?</p>
<p>Today, The United States of America is run by Gangsters.</p>

<p>In a normal world, he would receive a huge settlement and be able to afford any school he wanted - but will the court system just be more of the same?</p>
<p>His aunt wanted him to attend school with his cousins - a good solution for a single father, her brother. The school her kids attend has a student/teacher ratio of 24/1, only 3% black, and NO incidents of violence. Piedmont has a student/teacher ratio of 18/1! Chabot Elementary, her kids&rsquo; school, is full. </p>
<p>It is hard to imagine this other universe kind-of experience when the all-white schools and neighborhoods we grew up in were so entirely different. </p>
<p>What is so horrible about Civil Rights and Affirmative Action is that Blacks have been exposed. They actually ARE inferior and violent. The excuse that they were &#8220;being held back and not given equal opportunity&#8221; has been shown to be a lie. Now that knowledge has gone main-stream, sunk deep into our conciousness AND theirs! Political Correctness is just the dying throes of that excuse.

			<p>Blacks are just a violent race. Period. They show this every day in a thousand different ways. Their racial hatred of Whites adds fuel to the fire but even in all-black areas rates of violence and crime are extremely high. Indeed the most likely indicator of crime in a given area is to measure how large the black population is. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve noticed there is more crime and violence in Detroit then in Fargo? Jamaica, South Africa, Rwanda, indeed any black area will invariably have above average, never below average, levels of violence.</p>

<p>Yep. The ONLY thing standing in our way is - Organization.</p>
<p>As we have seen from Ruby Ridge, Waco, etc. they will do ANYTHING, sneaky, under-handed, ignoble, back-stabbing, etc. to make sure NO White organization gets together beyond a little conference or two here and there.  Unless of course you it&rsquo;s the ADL, SPLC, ACLU, or AIPAC, etc. then, you get get together as often as you look and spend all the money you want to do everything in your considerable power to bring the country to its knees and make it do your bidding.  If there&rsquo;s any resistance, crush it immediately and then blame your victim.</p>
<p>These Michael are the REAL Thugs, and EVERYONE knows it.</p>

Perhaps. But I&rsquo;d guess it was just as likely that  <b>Howard&rsquo;s mother  </b>was the fundamental problem; and her social/political views were merely a manifestation of same.</p>

			<p>To AvgDude,</p>
<p>You are a brave and heroic brother.  I am sorry that you were robbed of your youth by someone who should have been your greatest protector - your mother.  I hope you can forgive her and I hope she can find it in her heart to apologize for her great sin.  And I wish the filthy (and many are dead) white trash politicians - those genocidal Bolshevik and Bushevik types - will burn in hell for the genocide they have created.  I have nothing for them but my spit.</p>

<p>So right!  You can write, preach and babble all you want, and they will allow it   &mdash;   even ENCOURAGE it   &mdash;   so long as you&rsquo;re just letting off steam harmlessly    &mdash;   but try to organize, and that&rsquo;s when the iron fist will come down&hellip;. at least if you organize well and threaten to become successful.   On the other hand if you bungle it and make fools of yourselves, that&rsquo;s perfectly fine, since it relieves them of the bother of having to destroy you. They&rsquo;ll let you destroy yourselves while they sit back and laugh at the spectacle.</p>

<p>In other words, a ditzy wacko just like Obama&rsquo;s mama.</p>
<p>And it must carry back still further in families.  As Awakened pointed out in a recent post, Obama&rsquo;s mama was named &#8220;Stanley&#8221; by her parents.  There&rsquo;s something basically screwed up there.</p>
<p>And furthermore, what kind of wacky grandparents would take in and raise the mulatto product of their daughter&rsquo;s foolishness, while she ran off with ANOTHER colored man to have still more children by him?  Yes, something is deeply screwed up in these families.</p>

			<p>An acquaintance of mine is currently walking across the U.S. in some kind of  &#8220;diversity walk&#8221;, or &#8220;native american walk&#8221;  &mdash;  organized by some group, to celebrate and call attention to some multiculti something or other.</p>
<p>She beams positive energy in her multiculti enthusiasms, and I&rsquo;m sure regards me as hopelessly mired in negativity with my concerns such as the victim in the story above.</p>
<p>This attitude on the part of the multicultis burns me up and fills me with negative feelings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beating around the edges of something important here. People like to feel good. Being full of the concerns I am now doesn&rsquo;t make me feel very good. And I don&rsquo;t notice that other posters here or on other white sites seem to be brimming over with happiness either. Understandably.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the 60s when I was a radical lefty and overage hippie, I felt good. And the multicultis I know today feel pretty good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unable to take these thoughts further  &mdash;  I hope someone else can. I think there&rsquo;s something important in all this, that relates to our low ability to attract converts.</p>

			<p>Here in Berkeley, Ca. there have been quite a few newspaper articles in recent years about school &#8220;bullying.&#8221; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another false category, like &#8220;racism.&#8221; And probably another opportunity for funded programs that don&rsquo;t address the real problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black thuggery&#8221;  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s the category that screams for admission into common thought and parlance.</p>

<p>The lefties like think they have a monopoly on truth, justice, and wisdom.  They think they KNOW better and ARE better than everyone else. And they like to flaunt it. That makes them feel very good. I should know: I was once there too.  Looking back, a lot of the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; activity was really about feeling good (about one&rsquo;s self).  It still is!  The current fad for sponsoring &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, pushing equality, and fighting &#8220;racism&#8221; is largely abuout feeling vitrtuous,  demonstrating one&rsquo;s liberalism,  and competing to show off who is &#8216;holier than thou&#8221;.   </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what else to add, but I think Dumpty is really onto something there.  Instead of always complaining, we need to find a way to &#8220;feel good&#8221;.</p>
