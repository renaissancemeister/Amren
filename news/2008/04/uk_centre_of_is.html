						<p>Britain has emerged as the focal point of Islamist terror in Europe, according to Europol, the European police force.</p>
<p>A report on terrorism by Europol has claimed that the UK reported a 30 per cent increase in arrest of terror suspects last year.</p>
<p>Out of 203 persons arrested in 2007 in the UK, a majority were related to Islamist terrorism. In contrast, 201 were detained in the rest of Europe. French police made 91 arrests.</p>
<p>The number of suspects under investigation in Britain has risen from 500 in 2004 to 2,000 last year.</p>
<p>What is worrying is that the number of arrests involved young, radicalised British muslims, sparking fears that the threat of an attack is growing.</p>
<p>The terrorist plots also linked to groups in Pakistan. The report comes following disclosure last week that 15 plots to attack British targets have been foiled in three years since the London bombings in which 56 people died and over 700 were injured.</p>
<p>At the time of their arrest, all Islamist terrorism suspects were between 17 and 72 years of age. The average age was 35 years, with two-thirds of the arrested being between 23 and 43 years of age.<br>

			<p>So tell us something we don&rsquo;t know! Melanie Phillips pointed this out in her book Londonistan some years ago.I only hope that when the next bomb goes off it does so within close proximity of those Islamic appeasers and vile reptiles in the British parliament that have turned my country into a third world ghetto and have allowed London to become Londonistan. </p>

			<p>People who do not know England must be cognizant of the facts, for their own safety - in particular I address this post to any American who happens to have the slightest attachment to the intelligence and security forces who happens to be reading this.<br>
  At least 20% of all births in England today are of muslims (mostly Pakistanis).Mohammed is the most popular baby boy&rsquo;s name in England.This percentage will only increase in the future.<br>
  A very high proportion of British-born Pakistanis are radical Islamist sympathizers.Even if only 1% were, this equates to an enormous number of individuals.They are very, very well organized and fanatical.<br>
Americans, for your own safety, you *MUST* treat England with same suspicion as you treat Syria, Pakistan, Iran, Lebanon etc.<br>
  This is no exagerration to frighten you, but the most earnest warning.</p>

<p>Depressing and true. And while political pressure is necessary to end it, I don&rsquo;t think politics alone will save us. Politicians can never be relied upon for anything so crucial. They&rsquo;ve all sold themselves out to the enemy, anyway.</p>
<p>A more personal route we&rsquo;re going to have to take. Let go - just a little - of our political concerns and start doing the only things we can do, personally, to stop it. Have more kids. Teach them the Western culture that they should be proud of.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t demand that anyone else have more children, but we, all of us, instead of having the one or two kids we were gunna have, need to have 4 or 5. If that means living in a somewhat poorer (and blacker or browner or more Muslim) neighborhood, then so be it. For once let us be the ones taking over their neighborhoods. Fear has no place anymore in this world. </p>
<p>It is time to add personal action to the political kind. And the great thing about personal action is that it gives you some sense of control, a satisfaction that you are fighting back in your own way - and winning.</p>

			<p>I note that this article is from the <i>India Times</i>. If anyone has the Muslims&rsquo; number, it&rsquo;s the Indians. Get a history book from pre-PC times and read about the Delhi Sultanate. Will Durant&rsquo;s <i>Our Oriental Heritage</i> gives a good overview.</p>

<p>You are so right there Mr.Digby. But it&rsquo;s not just in England, I believe these people are building enormous networks of schools, societies, mosques and cultural centres in every major city in the West, it&rsquo;s all above board and in the open, after all they&rsquo;re just expressing their culture and diversity, nothing to worry us infidels!. When their numbers are sufficient they will be able to make demands for special treatment, Sharia law, Islamic State Schools, Islamic regions etc. knowing they have an infrastructure to back them up. This is what has happened in Britain; they have anticipated every complaint from their Infidel hosts and are very well prepared in order to counter complaint any perceived injustice.  Even more problematic is the likelihood that they will most certainly have an underground network too, and then of course there are the Islamic terrorist networks, like the Islamabad military training regions in the US. It&rsquo;s all very worrying because their religious growth is synchronous with our religious decline. e.g. less than 5% of Britons attend church regularly, fortunately the US is much stronger in the religion department, and religion, like it or not, holds people together, it makes them feel united. This is because we all share an unavoidable feature to our lives - death and the unknown.</p>
<p>But back to the organisational skills of Moslems; just as an experiment try Googling &#8216;Islamic society/organisation&rsquo; for anytown; it&rsquo;s amazing what comes up. Huge, well organised operations, very professional websites with layer upon layer of services and programmes. From just 2 local sites alone I found all this: directories for youth progs, Women&rsquo;s progs, Libraries, wknd schools, social programmes, Evening Programmes, Directories for Islamic Businesses, Islamic Relief Orgs, Islamic television, radio, news services, cemeteries, orphanage sponsorship, al hadi schools, Islamic Primary and High Schools, language services, Koranic studies, donation progs, legal services, book sales, recipes, Islamic Clinics,Public relations services, on and on it goes;  and committee after committee for just about everything one could imagine and might need to live their entire lives with little need to mix with infidels. And as I said, all this from just two of many organisations in just one US city. These people are very highly organized; we had better be alert to this.<br>
 <br>
For example, in my neighborhood, I was driving out in a rural region and noticed fancy gate posts at the end of a long track, I drove down to take a look, and it has Arabic writing on it. In the distance I can see two new buildings. It makes you feel a little paranoid, but we know what they want because they&rsquo;ve told us, and it ain&rsquo;t to become assimilated. <br>
Arc.<br>

Arc.</p>
<p>Just outside Birmingham, UK lies open countryside comprised of agricultural farmland and livestock.  Right in a very secluded plot surrounded by tall trees and hedges, lay a mosque not visible from the road.  The Arabic signpost at the entrance of the drive was the only clue. </p>
<p>Referring to your feeling a little paranoid, I agree such discoveries relay a feeling of both anger and dispair when watching your city, town(s) and immediate neightbourhood become overrun with nonwhite Third World dross, but when our last refuge, the countryside also begins falling prey to the same infestations destined to lead inevitably to the systematic decay of the whole of your homeland, this triggers further feelings of deep psychological pain and sheer hopelessness.<br>

			<p>We must crack down on all the Muslim practices that are unacceptable in a Western country - not just terrorism but forced marriages, cousin-marriages, honour killings, promotion of violence, consuming vast quantities of welfare to raise excessive numbers of children etc.</p>
<p>I believe this would cause many of these Muslims to migrate back to their homelands, where many maintain close contact with their extended families. Let them return to their homelands if they want to live in their traditional ways.</p>
