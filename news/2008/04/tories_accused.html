						<p>The Conservatives were today hit by a &#8220;racism&#8221; row after two black party members claimed they were &#8220;stopped and searched&#8221; when trying to attend a local association meeting.</p>
<p>The men said they were &#8220;traumatised&#8221; by their treatment at the hands of party officials in Brent North.</p>
<p>They claim that even though they showed their membership cards and other identification, while others were waved into the association&rsquo;s AGM they were ordered to one side and &#8220;forced to empty their pockets&#8221; before being allowed to enter.</p>
<p>In a letter to Bob Blackman, the local Tory leader, Arena Sesay, 22, and Lawrence Okuns, 20, said they felt &#8220;like animals ready to be sent to the slaughter house&#8221;.</p>
<p>They added: &#8220;We strongly believe that the security personnel/chairman and yourself took a strong distaste to us at first sight because we are young blacks dressed in casual denim and bomber jackets and hair-braids/dreadlocks and did not fit your individual criteria of a young Conservative: lily-white, pin-striped articulate middle-class young man.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect such stereotyping from old white men .&nbsp;.&nsbp;. since we are victims of this in our daily lives and through our lives&rsquo; journeys, but not from public figures in office of an important political organisation as the Conservative Party, especially in Brent, where we have such a diverse population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Sesay and Mr Okuns accused Mr Blackman, the local London Assembly member and leader of the Conservative group on Brent council, of treating them in an &#8220;insensitive and unsympathetic&#8221; way.</p>
<p>Mr Sesay, a student, said their treatment was &#8220;appalling&#8221;. He said he had a membership card and a driving licence but &#8220;that was not good enough&#8221;. He added: &#8220;We were forced to empty our pockets and open our wallets to show other ID. We were left in the corner whilst the chairman and other Central Office representatives were debating our fate. To me it was racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men had been persuaded to join the Tories by Mr Sesay&rsquo;s mother, Sibo, a health visitor and long-standing party member.</p>
<p>Mr Okuns, also a student, said he did not believe the Conservatives at &#8220;the top&#8221; were racist. &#8220;I joined the party because I wanted to make a difference. People always say it&rsquo;s a racist party, I have been watching what&rsquo;s going on at the House of Commons and I don&rsquo;t think they are racist. It&rsquo;s people at a local level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Blackman admitted there had been a &#8220;degree of altercation&#8221; at the meeting but vigorously denied any suggestion of racism by him or his colleagues.</p>
<p>He said it was &#8220;rubbish&#8221; to claim Mr Sesay and Mr Okuns had been stopped and searched. &#8220;I take a very strong objection that any of us are racist in any shape or form. There must have been 140 people present and of them I would have thought 40 per cent were black or Asian,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Blackman said everyone attending who was not known to the stewards was asked for a membership card and ID.</p>
<p>He accused Mr Okuns and Mr Sesay of having a &#8220;different agenda&#8221; ahead of the mayoral and London Assembly elections next month.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the national Conservatives said: &#8220;The party takes matters such as this very seriously and we will be looking into the complaint.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The problem is that many of the young do not dress to impress anyone else than their own peers so if they are like many of the young in Britain now (But not all) binge drinking, into drugs and casual sex, they then dress to suit like it is a uniform.  It is the age of celebrities where  many think that by being outrageous and fashionable, they can earn lots of cash and not have to learn and work hard for a living.</p>
<p>So turning up at a Conservative Party meeting dressed as if they were going to a rave, they are searched.   If they had been white and dressed that way, they would have been searched as well.   But Britain is very concerned with terrorism especially with so many radicals now living there.   A suicide bomber at a Conservative meeting would be a great coup for the murdering swine.</p>
<p>Personally, I have never objected to being searched by a polite and legal person because my attitude is that I am likely then to be far safer at the meeting.  But I served my country in uniform (Air Force) for thirteen years and have also been a volunteer (unpaid) policeman with full powers so that the full-time cops working long hours could have weekends off to be with their families.  It is all a state of mind.  Love your country or leave it, so I now live in Spain.</p>
<p>It is all a question of attitude.</p>

			<p>The two look and dress the way of the thug.  Remember, Tories, suspend your common sense when dealing with blacks to prevent being called racist. And take your beatings and abuse from them when it happens because they&rsquo;ll just say that you called them a name anyway. </p>
<p>Blacks are vicious and merciless in their beloved ghettos but oh-so-fragile in constitution and conversation. They witness ongoing and brutal violence in their neighborhoods, but they are &#8220;traumatized&#8221; when frisked. Connect those dots if you can. </p>
<p>I would have stopped and frisked them as well   &mdash;   then refused them entry. If I&rsquo;m going to end up subjected to their abuse, at least I&rsquo;ll make it worth my while. </p>

			<p>Where did  the bomber jackets and dreadlocks go? do you suppose these two charmers saw fit to dress appropriately for their photo shoot, but lacked the manners to dress similarly for the Tory Association Meeting?. What this pair need to do is to learn how to behave and dress in polite society then they won&rsquo;t feel that &lsquo;lily-white, pin-striped articulate middle-class young men&rsquo; are discriminating against them.  Anyone who turns up at a political meeting dressed like a thug is going to get extra attention. <br>
 I wonder what their &lsquo;different agenda&rsquo; was?.<br>

			<p>First of all, these blacks moved to a predominately white country, so, therefore, they have no right to complain and bellyache.  On the other hand, I do think blacks in Africa have a right to complain about whites being there.  </p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in someone else&rsquo;s land, and you&rsquo;re not wanted there anyways, YOU should be on your best behavior and make the effort to be accepted by others.  </p>

<p>A generation ago, blacks generally conformed to society&rsquo;s norms of dress and deportment.  Now, many are complaining of &#8216;racism&rsquo; if they can&rsquo;t display ghetto styles in places that call for formal or semi-formal.   </p>

			<p>If a fella came in with a firemans hat on, i would think he was a fireman. If you come in dressed like a thug, you are a thug. if they stopped them they did the right thing, keep it up, dont give into these complaints, It&rsquo;s just their way of tearing down the system little pieces at a time. Resist.</p>

<p>The above is a good enough explanation for being suspect; regardless what color you are.  It was just convenient for them to scream &#8220;racism&#8221; because they wouldn&rsquo;t score points for complaining there were discriminated against because of the way they were dressed.</p>

			<p>In my experience, I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s a psuedo-religion for many black folk when they live or travel abroad to evangelize others of their blackness. For instance, there was this one blog by a black woman who lived in Europe as she worked for an American company.  And it was always a big deal for her when she did see a black person on the streets. She also derided the culture there a bit and was for all intents and purposes trying to promote her blackness.  Everything was about her being black and how the people their reacted to it.</p>

			<p>Blacks the world over always cry racism whenever they don&rsquo;t get their way.  Since when is racism a bad thing?  The word racism didn&rsquo;t even exist before 1933.  Racial superiority has always been an obvious and accepted fact of life.  And since when is discrimination and prejudice a bad thing?  Are not discrimination and prejudice a necessary part of the human survival instinct?  Does one not discriminate against a rattle snake vs a garter snake when one encounter one or the other in the back yard?</p>

  May I commend you on a most insightful and well thought out post. Forty years ago when the great prophet Enoch Powell raised the alarm those 60-something, 70-something &amp; 80-something &#8220;old men&#8221; were respectively 20, 30 &amp; 40-somethings. They undoubtedly laughed off Powell as a quack and a crank and now the laugh is on them. The immivasion of non-Whites to Britain, Canada and other White countries and the delayed, inchoate reaction to it of the host White community is a perfect example of the &#8220;Boiling Frog&#8221; story. Everything Powell so feared and predicted has now come to pass while so many witless, clued-out Whites incapable of thinking past next weeks television shows and sports games went about their lives aimlessly, while they slowly lost their country, dismissing Powell as a &#8220;racist&#8221; or fool - but Powell was right and they were wrong! Powell has the vindication of history while his detractors suffer the consequences he would have spared them from.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe racism is considered a criminal act, because if it were the government would have to define the word racism and the dictionary definition of the word racism is analogous with the word realist and the word realist is not a negative word&hellip;</p>
