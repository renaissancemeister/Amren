<h1>Ghetto Bragging Rights Community Hold Candle Light Vigil for Eric Boyd</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>underprivilegedJournalism, April 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thousands of Ghetto Bragging Rights community members rallied together in a virtual candlelight vigil for new Ghetto Black Male Felon Bragging Rights SuperThug Eric Dwayne Boyd.</p>
<p>In Knoxville, a smaller gathering assembled to raise commissary money and support for the first of the Knoxville5&rsquo;s illegal prosecution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve gathered here tonight on the streets Eric ran to to smoke our weed and pour out a little liquor for him,&#8221; a Knoxville Ghetto Bragging Rights thug said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can be sure that we will not see justice from the circus taking place in their halls of corruption tomorrow morning,&#8221; anti black poverty champ St. Nicolas Thief said. Thief, who has been in Knoxville to monitor the trial and coach blacks on staging theatrical social action protest robberies in protest of the city and State&rsquo;s institutional poverty said he is proud of Boyd&rsquo;s challenge to the court and Christian and Newsom families.</p>
<p>&#8220;In saying &#8220;Bring It Own&#8221; [sic] Eric said to the cluster of Knoxville&rsquo;s white devils : do what you. You can&rsquo;t harm me or none of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>In court, yesterday, Boyd again wagged his tail before the judge, jury and the condemning Knoxville white community with these words:</p>
<p>&#8220;I be ripping and running.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Walking up and down the streets of Ridgebrook, just drinking, smoking and drinking and smoking weed, that&rsquo;s all I do every day. I may go to Labor Ready on occasion so I can get a little more buzz money.&#8221; &mdash; Eric Dwayne Boyd</p>
<p>&#8220;Dogs,&#8221; Thief spit. &#8220;They are the children of their fathers! But Boyd let them and the whole world know: the penitentiary ain&rsquo;t shit for niggas. We do our work in the free world and are rewarded by God eternally. All experiences enlighten the soul of the black man and woman from our infidelities from God by intermingling with The Devil. There is no soul in white people! Never expect justice from them! Never expect righteousness from them! Throughout history and even unto this day their works are proven to be the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are those who can thank God for the darkness and His light. For we are dark but absorb His light. White people can be thankful for neither.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once upon a time God made His light fall on the just as well as the unjust all the same. Today God&rsquo;s light burns the skin of the unjust.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the the 2nd Knoxville 5 Carjacker support party didn&rsquo;t see the same attendance as the first, local thug and rapper Beast says they raised enough money to see to it Boyd, Cobbins, Davidson, Thomas and Coleman&rsquo;s commissary books will not go empty.</p>
<p>Thief would not confirm whether he met with the Boyd&rsquo;s younger brother, Anthony, who made their family&rsquo;s first public statements about Eric&rsquo;s illegal prosecution, tonight. One source said hee believes the two spoke.</p>
<p>Thief, who is expected to depart Knoxville after tomorrow&rsquo;s verdict, said he will return for the future trials &#8220;if fire and brimstone haven&rsquo;t consumed the whites of this damned city by then.&#8221;</p>

								<h2>Channon Christian Lie- &amp; Cover-Up</h2>
						<p>Do you ever get the feeling that it&rsquo;s just all one big perverted game to white people: their concepts of justice, decency, integrity and honor? Take, for example, the deviant behavior of United States Senators Mark Foley and Larry Craig &mdash; influential men in positions of public representation. We might even consider the Weapons of Mass Destruction motive that led them to the attack of Iraq and the murder of its leader. A disturbing pattern unfolds before us: people with personable public personas and dark reprobate agendas and lives. Can we, then, expect anything more of the people who vote for and support them? No. Hence, Channon Gail Christian and Christopher Newsom.</p>
<p>A TALE OF TWO CHANNONS</p>
<p>A GHETTO BRAGGING RIGHTS MEMBER WRITES</p>
<p>I do know that &lsquo;chan&rsquo; as she was called by her friends and (a) friend used to meet Black men together for sex. Fact. I know that channon was online and setting s &mdash; up with one or more of them. I know the authorities discovered that she, like most white women of breeding age, wasn&rsquo;t innocent of anything, she liked rough sex, she craved pain, would seek out dangerous situations, liked gang-bangs and crept around like they all do now. She wanted exactly what she got and got what she deserved. It just a shame that quality Brothers got to go down taking these demons down.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears that white people are consumed with the debased and immoral behavior that leads to situations like that of Mak [sic] Foley, Larry Craig and Channon Christian. Much more than a game, they are involved in a perverted subconcious contest to see who can win at playing their game of fraudulent lifestyles. Again the Lord sees how great their wickedness on the earth has become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart are only evil all the time. And as they do not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient,&#8221; quoting from the Bible said Ghetto Bragging Rights publisher Kirkland Perkins.<br>
