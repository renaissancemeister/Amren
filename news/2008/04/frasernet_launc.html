			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, 	PRWeb (Ferndale, Washington), April 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><i>FrasetNet, the leading on-line business network for Black professionals, will launch FraserNetsearch, a cutting-edge client side search engine and business network that delivers ultra-fast, relevant results to its users. Using technology developed by tyBit, Inc., this state-of-the art technology will allow the creation of an interactive networking culture by supporting one another and building wealth.</i></p>
<p>Cleveland, Ohio (PRWEB) April 28, 2008 &mdash; Founded in 1987, FraserNet (www.frasernet.com) is the oldest and leading online business network for Black professionals worldwide reaching over one million professionals and business owners each year. It has helped its members garner thousands of jobs and over $500 million in new business. FraserNet has evolved, grown and will launch FraserNetsearch, a cutting-edge client side search engine and business network that delivers ultra-fast, relevant results to users. Using technology developed specifically for FraserNet and its members by tyBit Inc. to promote their products and services and achieve their professional objectives, this &lsquo;state of the art&rsquo; technology will allow the creation of an interactive networking culture by supporting one another and building wealth. FraserNet will release to the public FraserNetsearch at its annual conference in Atlanta, Georgia, June 18-21, 2008. The PowerNetworking Conference is the largest networking training conference in Black America.</p>
<p>&#8220;FraserNetsearch provides our community unparalleled access to the people and resources they need to succeed,&#8221; said George Fraser, Chairman and CEO of FraserNet. What distinguishes FraserNetsearch from other so-called black search engines is the fact that advertisers are predominately African American-owned businesses and the internet advertising network is relevant to their local, national and international businesses. This means regardless of the location of the user, the business owner can promote their product and service information on the Internet. This creates a global market for African American owned businesses and the consumers they are trying to reach. Whether they are located in downtown Cleveland or on the continent of Africa, Black businesses and professionals can be found easily on FraserNetsearch. FraserNetsearch is customizable, unifying search results from multiple data sources, where users search the web anonymously and securely with real time protection from malware and spyware.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited about the opportunity to work with the global community and our members; at the same time we are open to any businesses that want to advertise on FraserNetsearch. We will be able to develop interactive ad campaigns using images, video, music, and text content. Moreover, the FraserNetsearch platform provides a tool to comparison shop online for the best deals,&#8221; said George Fraser.</p>
<p>About FraserNet: George Fraser, Chairman and CEO of FraserNet, is one of the new voices for African Americans and one of the foremost authorities on networking, building effective relationships and economic/business development. Mr. Fraser is the author of three critically best sellers: Success Runs In Our Race; The Complete Guide to Effective Networking in the Black Community, Race For Success; The Ten Best Business Opportunities for Blacks In America (selected as one of ten best business books of the year by Booklist) both published by HarperCollins in 1994.1998. His latest book is titled Click: Ten Truths for Building Extraordinary Relations (McGraw Hill, 2008).
