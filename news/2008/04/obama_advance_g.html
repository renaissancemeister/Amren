						<p>From the account in Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s paper, the Tartan, of a Michelle Obama event in Pittsburgh:</p>
<blockquote>While the crowd was indeed diverse, some students at the event questioned the practices of Mrs. Obama&rsquo;s event coordinators, who handpicked the crowd sitting behind Mrs. Obama. The Tartan&rsquo;s correspondents observed one event coordinator say to another, &#8220;Get me more white people, we need more white people.&#8221; To an Asian girl sitting in the back row, one coordinator said, &#8220;We&rsquo;re moving you, sorry. It&rsquo;s going to look so pretty, though.&#8221;
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know they would say, &lsquo;We need a white person here,&rsquo;&#8221; said attendee and senior psychology major Shayna Watson, who sat in the crowd behind Mrs. Obama. &#8220;I understood they would want a show of diversity, but to pick up people and to reseat them, I didn&rsquo;t know it would be so outright.&#8221;</blockquote></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s any real reason for outrage here; every campaign, at least implicitly, includes race in the staging of events like this &mdash; even a campaign whose supporters chant &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t matter.&#8221; But they don&rsquo;t usually get caught doing it this explicitly.</p>
<p>And (if you didn&rsquo;t pick it up from the bowling) it does give you a sense of the community Obama&rsquo;s trying to reach in Pennsylvania: whitefolks.<br>

											<p>
							<i>Andrew Peters, The Tartan (Carnegie Mellon University), April 7, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Only a week after her husband drew throngs to Soldiers and Sailors, Michelle Obama wooed a small crowd at Skibo Gymnasium on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Skibo&rsquo;s risers were packed with community members and students from many of Pittsburgh&rsquo;s universities. The rally was staffed by volunteers from a number of Carnegie Mellon student organizations, including Carnegie Mellon Students for Barack Obama, Student Senate, AB Political Speakers, and College Democrats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the crowd was indeed diverse, some students at the event questioned the practices of Mrs. Obama&rsquo;s event coordinators, who handpicked the crowd sitting behind Mrs. Obama. The Tartan&rsquo;s correspondents observed one event coordinator say to another, &#8220;Get me more white people, we need more white people.&#8221; To an Asian girl sitting in the back row, one coordinator said, &#8220;We&rsquo;re moving you, sorry. It&rsquo;s going to look so pretty, though.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know they would say, &lsquo;We need a white person here,&rsquo;&#8221; said attendee and senior psychology major Shayna Watson, who sat in the crowd behind Mrs. Obama. &#8220;I understood they would want a show of diversity, but to pick up people and to reseat them, I didn&rsquo;t know it would be so outright.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see this as any big deal but this woman scares me. She is a very angry woman who is resentful and hateful of White people. She and Rev. Wright are peas in a pod. I believe Barack feels the same way as these people. That&rsquo;s why he married this woman and that&rsquo;s why he stayed with Rev. Wright for 20 years. He&rsquo;s a politician so you will only see what he wants you to see of himself but trust me the three of them are peas in a pod. Wake up America!<br>

			<p>This staged nonsense has been going on for years. On practically every tv show with an audience, like talk shows, America&rsquo;s funniest videos, judge shows, etc, you see &#8220;diversity&#8221; directly behind the host. Like we are supposed to believe that we are such a diverse utopia, that things just naturally occur like this. It is sickening. </p>

			<p>I think you&rsquo;re using the term &#8220;white people&#8221; loosely when you refer to whites who  actually show up to an Obama rally. Race is more than skin color, it&rsquo;s about ideals. Ideals that white Obama supporters obviously don&rsquo;t grasp.</p>

			<p>Obama Hussein wouldn&rsquo;t care on iota if whites voted for him, if he didn&rsquo;t need their votes in huge numbers to get elected.  He wants to be president strictly to do what he can to manipulate the system to try to elevate blacks from their present failing positions, because they can&rsquo;t do it themselves on their abilities alone.  </p>
<p>He will not concede that they are just not evolved enough to compete in a first world civilization.  The only change he cares about is one that will give blacks even more privileges than they have right now.</p>
<p>His immature idea of bringing blacks and whites together is to convince whites to admit the only reason blacks have failed and are failing now is due to some attitude or policy on their part.  He blames even black on white crime and violence to somehow be the fault of whites.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s elected and is able to overwhelmingly favor blacks in all his policies and blacks still fail, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll still blame whites somehow.  They didn&rsquo;t hold their mouths right or they didn&rsquo;t honor blacks enough or something equally as silly.</p>
<p>Obama is like most every black throughout the country.  Their only concern is other blacks the world over and to hell with their countrymen of another race.  If it isn&rsquo;t blacks right here he concentrates on, it will be the ones in Haiti, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, etc. </p>
<p>And his wife?  Well, if if we look at Jeremiah Wright long enough we will see her face transposed over his. </p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the tenents of his church say that they concentrate solely on Africa and blacks?</p>
<p>Any white who votes for this man is a fool.</p>

			<p>Years ago some friends of my wife were working at some children&rsquo;s event in Minneapolis that was going to be given some coverage on the local news. The children attending the event seated themselves first come, first serve. My wife&rsquo;s friends were then told to put minority children in the front center. Whenever you see images of a diverse group of children, it is never a coincidence that the black ones are in the front middle. </p>
<p>You see this in advertising, too. If there is a shot of two or more models together, the black one will always be in the dominent position: shoulders placed in front of the white model, the white model placed behind and off to the side of the black model, the black model in the center when the group is an odd number. Black dominance is a total fabrication of white media.</p>

			<p>After all the information regarding Obama&rsquo;s attendance for the last twenty years, at a radically racist anti-white church, the absolute stupidness of regular white working class democrats in supporting Obama is breathtaking. Oh, I understand the support he gets from liberal progressive upper class whites and the political elite in the Democratic Party, they are clueless. But the other group&hellip;&hellip;.? It makes you shake your head in bewilderment.</p>

			<p>Of course, race matters, even for the Obama campaign.  The bottom line is that they are going to have to reach out to the Reagan Democrats, the blue-collar white voters who voted for Reagan in 1980 and 1984, and largely voted for Bush Junior in 2000 and 2004.  </p>
<p>Given that McCain is an open-borders neocon with liberal tendencies, the job shouldn&rsquo;t be that difficult.</p>

If you read my previous post, you might get the impression that I am an Obama supporter.  Strictly speaking, I am not.  I still want to see Ron Paul run as a third-party candidate.</p>
<p>However, I must say that I think Obama would be preferable to McCain, and not because of some &#8220;worse is better&#8221; scenario (although I believe in the &#8220;worse is better&#8221; concept to some extent).  Yes, Obama is every bit the open-borders advocate as McCain, but he would be facing more congressional opposition to any form of amnesty than &#8220;McKennedy&#8221; would.  In addition, I am VERY worried about McCain&rsquo;s short temper and his desire to escalate our military presence in the Middle East. </p>

			<p>Michelle Obama&rsquo;s coordinators are trying to artificially create a whiter audience in a ploy to get a blacker white house. At the same time, the powers that be are trying to force the issue in another way. The newest &#8220;buzz&#8221; I hear is a raucous plea for McCain to name Condoleeza Rice as his running mate. The left is bound and determined to get a black into the oval office by hook or by crook  &mdash;  no matter whether the American public would vote for such a thing or not. As far as  they are concerned, the American public should have no choice in the matter.</p>

			<p>RE the Obama &#8220;Get more white people&#8221; article.</p>
<p>Funny how that works. Several years ago, a local shopping mall was having bad image problems due to several high-profile black gang killings in the mall. What was the solution that the mall management discussed in a meeting to bring in more business and clean the place up? &#8220;Get more white people.&#8221; It was leaked out and caused a big stink among the local black victimologist leadership, of course. Local leaders of the Nation of Islam, Million Man March, Inc., and who knows who else, got on TV in a press conference and immedidately began to lean into mall management. Of course, it worked. The white mall managers groveled, begged, and caved in.</p>

<p>Going to malls might be unpleasant due to the feeling of insecurity.</p>
<p>Perhaps one solution migth be exclusive &#8220;shopping clubs&#8221; ie. malls that require membership as a prerequisite for entering the building. </p>

If they come up with a thousand economic plans and ideas to save the country ..what chance is there that any of them will be listen to now? Its over.</p>

			<p>Here is the bottom line of Obama Administration.<br>
More quotas for &#8220;minorities&#8221; who are no longer minorities.<br>
More forgiveness for black culture&rsquo;s failures.<br>
More Political Correctness witch hunts.</p>
<p>In other words the rise of a vicious, hysterical group of fringe lunatics whose one goal is to destroy the culture that<br>
reminds them of who there really are.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s called &#8220;blonking&#8221;, - getting blacks on camera.</p>
<p>The cameraman is supposed to look around the crowd until he finds a black face, then focus on them so as to make out that many in the audience are black. Or when a government minister goes to visit the troops abroad they wake up black soldiers in the middle of their sleep in order that they can &#8220;just happen&#8221; to be standing behind Gordon Brown or whoever.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if there really is no black face, such as at a classical music concert, or at some liberal/lefty do like an animal rights demo or open air pop concert, then an Asian or Oriental will have to do.</p>

Dear GAWD, this woman is such a lost soul.</p>
<p>Did she think &#8220;pursuing diversity&#8221; was a subtle process? <br>
Or <br>
Is she admitting that most sophisticated diversitards perfer to furtively hide (albeit almost always clumsily) their nefarious intentions?</p>
<p>&hellip; perhaps she was just dumbstruck by His radiant, messianic auro. I heard the man gives white women the vapors. </p>

			<p>The world is running out of white people. Atlas is Shrugging.</p>
<p>My brother works in Hollywood. He tells me it is STANDARD PROCEDURE to rearrange the crowd in the back-ground of any video shot so that there are Africans and Mongolians and Mexicans showing in every scene. It is staged. It is faked and it is somehting that would make Stalin/Hitler so  proud of our propaganda machine.</p>
<p>But remember.: There is no such thing as race&hellip; One&rsquo;s skin color makes no difference&hellip;..We are all equal&hellip;.Race makes no difference&hellip;.we are not to judge by appearances&hellip;.to judge by color is to stereotype&hellip;..to say people of a certain color are alike is racial profiling&hellip;..</p>
<p>Any white at an Obama meeting is a race traitor anyway. Maybe it is a good idea to have photos of them. This might come in handy.</p>
<p>Also notice the number of blondes on the stages. Boy oh boy do they like blondes. Can&rsquo;t blame them.</p>

<p>Well. That&rsquo;s certainly an invitation to blacks who run SA to come up with a plan. The world bank too. If only to make people like this poster look bad. It shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard. You might keep in mind, the actually racial make-up of the country is the same as it was before.  </p>
<p>Wonder if that will be a consolation to the whites left in SA? A vibrant, thriving SA? I don&rsquo;t see a vibrant, and thriving SA, one proped up by the world bank, that also persecutes them and ignores their concerns, being a consolation to whites in SA. We&rsquo;ll probably never know, however. Well, a rising tide floats all boats&hellip; </p>

<p>Look at the T.V. commercials.  They&rsquo;ve been &#8220;diversifying&#8221; not only the background crowd for years now, they never show a group of whites together using a product they want you to buy without including at least one non-white.  Often when a scene shows two buddies watching T.V. it&rsquo;s a black and a white.  And a group of guys at somebody&rsquo;s house watching a ball game on T.V.?  Yes, there&rsquo;s a brother there too.  And it&rsquo;s all a contribution from the Hollyweird freaks and the Ad people who feel it is their jobs to help push us all into diversity because they just love the idea.</p>
<p>I was at a chain drug store a few days ago observing the advertisements on the wall for various products and there was not one single white in the entire photo line up.</p>
<p>What poetic justice it would be if the white weirdos responsible for all this were forced to live in the multicultural utopia that insanely dances around within their minds constantly.</p>
<p>The way the economy is going, that is now a very real possibility. </p>

			<p>One quick question: Picture an Obama presidency (perish the thought)! Now just how surrounded would he be by White (experienced even capable) officials as opposed to the worthless Sharpton, Jackson, Quannel X types?</p>
<p>Obama is going to UNITE the races? More likely than not, drive a chasm as wide as the Pacific Ocean between them. After four years of his phony strutting and posturing, a Black would have a tough fight, hoping to be elected to dog catcher.</p>

			<p>Race is more than skin color, it&rsquo;s about ideals. Ideals that white Obama supporters obviously don&rsquo;t grasp.</p>

<p>BINGO!!!!!</p>
<p>But, to that I would add, &#8220;and NOT just Obama supporters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most important group are people like us who care about what is going on and are not duped into believing that caring about this enough to want to talk about it makes us racist. </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not really about &#8220;ideals&#8221; it&rsquo;s about Ideas.  There&rsquo;s a difference.  But, of all the many important ideas found in the West, the most imporant of all, the one that seperates it from every other culture, is something most of us just don&rsquo;t know anything about; which would explain why we don&rsquo;t discuss it.  I&rsquo;m convinced that if we did, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in the mess we&rsquo;re in today.  </p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s get a grass-roots effort moving. MAIL copies of all negative Obama stories to EVERYONE you know. Computer labels are cheap. Copies are cheap. GET a mailing list started. Even if you have to pick a hundred names out of the phone book. But MAIL copies of such stories out. We HAVE to get White people thinking what an unmitigated distaster and Obama presidency would be.</p>
<p>Either we get off our backsides and do everything humanly possible, or we simply don&rsquo;t have any right to complain if the &#8220;Obamination&#8221; makes it to the White House.</p>
