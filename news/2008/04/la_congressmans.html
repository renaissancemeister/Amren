					<p>Political corruption is rampant.  And it&rsquo;s not a black issue.  Are we forgetting that horrendous politician Duke Cunningham?  And Cunningham had a bunch of co-conspirators.  Are we supposed to assume that subverting the political system runs through the inner psyche of white businessmen in DC?  Obviously an outlandish statement.        </p>

They could make a TV series about this upwardly mobile black family, and call it &#8220;The Jeffersons.&#8221;</p>

					<p>To the person: &#8220;Posted by at 7:52 PM on April 4&#8221;</p>
<p>Vietnam war hero Cunningham became corrupt, was found out, confessed his guilt, and tearfully took his sentence standing up.  He&rsquo;ll pay for the rest of his life, and he hasn&rsquo;t cried racism, abuse, or victimhood.</p>
<p>Now tell me which corrupt leftist politico has done that. When Barney Frank&rsquo;s boy-lover was pimping homosexual sex out of the former&rsquo;s home, everyone gave him a pass. Frank cried the &#8220;homophobia&#8221; mantra when found out, and it worked. </p>
<p>&#8220;Footsy&#8221; Senator Craig is the only holdout hoping he can take the usual legal detours to be acquitted, but then again, he didn&rsquo;t steal from anyone, destroy anyone other than himself, nor did he try to ruin anyone&rsquo;s career. To Repubicans, by the way, he&rsquo;s no longer a party member. </p>
<p>Virtue and character is an anathema to the left.  They leave that to practicing Christians and Jews and usually mock them in the process. </p>
<p>You might want to understand, the person who posted at 7:52 pm, that the only accepted prejudice in the country is against white Christian males.</p>
<p>You can now go back defending your fundamentally corrupt leftist heros in government   &mdash;   at all levels. And take heart, your &#8220;brave new world&#8221; will soon be he law of the land here in America. Obey the leaders of this new system and you&rsquo;ll be okay.  Poor,         </p>

					<p>To finish up my last post, person who posted at 7:52 pm; I meant to close by saying that those of you who tow the liberal party line in the future will be allocated according to your need, and no more.   </p>
<p>If you are a black or brown person other than those from India, you will be allowed many freedoms the rest of the population will not. Political correctness has already started that social sickness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to be as incompetent and corrupt at will. Of course, unless you&rsquo;re be one of the living prophets, as liberals treat their politicians, you&rsquo;ll be as poor as the rest of us.  </p>

					<p>To Proactive,</p>
<p>   I assume you say Cunningham &#8220;stood up&#8221; to receive his sentence to try to portray him as a valiant Christian and Jewish male, one of the last upholders of an ordered world, who had fallen but still possessed a nobility that transcends the dusky brave new world. </p>
<p>   This must have been the puffed-up illusion of Cunningham too.  He cried when he received his 8 year prison sentence because his ordered world had been crushed.  He was an egomaniac who believed as the returning hero he was entitled to degrade public trust however his untouchable self desired.  He cried, perhaps a little less hysterically, when his son was sentenced for cocaine.  He cried, just a sniffle, when he was beaten in a shouting match on the House floor, and ran to the men&rsquo;s room to find a corner to cry in (this actually happened).  <br>

					<p>This shows well what I have been saying since Katrina. The place is a crazy world where most live under water or indictment. Jefferson is a typical pelican politician. His race has nothing to do about it, except making him easier and cheaper to buy.<br>
     Cunningham had things that Bill Gates couldn`t buy. He was an honest to Heaven hero and he threw it all away for trinkets. His republicanism must have aided his fall from grace. Foley seduced young boys and is still walking around Palm Beach crusing for young trim.<br><br>
     The Government indicted Jefferson`s stupid brother to put pressure on Jefferson to plead guilty to keep him from a trial that would expose the ghastly and criminally responsible negligence in the Katrina aftermath done by the republicans. Jefferson knows how much the republican money machine skimmed off the top.<br><br>
     I have found that black politicians are as corrupt as any other group; however they act like dope dealers and want to show off their bling. This makes them easy pickings for bored prosecutors. One day we will at last have the guts to accept reality and treat most blacks like the dim witted grown up children they are.<br><br>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t try to call him (Cunningham) noble about anything.  He lost all honor by his actions.  </p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t try to misplace blame or redirect responsibility, &#8220;posted by&#8221;, and he took his punishment   &mdash;   emotionally or otherwise.  </p>
<p>Brutha Jefferson, like Bruta Kwamee in <span class="caps">DIE</span>troit, have already played the race card in their attempt to displace responsibility or minimize their culpabilty.  That game shows their personality rot to the core. They also use rage as a demonstration of their egotistical position that they&rsquo;re above any responsibility and wrongdoing.  It&rsquo;s their &#8220;do you know who I am&#8221; approach.   </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t defend the devils, &#8220;posted by&#8221;, you&rsquo;ll only get more of them stealing from you. </p>

					<p>OF <span class="caps">COURSE </span>it &#8220;runs in the family.&#8221; THEY&rsquo;RE <span class="caps">BLACKS</span>! So, expectedly, they&rsquo;ll play the race card and lie non-stop about their crimes. But, as mentioned, they&rsquo;re Blacks!</p>
<p>The surpise is <span class="caps">NOT </span>that both Jeffersons are crooks. The surprise is that Blacks, as a group, simply are incapable of understanding <span class="caps">WHY </span>we feel so much contempt for their race. In other words, <span class="caps">FOR ALL BLACKS</span>! They&rsquo;ve proven their genetic inferiority, their inbred predisposition to crime and mindless violence too many, many times. In America. In Africa. Even those who migrated to Europe.</p>
