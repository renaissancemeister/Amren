						<p>Eric Dewayne &#8220;E&#8221; Boyd&rsquo;s own words will either set him free or send him to prison, jurors seated to decide the fate of this alleged accessory to a fatal carjacking were told Wednesday.</p>
<p>Boyd is charged with helping hide out Lemaricus &#8220;Slim&#8221; Davidson, the alleged ringleader in the torture slaying of 21-year-old Channon Christian and 23-year-old Christopher Newsom in January 2007, and failing to report what he knew about those slayings to police.</p>
<p>He gave a videotaped statement to Knoxville Police Department Investigators Patty Tipton and Greg McKnight soon after his arrest. That videotape will be a key bit of evidence for both sides, if opening statements in the U.S. District Court trial are any indication.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Christian and Newsom were out on a date on Jan. 6, 2007, when they were confronted at gunpoint, Christian&rsquo;s Toyota 4-Runner commandeered and the couple taken to a house on Chipman Street leased by Davidson.</p>
<p>Both would wind up dead, and Davidson and three others, including his brother, would be charged in Knox County Criminal Court with a slew of crimes including first-degree murder, kidnapping and rape. All four face the death penalty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, Jennings and Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy Stone still must link Davidson to both the carjacking and the slayings in order to prove Boyd is guilty of being an accessory to a fatal carjacking.</p>
<p>Because of that, Jennings on Wednesday had to unveil details of the slayings that authorities so far have kept under wraps. The courtroom was packed with friends and family of Christian and Newsom as Jennings detailed the horrors the young couple endured.</p>
<p>Newsom was slain first but not before he was repeatedly raped.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; tie him up, gag him, wrap him in cloth material &hellip; shot him in the back, shot him in the neck, one of those shots which would have left him paralyzed, and then shot a killshot to his head,&#8221; Jennings said. &#8220;Then, his body was doused with gasoline and set afire.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What was happening to Channon Christian?&#8221; Jennings asked. &#8220;She was being gang-raped. You will hear how brutally and savagely she was treated. How long could this have gone on? For hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>At some point, Christian&rsquo;s attackers bound her and stashed her inside a trash can, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The evidence will be when Channon Christian went into that trash can, bound, for hours .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she was alive,&#8221; Jennings said.</p>
<p>Christian would remain alive until sometime in the evening of Jan. 7, a Sunday, Jennings said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercifully, Channon Christian died Sunday evening,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Her body would not be discovered until Jan. 9.</p>
<p>Boyd is accused of helping Davidson hide out from Jan. 10 until Jan. 11, providing him food and a cell phone, staying with him inside a vacant house the pair broke into and begging people for cash and a car so both he and Davidson could flee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

															<h2>Surprise Testimony Puts Boyd Closer to Deaths</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, April 10, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Xavier Jenkins is &#8220;100-percent sure&#8221; he saw Nicole Mathis&rsquo; white Sunbird parked behind Channon Christian&rsquo;s sport-utility vehicle outside a house on Chipman Street on the night of Christian&rsquo;s kidnapping.</p>
<p>Mathis testified today that her cousin, Eric Dewayne &#8220;E&#8221; Boyd, had borrowed her car a day or two before and still had possession of it on that January 2007 weekend, when Jenkins says he saw it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boyd is charged with being an accessory to the carjacking by helping hide out Lamaricus &#8220;Slim&#8221; Davidson, the alleged ringleader in the killings that occurred at the home he rented on Chipman Street. Boyd also is accused of failing to report what he knew about those slayings to police.</p>
<p>Jenkins worked at a business next door to the Chipman Street house and has no ties to anyone involved in the case.</p>
<p>Testimony from Mathis came after she said she spent months lying to authorities because of pressure from her family.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the witness stand today, Mathis denied ever going to the Chipman Street house or knowing Davidson.</p>
<p>If jurors believe Mathis, it puts a major hole in Lomonaco&rsquo;s defense and today&rsquo;s testimony raises the specter that Boyd was at the house while Christian and Newsom were being victimized.</p>
<p>Among other testimony today, Christian&rsquo;s best friend, Kara Sowards, described the night her friend went missing.</p>
<p>Sowards told jurors that Christian and Newsom were supposed to join her and a group of their closest friends at a house in Halls to celebrate Jamie Hampton&rsquo;s birthday, but that the couple never showed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both would wind up dead, and Davidson and three others, including his brother, were charged in Knox County Criminal Court with a slew of crimes including first-degree murder, kidnapping and rape. All four face the death penalty.</p>
<p>Boyd gave a videotaped statement to Knoxville Police Department Investigators Patty Tipton and Greg McKnight soon after his arrest. That videotape will be a key bit of evidence for both sides, if Wednesday&rsquo;s opening statements in the U.S. District Court trial are any indication.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will realize once you hear that statement that he&rsquo;s confessed to the two charges in this indictment,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney David Jennings told jurors Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Boyd made a statement and you need to listen to that statement,&#8221; defense attorney Phil Lomonaco countered. &#8220;He said, &#8216;I told (Davidson) to turn himself in.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When he told me what happened, I didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with him. That&rsquo;s when I left.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The [jury] panel includes four men and 12 women. One woman is black. The remaining 15 people are white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boyd is accused of helping Davidson hide out from Jan. 10 until Jan. 11, providing him food and a cell phone, staying with him inside a vacant house the pair broke into and begging people for cash and a car so both he and Davidson could flee.</p>
<p>Lomonaco told jurors that Boyd had no idea when he was aiding Davidson that his pot-smoking friend was involved in a fatal carjacking. Once Davidson confessed his alleged crimes, Lomonaco said Boyd left Davidson behind in the vacant house on Reynolds Street under the guise of getting him food.</p>
<p>Boyd did not alert police, Lomonaco conceded, but was stopped by police a short time later anyway. He immediately told them where to find Davidson, the attorney said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police, after they let (Boyd) go, thanked him,&#8221; Lomonaco said.</p>

			<p>I know Newsom&rsquo;s parents believe race played a role which we all know it did.  But, it will be interesting to see if Christian&rsquo;s parents finally acknowledge it after they hear the gory details.  You know white folks are really brainwashed when even the brutal slaying of their child doesn&rsquo;t invoke racial solidarity and the desire for self-preservation.<br>

			<p>With Boyd&rsquo;s testimony videotaped by police, I don&rsquo;t see how the main defendants in the case have a chance.  He&rsquo;s still likely to get a lot of time for being an accessory to this crime after the fact, and possibly for obstruction of justice for initially concealing what he knew from the police.</p>
<p>If prosecutors don&rsquo;t successfully get the death penalty for the other four, there isn&rsquo;t much point in having one in this country.  A crime this barbaric simply screams, &#8220;These men were born human by mistake.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I wrote this Jamie Satterfield, telling her that blacks are but 13% of the population yet commit 58% of all violent crime, when she wrote of this story before.</p>
<p>I posted her reply to me on this web site as soon as I received<br>
it.  She said that I should be shot for writing what I did.</p>
<p>These leftist radicals are so far out in left field they couldn&rsquo;t think objectively if their lives depended on it.  Notice where her outrage is, with somebody criticizing black on white crime, instead of the black perpetrators for such an outrageous, brutal torture-murder. </p>
<p>I wonder if she&rsquo;s aware enough to understand that atrocities like these are committed, because of the prompting by the Jeremiah Wrights rife within the black community, and such acts are encouraged even further by the radical MSM&rsquo;s refusal to give the incidents the same play as the much fewer crimes that occur that are white on black?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s about as disgusting as they get.</p>

			<p>Here is yet another horrific REAL black hate crime against a person of light (part of the daily reality in this country) that just occurred and that in normal fashion has been completely ignored by the media:<br>
&#8220;&hellip; a Chinese graduate student at Columbia University, Minghui Yu, was killed last Friday when black youths violently set upon him, sending him running into traffic to escape, &hellip;&#8221;<br>

			<p>I wonder.. how many black people would behave as this if they were sure to get away with it? This heated type depravity seems perfected by the dark race. I think segregation between racial extremes comes natural, we operate on different wave lengths. The prolonged unspeakable pain these victims must have suffered&hellip; and why?  because they were white? I think jelousy is natural for blacks to have for whites and it will always resurface regardless of honest efforts by whites or blacks. The humiliation and wretched pain these genteel youth suffered at the hands of primitive thugs cannot be undone. </p>

			<p>Even if they all get the death penalty it&rsquo;s not enough for a crime like this.  Perhaps if we tortured and raped them in exactly the same way they tortured and raped their victims, that would be the first glimmer of justice.  Let them see how it feels.</p>

			<p>I imagine when the four major defendants are sentenced, we will hear about how their fathers were absent, how low their self-esteem is, and how this was only &#8220;done to them&#8221; because they are black.</p>
<p>I still disagree with the decision not to prosecute this as a hate crime.  None of those four would have spent hours torturing a pair of animals, shooting one and then stuffing the other into a trash can until it died of hypothermia, shock and despair.</p>
<p>Nearly everything about this case absolutely infuriates me.  </p>

<p>To me it&rsquo;s irrelevant whether or not the crimes committed by blacks against whites are &#8220;racial&#8221; or not. For some reason, if whites can convince themselves that the victims in these crimes were not selected because they were white, then they judge the crimes as having no racial significance.</p>
<p>The racial significance of these crimes (whatever their motivation) is that if blacks were still segregated away from whites, as they were formerly in the U.S South, these crimes would not be occurring.</p>

 The answer to that is a resounding NO!!! The white race is so mired in guilt that nothing short of near genocide will ever awaken the majority of white people.Only when hundreds of thousands per day are marched at gunpoint through death chambers will the whites awaken as a race.</p>

<p>The above is a masterful example of MSM sleight-of-hand.  &#8220;Would wind up dead&#8221;?  An absurd usage, when &#8220;were killed&#8221; would have been more appropriate.  But that&rsquo;s not how the MSM rolls.  To the controlled media, all black rapists/murderers are only &#8220;alleged&#8221;, &#8220;suspected&#8221;, &#8220;charged&#8221; or &#8220;purported&#8221; but never, ever is it suggested that they are guilty.</p>

			<p>To the person who said &#8220;guilt&#8221; is our anchor I think it more appropriate to say that fear is our ruler.  America has become the Jim Jones cult writ large.  I seriously doubt millions of white Americans feel any real guilt, but I would guess that they fear being called a &#8220;racist&#8221; (whatever that really means).</p>

In one way you&rsquo;re statement is plausible and worth a lot of attention, though obviously a post at a Realist site won&rsquo;t do justice. An article might do the trick however. Be that as it may, one thing has become pretty clear, </p>
<p>For Whites, the price of admission into ANY conversation on the subject of Race is - guilt.</p>
<p>The absurdity is that many Whites feel guilt when they are not guilty. Not ONE white person is guilty today.  Not one!<br>
Family is far more important than Race, but we talk about Race as if it were ALL important.  For two reasons,<br>
 <br>
1- Most don&rsquo;t want to talk about Family, and we are definitely more guilty of participating in multi-generational abuse and neglect then we are of any impropriety surrounding Race.  But we can&rsquo;t own up to the guilt, within our Families and within our Race (whatever that Race may be, but here I am talking about Whites).  So, we repress that energy and redirect it toward a psuedo-issue, Race.  </p>
<p>2- Those who control public discourse don&rsquo;t want us to talk about Family because they don&rsquo;t CARE about it.  Family, God, Whites, these are clear obstacles, in the form of competition, to their Utopian ideal.  That&rsquo;s why they have rigged ALL discussion of Race so that Whites can&rsquo;t defend themselves and certainly can&rsquo;t ascert pride in being White, without being accused of Racism.  It&rsquo;s their ignoble way of disarming someone who, under a fair system, could easily invalid date their entire belief-system.  The fact of the matter is that they have NO arguement that could survive a thorough-going analysis, and it wouldn&rsquo;t even take that to reduce their point of view to rubble.  So they are fighting us with the ONLY instrument they have, censorship.  Up until now that weapon has been formidable.  But the Internet is quickly disolving their world wide web of denial.</p>

			<p>I posted (essentially) the following to the original first article from The Knoxville News Sentinel:</p>
<p>Will the trial of the accused in this case receive one-tenth the NATIONAL media attention that the NON-CRIME of the Duke Lacrosse team received?</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Justice crime statistics show over 37,000 White women raped by Blacks in 2005, and ZERO Black women raped by Whites!</p>
<p><a href="/bjs/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv0542.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv0542.pdf</a></p>
<p>Yet, nationally, we heard virtually nothing about those 37,000 White victims of real rape by Blacks, but we were nearly crushed under the weight of news about that ZERO Black (non) victim of (non) rape in the Duke (non) case.</p>
<p>Something to think about is, &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>The site amren.com is an excellent place to begin in acquiring some understanding of the racial dynamic currently at work in this country.<br>

			<p>I love to hear the usual whining about the &#8220;controlled&#8221; media. News people are not supposed to refer to suspects as guilty, till surprise, they are declared guilty. If they did otherwise, could you imagine how the defense would use that?</p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t even believe the sickness of this crime. It is beyond animalistic. Even animals, for the most part, only kill to eat. Furthermore, since these crimes happen so often in one form or other, it is a sign that something is terribly wrong with this society in general. The liberal progressive programs, that have done their work on the minds of Americans of all ages, in such a corrosive manner for the last fifty years, are largely to blame. Situational ethics, the idea that there is no absolute right or wrong, the entitlement programs, the feelings of faux freedom, have  all caused tremendous damage to this society and other societies, where the liberal/progressive programs have been adopted.</p>

There is another table for &#8220;multiple offenders&#8221;: There are about 8,000 white women GANG RAPED by blacks each year in this country while the reverse is nearly non-existent.</p>

			<p>I love to hear the usual whining about the &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; media. News people are not supposed to refer to suspects as guilty, till surprise, they are declared guilty. If they did otherwise, could you imagine how the defense would use that?</p>
