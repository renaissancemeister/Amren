<p>In a way, Mr. Machi represents the holy grail of the final push for votes in Pennsylvania: white male Democrats. As a group, they are nearly evenly divided between Senator Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama. And individually, white male Democrats express the most ambivalence about the two candidates.</p>
<p>A recent poll from Temple University in Philadelphia asked likely Democratic voters to rate the favorability of Clinton and Obama on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being most favorable. The contest was closest among white men who gave Clinton an average of 6.4 and Obama 6.9. When only voters over 30 are considered, the numbers get even tighter: 6.5 for Clinton and 6.7 for Obama.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s white women, in contrast, clearly are more enthusiastic about Clinton. They give her an average favorability of 7.8, versus 5.9 for Obama.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s up with the white guys?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more and more impressed as time goes on that this election is about which candidate you think is more like you,&rdquo; says Michael Hagen, director of Temple&rsquo;s Institute for Public Affairs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, he adds, the candidates have spent so much time in the past six weeks aiming their messages at white men &mdash; not always successfully. Obama&rsquo;s adventure in ten-pin bowling, scoring a 37 in seven frames, did not exactly impress, while images of Clinton knocking back liquor, and talking about how her dad taught her how to shoot at their Pennsylvania cottage, struck some voters as pandering.</p>
<p>In a state where many counties give schoolchildren a day off for the opening of deer-hunting season, gun rights are considered a nearly sacred matter. But Clinton&rsquo;s record as a supporter of gun control didn&rsquo;t exactly square with her attempts to come across as gun friendly.</p>
<p>It is Obama, though, who seriously risked alienating gun owners in the run up to Pennsylvania with his private comments at a San Francisco fundraiser, where he talked about &ldquo;bitter&rdquo; small-town voters who &ldquo;cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren&rsquo;t like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for now, what has been dubbed &ldquo;Bittergate&rdquo; does not seem to have hurt Obama in Pennsylvania, at least in the Democratic primary. The average of the latest polls shows him trailing Clinton by about five percentage points, which is roughly where he has been since he began advertising heavily in the state.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Both Obama and Clinton have trouble connecting with white men.</p>
<p>A statement which might better have been phrased as &#8220;connecting with THINKING White men.&#8221; Because anyone with even modicum intelligence sees Obama as a racist and a liar, as a pandering politician playing for minorities&hellip; while perceiving Hillary as also a pathological liar incapable of telling the same story two two different audiences, and seeking the presidency NOT out of a genuine desire to help Americans, but to gratify the egos of Bill Clinton and her own, in creating a Clinton Dynasty.</p>

			<p>In order to win, Democrats have to win approximately 60 percent of the white vote, not just white Democratic voters, whites in general.  That has been nearly impossible for any Democrat since the Democratic party takes such a negative stand towards whites in general, and white males in particular.  All this talk in this election cycle, and past cycles, of Reagan democrats is a misnomer, they are actually Wallace democrats.  Even with the Democrats going all out to register non-whites to vote,this will matter little in the long run.  Whites, despite our decline in the percentage of the population still cast close to 75 percent of all votes in any election.  Even in states such as CA where whites have dropped to minority status, they still cast most of the ballots.  </p>
<p>The Democratic party will most likely go down in history as having snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, no matter which of the statement making candidates win their nomination process. </p>

<p>Utterly laughable, is the sheer arrogance of this pampered mulatto pretender!</p>
<p>How reveling these words are, like his wife&rsquo;s and pastor&rsquo;s rants against white America; they say the are for &ldquo;hope&rdquo; and &ldquo;change,&rdquo; but only the most: illiterate, imbecilic, or self-deluded of the coffee house dilettantes and socioeconomic/media &ldquo;elites&rdquo; could miss this multicultural puff adder&rsquo;s real agenda. This being, ushering in a new era of anti-white and anti-freedom Euro-style &ldquo;utopianism.&rdquo; Mindless and dispiriting hive life, that  makes the Borg Collective of Star Trek look like the model of freewheeling and rugged individualism.</p>
<p>Yes indeed, a message that while cloaked in soothingly pastel platitudes and kaleidoscopically dizzying promises, offers a dreary gray reality that will be soaked in bloody Red social &ldquo;transformations.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Here is where even Hillary (wretched Marxist madwoman that she is) cannot be matched, in the Trojan Horse department; she is a known quantity, an acerbic Red gorgon that panders to the white &ldquo;fools&rdquo; she whishes to render into stone with her clumsily masked fright wig of hissing maroon vipers. Her leeringly obsequious grimace that passes for a smile and her shrill cackle, all reveal this reality of her designs. In this at least, she is genuine and reasonably &ldquo;honest,&rdquo; in spite of her best efforts to camouflage her harsher penchants.</p>
<p>But not Comrade Obama, who so &ldquo;masterfully&rdquo; plays to a media that is all too willing to make him into a saccharine demigod and benevolent dictator. But unfortunately for him (and rather too late for comfort, for the rest of us) the boils on his political buttocks have burst open and ooze their malignant juices for all to see.</p>
<p>How unfortunate for him, that white men and women who have at the very least commonsense and a love for personal freedom, recognize such burst pustules for what they are!</p>
<p>Prediction: Hillary wins PA with between 57% to 60% of the Democratic Primary vote tomorrow.<br>

			<p>With multiculturalism and crime crossing barely noticed across covered bridges, our political decisions here in the state of Pennsylvania are based more on a matter of genetics than economics or Washington politics.<br>
Sadly, the voters both men and women, dont see it that way.<br>
Men and women are overly swept up on the issue of voting in a nonwhite or female candidate at a time when it is inappropriate to do so.<br>
Globalism and multiculturalism is building unlawful and unconstitutional walls all around us and it will take alot of second thoughts and reconciliation among young people to recognize that the proper direction to thwart a looming disaster lies in simple adherence to the principles of the Constitution. <br>

			<p>Any white man who favors either of those candidates has a death wish.  With the Republicans leaving us with pro-amnesty, &#8220;100 more years in Iraq&#8221; McCain, I will be voting for some third party candidate in the general election.  It&rsquo;s as though the purpose of the Democratic and Republican primaries was to select the two worst people out of a population of 300 million.<br>

			<p>I just don&rsquo;t know.  I will vote for a 3rd party candidate but if I had to vote for one of the &#8216;big three&rsquo;  it would probably be Hussein.  Look at the other options:</p>
<p>A pathalogical liar and one half of a known criminal enterprise family who will extend the Bush-Clinton hold on the wwhite house to TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS!</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>A man who says he &#8216;knows nothing about the economy&rsquo;, promises &#8216;there will be more wars&rsquo;, pledges to stay in Iraq for &#8216;100 years&rsquo; and wants to let anyone who can get his rear accross the border citizenship.  </p>

			<p>In yesterday&rsquo;s news John McCain was down in Selma, Alabama attempting to pander to black voters there.  I am at a loss as to why this is so important while black voters are only 13% of the population and have no history of voting republican the way Hispanics or non-Hispanic Caucasian women have, but there McCain was.  I am at a similar loss as to why Caucasian males would assume that a Caucasian male candidate would be their friend.  </p>

<p>&gt; There is a lot of sad truth in your post, Bobby.  I think of that movie &#8220;No Country for Old Men&#8221; and I just replace old with white.  But there is no country for white men left on this planet it seems.  Time to dig in and stand fast no matter what comes. Go down fighting - metaphorically and literally, if it comes to that.</p>

<p>&gt; To our unknown poster, I offer these words of wisdom;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only the dead have seen the end of war&#8221; - Plato</p>
<p>And let me add my own; We have been in Germany since WW2 and we are still occupying a DMZ in Korea 60 years after that &#8220;police action&#8221; came to a truce.  It is not outlandish to imagine a U.S. military presence in Iraq or a nearby country like Kuwait for more than a 100 years, unless we fail first as a military nation, which we are very close to now.  Our future wars will most likely be fought remotely by pilotless jets, and computer nerds with hot keys, and various robotics will patrol on the ground, replacing the women (and men) who do it now.  </p>
<p>That robotic idea is not at all far-fetched.  The Japanese are working on perfecting robots to take care of their increasing number of elderly rather than let non-Japanese in the country to do it for them.  The Japanese are showing the way.  And our own military development is well on the road to robotic replacements already.  We get public glimpses here and there, but the big Area 51 type project is CLASSIFIED.  The world will soon have a shock when in about ten years an entire new &#8220;Robocop&#8221; type military is unveiled.  I don&rsquo;t know how we will pay for it, but China, India and others are sort of stuck with financing us for a long while anyway.</p>
<p>But male fertility will continue to fall worldwide.  (Which may be a good thing in the long run).<br>

			<p>Yesterday I saw on PBS a show talking about Hillary and Obama campaigning in PA.  The show was also doing an in depth analysis of Pittsburgh, in terms of the economy, demographics and so on.  The mayor there was a young white guy and he was fretting about how Pittsburgh lacks diversity. Well last time I checked, the city is about 50/50 between whites and blacks.  Anyways this guy talked about the lack of diversity as if an impending drought or earthquake was soon to hit.  Apparently the more diverse an area the more federal dollars that rain down on such an area.</p>

			<p>I see no reason to vote for any of them. It is a hobbessian choice. I would rather vote for a Libertarian candidate. Many people do not understand Libertarianism. They tend to confuse it with Libertinism, or worse, Liberalism. In fact Libertarianism is the closest form of political philosophy to what the Founding Fathers wanted for America to be.</p>

			<p>I cannot believe that with all the negative things the Democratic Party has done TO white men, that any white man would vote for a Democratic candidate.  But then again, most of the population doesn&rsquo;t have a clue on what which party did what to them.  But the Dems always raise taxes, add more social programs (which is why they raise taxes), and they continue to give everything away to minorities.  The Republicans send them to war, send their jobs overseas, and continue to give everything away to minorities.</p>
<p>I was shocked, yes shocked, that more white men did not vote for Ron Paul.  It appears white men are their own worst enemy.<br>

<p>I appreciate your thoughtful post Whiteplight, but understand;  we did not have young men from Vermont and West Virginia and North Dakota getting blown up in Berlin or Seoul 4 years after the &#8220;mission was accomplished.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Yes my friend, we are very close to failing as a military nation.  Why do you think the &#8220;oil and gas president&#8221; has allowed gas prices to increase 150% since he took office?  To pay for the war.  And these robot drones you are talking about one million dollars each!  </p>
<p>People on this website drone on about Obama giving aid to Africa, reparations and this stuff, but we still have a white US Congress, so that will not happen, at least not to any major degree.  Right now, we give more aid to Isreal than to ALL 37 AFRICAN COUNTRIES COMBINED.  Obama is a puppet, as are the other two, but not nearly as dangerous, criminal or owned.</p>

<p> Not quite sure what your point is, but, the U.S. has 302 military bases in Germany even though there is NO military threat to Germany. It maintains troops in South Korea, even though it is more then twice as populous and forty-two times wealthier then the North. It also has a huge technical lead while the North is starving. Google  a picture of the Korean peninsula at night to see the astonishing difference between the two Koreas. There is no need for an American military presence. It is simply the desire for the hegemony Washington policy makers desire for themselves (although they have no intention of actually doing any of the fighting themselves). As to the very different conditions in Berlin and Seoul four years after &#8216;Mission accomplished&rsquo; compared to Iraq, I would point out that unlike Artificial non-historic state Iraq, Korea and Germany (at least in 1949) were extremely homogeneous nation-states. The U.S. empire is going to destroy America.</p>

As I&rsquo;ve said before, elections in this country are RIGGED.</p>

			<p><i>I just don&rsquo;t know. I will vote for a 3rd party candidate but if I had to vote for one of the &lsquo;big three&rsquo; it would probably be Hussein.</i></p>
<p>The country is screwed. We&rsquo;re not going to vote our way out of the mess we&rsquo;re in. I&rsquo;m voting a straight Republican ticket from here on out. That will buy some time for the Second Amendment so that we can stockpile as many weapons as possible before the final showdown.</p>
