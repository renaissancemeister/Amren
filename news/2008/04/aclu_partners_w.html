						<p>The ACLU and Mexico&rsquo;s Commission on Human Rights have pledged to work together to protect migrants&rsquo; human rights along the U.S.-Mexico border. The groups say they&rsquo;ll challenge Operation Gatekeeper and other federal programs that put migrants&rsquo; lives in danger. KPBS reporter Amy Isackson has details.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Illegal traffic in San Diego dropped. But people continued to cross in more dangerous areas. Deaths soared.</p>
<p>Kevin Keenan is Executive Director of the ACLU in San Diego. He says the problem is not going away.</p>
<p>The ACLU and Mexico&rsquo;s Human Rights Commission plan to meet in June to determine how they&rsquo;ll challenge Gatekeeper.</p>

			<p>Little surprise there  &mdash;   left-wing organizations ganging up to subvert any enforcement efforts in Southern California.  Par for the course.</p>
<p>This is why throngs of white families are permanently leaving California, Arizona, New Mexico, lately even Texas and Florida, as these states attain a non-white majority  &mdash;   they are all already outposts of the 3rd world.  A decent number of my old friends have left these states as they&rsquo;ve become little more than gangland disaster zones and havens for criminals and vandalism.  The schools are dumbed down, and it only gets worse with each passing year.</p>
<p>Some families have just left for other states.  Many, to my surprise until recently, have been leaving the USA altogether.  They&rsquo;ve been going to Central Europe if they have ancestry there (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy mainly).  South America is increasingly popular though, especially the Big 4  &mdash;   Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay  &mdash;   which are white and non-mestizo, in fact among the most European countries on the globe.  They are almost entirely avoiding countries like Canada, the UK, Australia and Sweden, which are suffering the same kind of demographic replacement as the USA, due to the same kinds of idiotic, PC, police-state policies.  Unsurprisingly, parents in white families want to raise their children in places where we are around our own people.</p>

			<p>Any ACLU partnership to protect the civil rights of the victims of Chicano crime in the near future?  I didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t the Mexican &#8220;Commission on Human Rights&#8221; be focusing on the mistreatment of Central/South Americans illegal immigrants to Mexico? Last time I checked:<br>
* Mexican illegal immigrants weren&rsquo;t &#8220;chipped&#8221;.<br>
* Mexican illegal immigrants weren&rsquo;t raped/executed by U.S. military personnel.<br>
* Mexican illegal immigrants are allowed to protest for &#8220;their&#8221; rights.</p>
<p>This seems like another case of &#8220;clean up your backyard first, before you criticise mine&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m insane! Isn&rsquo;t the name of this organization the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union? Aren&rsquo;t they supposed to be protecting AMERICANS from having their AMERICAN civil liberties violated? </p>

			<p>As bad as the Mexicans hate blacks? Awhile back the aclu was whining that the Mexicans were running the blacks out of LA. I don&rsquo;t think this partnership will last very long.</p>

			<p>Casey James, Chileans are almost all Mestizos. They are about 20% Indian. Argentines as a nation are 19% Indian and 3% Black. Uruguayans the same. I don&rsquo;t know about Paraguay, but everyone knows that&rsquo;s a Mestizo country. Heck, an Indian language is one of the official languages.</p>

			<p>If you looked at the ACLU today without their name, you would think you were looking at a radical group that was working against this country.  So what are they really?  A radical group that is working against this country. Backing the San Diego Minutemen in their battle to pick up trash near a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint does not negate decades of a far left radical agenda.<br>

			<p>You have got to be one deluded American in not seeing what the ACLU is all about. Here is an organization that spends its time spying on Minutemen/women, who are sitting on lawn chairs drinking cola and peering through binoculars to report Mexican and other nationals violating U.S. immigration law. Or how about an organization that spends its time scrutinizing public buildings from one end of this nation to the other searching for tiny crosses on them that must be removed and that no one else but the ACLU even notices. Or how about challanging every single city across the nation by defending criminal illegal alien gangs against the poor citizens that are trying to remove them from their presence. What a wonderfull set of services they provide. Even the 18th street gang in L.A. couldn&rsquo;t do more damage.</p>

			<p>Does anyone expect any different behavior from that anti-American organization? It is as dangerous as La Raza. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very profitable for them, as it is for all the pro-illegal traitors.</p>

			<p>We have drug dealers, murderers, rapists, thieves, and terrorists from other countries that want to kill Americans crossing our unprotected borders every day.  Border agents have been killed by these illegal criminals, the drug dealers have set fires to our once beautiful National Forests simply to divert Border patrol Agents to some other part of the perimeter so they can get their drugs across easier. MS-13 gang members are building up their criminal organizations here in the U.S.A. every minute from people crossing the border illegally.  We have Islamic terrorist cells being built up here in the U.S.A. all from illegal border crossings. Not to mention ID theft, drunk driving, driving without a license or without insurance all of which are not even prosecuted anymore. Right now if illegal alien drug dealers are caught with less than 500 pounds of pot they will not be prosecuted, they will not be deported, they will be sent right back out on American streets where they can commit more crimes.<br>
    We have every right to protect our borders and the American people from this kind of criminal invasion and one organization that has been trying to stop America from protecting itself is the ACLU because they are a communist organization that has devoted itself to the destruction of America and will stop at nothing to do so. The biggest &#8220;ILLUSION&#8221; that this scam group puts upon the American people is that illegal aliens are nothing but little cutie pies that just want to make a living and be nice, well nothing could be further from the truth. I think all these so called ACLU members should be investigated by the FBI, the NSA, and CIA for their possible ties with those that wish harm to America and the American people.     <br>

			<p>A cancerous cell fools the defenses of the body into not attacking it, then uses those same bodily defenses to propagate and spread causing the death of the host organism.</p>
<p>The ACLU claims to champion the civil rights of all people.  It is now using the legal system in an effort to destroy the very culture  that spawned the concepts of universal human rights which led to organisations like the ACLU.</p>

			<p>Why isn&rsquo;t the US Government monitoring the ACLU?  It seems they do alot of things that interfere with this country&rsquo;s sovereignty, denying peoples rights and tampering with religious freedom.  They either need to be tried for treason or bankrupted by one helluva lawsuit.  </p>
