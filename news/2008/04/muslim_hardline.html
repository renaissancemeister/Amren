						<p>About 50 members of a hardline Indonesian Muslim group held a rowdy protest outside the Dutch embassy on Monday, calling for the death of a Dutch lawmaker behind a film accusing the Koran of inciting violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dozens of police, with two water cannon at the ready, did not intervene during the protest by white-clad members of the Islamic Defenders&rsquo; Front, some of whom hurled eggs and plastic water bottles into the compound of the Dutch embassy in Jakarta.</p>
<p>&#8220;I call on Muslims around the world, if you run into the maker of the film, kill him,&#8221; said one of the speakers at the rally, Awit Mashuri.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geert Wilders is a Christian terrorist,&#8221; declared a placard held up by a protester. &#8220;Kill Geert Wilders,&#8221; read another.</p>
<p>The Front is notorious for its past raids on nightspots the group accused of harbouring prostitutes and drug dealers.</p>
<p>In 2003, the group&rsquo;s leader, Mohammad Rizieq Shihab, was jailed for seven months for inciting violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far, the protests against the Dutch film have been small scale in Indonesia, the world&rsquo;s most populous Muslim nation and a former Dutch colony.<br>

			<p>This is actually very encouraging news</p>
<p>&#8220;About <strong>50 members</strong> of a hardline Indonesian Muslim group&#8221;</p>
<p>This is barely a protest.  Could it be that no one on the street cares about this film?  The only people who seem to care are the governments who have made formal protests.  </p>

			<p>Muslims! They always have to have something to feel offended about. It gives meaning to their lives. Their &#8220;religion&#8221; seems only to fill them with anger and not spiritual fulfillment.</p>

			<p>Muslims are no threat to us unless we allow them to flood into our own Christian homelands.<br>
Geert Wilders would not have to be under 24 hour protection IN HIS OWN NATIVE HOMELAND, if Muslim invaders had never been allowed to invade en masse the Netherlands in the first place.<br>

			<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>Geert Wilders did a good job - the key was to excuse the Muslims of being &#8220;violent&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thus the Muslims are put in the position of trying to refute Wilders&rsquo; charge that they are violent, so they have to put out special appeals for Muslims not to be violent.  Or else some mobs of idiot Muslims go into reflect violent riots and Geert WIlders and Whites in the West can say:</p>
<p>&#8220;See we told you so, they ever violent, very hostile to our culture. End all immigration from Muslim countries, expel the worst ones already in&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is what we need, win, win outcomes.</p>

<p>Is it me, or is it always only Muslims who repeatedly and publicly advocate murdering those who criticize their religion?</p>
<p>And could that be because, just as Geert Wilders film accurately documents, that there are instructions to followers in the Koran to do exactly that?</p>
<p>Ongoing question: Will the American media ever expose the truth about this?  </p>

			<p>Is it merely me, or do Muslims often want to kill anyone who says something they don&rsquo;t like?  If we are merely wrong in saying these things, we will be rewarded with &#8220;choice&#8221; spots in Hell, which makes decapitation seem rather tame.</p>
<p>If any of them could hold up an discussion worth a rat&rsquo;s behind, they would be talking with us.  Even some of Islam says that only a voluntary conversion is a true conversion.</p>
<p>This *must* stop.  I am not a Christian, and I was never baptised.  </p>
<p>What would a white convert to Islam be like?  Something rather like a Turk, I suspect.  Arabs are terrified of Turks, and even Persians are nervous of the Quiet Man of Europe.  If whites converted to Islam en masse, I suspect we would have religious schisms.  It won&rsquo;t ever work!  We whites are too different among ourselves.</p>

			<p>Looking through al_Jazeera&rsquo;s website recently I get the impression that the most common response, among Arab Muslims, is to call for a boycott.  It was also suggested putting together a short film documenting the horrors of the first and second world wars and America&rsquo;s use of the atomic bomb against Japan - none of which Muslims had any significant part in.  Some call for more education, among Westerners, about Islam (as they see it, of course).  A few are calling for war, but they seem to be a minority.  So, maybe I&rsquo;m missing something, but it seems to me that most Muslims realize the absurdity of reacting to &#8220;Fitna&#8221; with threats of violence and how it hurts their cause in the long run.</p>
