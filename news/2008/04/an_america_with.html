<p>The American Immigration Control Foundation has established itself as the premier publisher of trenchant monographs on immigration. Brent Nelson&rsquo;s <cite>America Balkanized</cite> is one of the best volumes on the subject now available and is a worthy successor to Lawrence Auster&rsquo;s <cite>The Path to National Suicide,</cite> published by AICF in 1990.</p>
<p>Dr. Nelson calls his book an essay on &#8220;the problems of governance in the multi-ethnic state which will arise in the United States if immigration is not curtailed.&#8221; Drawing on examples from history, current events, and even sociobiology, he argues that America&rsquo;s immigration policy cannot help but create conflicts &#8220;of such dimensions as to be insoluble within the traditional limits of American governance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many people have pointed out that massive non-white immigration could destroy the United States. Dr. Nelson&rsquo;s contribution is in articulating the principles that make destruction inevitable &mdash; if current policies continue &mdash; and in exploring some of the ways American elites deceive themselves into thinking that all is well.</p>
<p><b>North American Mammals</b></p>
<p>What could be called the leitmotif of the book comes from a surprising but persuasive source: <cite>The Mammals of North America,</cite> written by a professor of biology at the University of Kansas named Raymond Hall. This volume, which Dr. Nelson tells us is the definitive work in the field, arrives at one conclusion so emphatically that Prof. Hall italicizes in the original: <em>Two subspecies of the same species do not occur in the same geographic area.</em> Similar strains of squirrel or fox do not occupy the same ecological niche for long. Very occasionally they interbreed and produce a new subspecies, but usually one will destroy or simply displace the other.</p>
<p>Prof. Hall applies this rule to the human mammals of North America. &#8220;To imagine one subspecies of man living together on equal terms for long with another subspecies is but wishful thinking and leads only to disaster and oblivion for one or the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is very unusual to find such a categorical dismissal of attempts to create multiethnic societies. To a thoughtful biologist, however, sustained non-white immigration into the United States is a fatal violation of Nature&rsquo;s balance. Much of the conflict we see not only in the United States but around the world is the reassertion of the mammalian nature of man in the face of repeated attempts to deny it.</p>
<p>Dr. Nelson points out that it is not just the recent cheer-leaders for the &#8220;end of history&#8221; who have been tempted to ignore biology, but every classical sociological theorist from Marx and Spencer to Weber and Durkheim: &#8220;The underground survival of the ethnic factor in Eastern Europe (and elsewhere) and its sudden explosive re-emergence in separatism, irredentism, rioting, and civil war has confounded all the classical theories of sociology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike animals, human beings do not need anything so obvious as biology in order to assert group distinctions. Populations that are racially identical can fragment murderously because of religion or language.</p>
<p>Of all the world&rsquo;s peoples, it is probably only whites who ever believed that the &#8220;ethnic factor&#8221; could be made not to matter. Americans, in particular, seem to believe that heterogeneity is not the slightest obstacle to national unity, and that a nation&rsquo;s spirit can expand infinitely to accommodate all comers. Dr. Nelson quotes Jeane Kirkpatrick as follows: &#8220;Only those who do not understand America believe that families that have been here for 10 generations are more American than the tens of thousands of new citizens naturalized last year.&#8221; In other words, <em>anyone</em> can <em>instantly</em> become <em>completely</em> American.</p>
<p>Many of those tens of thousands of naturalized citizens have no such illusions. They know they bring immutable characteristics that may not affect the legal American state but that permanently change the American nation. &#8220;What color is to blacks, language is to Hispanics,&#8221; explains Maurice Ferre, former mayor of Miami. &#8220;We could come back in 100 years and the Latinos will not have assimilated in the classic sense,&#8221; says the head of the Chicano [Mexican-American] Studies Research Center at UCLA.</p>
<p>Some immigrants are openly contemptuous of the culture and history to which Mrs. Kirkpatrick seems to think they will smoothly assimilate. Ricardo Chavira, who writes for <cite>Time</cite> magazine, says: &#8220;Imagine the ludicrousness of an elementary school teacher telling a room full of Chicanos that George Washington and company were our Founding Fathers. Obviously, those guys in matching white wigs were no fathers of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Chicanos intend to follow the logic of anti-assimilation to its obvious conclusion; they fully expect steady Hispanic immigration to push whites out of the Southwest and to bring complete Hispanic domination. Although it is not clear whether the Southwest would then reattach itself to Mexico or become an independent nation, Chicanos already have a name for their nation: Aztlan, which means &#8220;the bronze continent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Nelson quotes a 1982 article in <cite>Excelsior,</cite> Mexico&rsquo;s leading daily, that anticipates the same victory:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;The territory lost in the XIX century .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seems to be restoring itself through humble people who go on settling various zones that once were ours on the old maps.
<p>&#8220;Land, under any concept of possession, ends up in the hands of those who deserve it.&#8221;</blockquote></p>
<p>White Americans are not even putting up a token resistance to reconquest; they have granted to illegal aliens all the social benefits of citizens. Dr. Nelson reports further that when the Texas legislature passed a Buy American-Buy Texan law, it treated Mexico as part of the United States. Likewise, it voted to let Mexican nationals pay in-state tuition at five Texas state universities near the border, thus establishing the principal of treating aliens better than American citizens from other states.</p>
<p>Dr. Nelson explains that as long ago as the 1960s, Chicanos realized that conquest would not require desperate measures because whites were willing partners in their own dispossession. Activists have instead opted for what they call &#8220;the long march through the institutions,&#8221; that is, establishment of Chicano Studies Departments, naturalization, seizure of majorities on school boards, and massive voter support for co-racialists.</p>
<p>Their confidence is based not just on sheer numbers but on how those numbers are distributed. In Houston, Texas, for example, Hispanics were only one fifth of the population in 1985. However, they accounted for one third of the children in the Houston School District, and <em>more than half of the first-graders.</em> Hispanics need only wait for the Southwest to fall into their hands. Before long, vast regions of the country will reflect what is now only a local phenomenon: Those who are to be &#8220;assimilated&#8221; outnumber those who are presumably to do the assimilating.</p>
<p>This demographic transformation has been greatly assisted by proponents &mdash; mostly white &mdash; of &#8220;multiculturalism.&#8221; In Dr. Nelson&rsquo;s view, former Marxists have simply rechanneled their hatred of capitalism into hatred of Western Civilization, and with equally destructive intent:</p>
<p> <blockquote>&#8220;After the transformation of America which they advocate has been effected, American civilization will no longer have its formerly European character. American civilization will have been effectively abolished.&#8221;</blockquote></p>
<p>Multiculturalism is promoted with a tremendous propaganda effort meant to convince whites that the displacement of their culture is either inevitable or is appropriate punishment for their sins.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;America Is Unique&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Dr. Nelson devotes a considerable part of his book to the question of what defines a nation. He quotes John Jay, writing in 1787 in <cite>The Federalist Papers:</cite> &#8220;Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people, a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jay recognized that these are the ties that bind nations together. Today, whites have begun to realize that America can no longer lay claim to any of the old ties. So-called conservatives, who do not share the multiculturalists zeal for the destruction of Western Civilization, find themselves in the absurd position of claiming that a third-world population can still, somehow, be &#8220;American.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than admit that the disappearance of Jay&rsquo;s common bonds means the dissolution of America, they claim that the country is uniquely exempt from the need for common bonds. What then makes America American? Dr. Nelson cites the economist Robert J. Samuelson: &#8220;Prosperity is what binds us together.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be hard to think of a more threadbare basis for national unity. No nation enjoys eternal prosperity. Its true test is adversity. By Mr. Samuelson&rsquo;s definition, the United States could not survive another depression or protracted war. It may not even survive mild recession. In Mr. Samuelson&rsquo;s terms, the United States is strictly a business interest; if it stops being profitable, it can be liquidated. Whether he knows it or not, Mr. Samuelson is admitting that America is no longer a nation.</p>
<p>The thesis of American uniqueness, to which scholars and politicians cling with increasing desperation, does have some basis in history. America did manage to blend Europeans into a cohesive nation, despite the conflicts that continued to wrack Europe. However, as Dr. Nelson points out, this blending took place under ideal circumstances. The new Americans were of the same race (or subspecies, to use Prof. Hall&rsquo;s terminology) and the Western frontier served as a safety valve for ethnic friction. Today&rsquo;s newcomers are not only racially &mdash; and therefore permanently &mdash; different, they are pouring into a nation that is increasingly crowded and exhausted.</p>
<p>The promise of American uniqueness is false. One of the signs of approaching dissolution is the extent to which the role of government has become mediation between hostile groups. The reigning theory of the last several decades has been that &#8220;tolerance,&#8221; &#8220;sensitivity,&#8221; and &#8220;openness&#8221; can bring a permanent solution to racial conflict. There is, of course, no sign of permanent solution. Dr. Nelson points out that races are &#8220;political conflict groups&#8221; that are &#8220;already pre-organized by Nature.&#8221; Racial friction is therefore an abiding addition to the normal political disagreements found even in homogeneous nations.</p>
<p>It is not as though the mainstream media are unaware of this. For example, they duly report that during one 18-month period in the town of Long Beach, California, there were 55 drive-by shootings as part of a feud between Cambodian and Hispanic gangs. Long Beach was once so overwhelmingly white it was called Iowa by the Sea. The astonishing thing is that the degeneration of a homogeneous, prosperous white city into a racial battleground for aliens does not provoke calls for the restoration of homogeneity. Instead, government takes on the increasingly futile task of papering over racial antagonisms. This is the cost of pretending that humans are not mammals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Government in a multi-ethnic state must grow ever more intrusive, ever larger, and ever more costly, simply in order to preserve the political integrity of the state,&#8221; writes Dr. Nelson. Every act of government becomes a racial juggling act, a distribution of spoils to each group according to mathematical formulae.</p>
<p>To the extent that multi-ethnic states work at all, they require the indulgence of the majority. Dr. Nelson quotes historian Hans Kohn: &#8220;Fundamental for the solution of problems of duo- or polyethnic states is not primarily the attitude of the minority or minorities but that of the majority. The weaker groups in the population must receive a greater consideration than would be proportional to their numerical strength.&#8221; Dr. Nelson notes that this is true in Switzerland, Belgium, and Canada, as well as the United States.</p>
<p>Here, the game of exploiting the majority has become so attractive that groups other than races now play it. Homosexuals, feminists, and handicapped people have all copied blacks and Hispanics and now demand special favors in the name of &#8220;victimhood.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>America Without Americans</b></p>
<p>Where will it end? Dr. Nelson predicts that as their numbers dwindle, whites will eventually demand from their leaders the racial aggressiveness typical of non-whites. It is only the nostalgic attachment of the white majority for the idea of a united America, the illusion that it is still possible to have a government that speaks for Americans of all races, that gives the country even the appearance of unity. These nostalgic illusions will be torn away by the ruthless consolidation of power by non-whites:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;When .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. European Americans begin to think of themselves as such and demand ethnically conscious European American leaders, then America will have become America Balkanized, a nation without Americans, just as Yugoslavia, in the early 1990s, became a nation without Yugoslavs; i.e. no longer a viable nation.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>Awakened white consciousness may not come for several decades. Because America &mdash; with its forms, its trappings of government, its national symbols and slogans &mdash; derives almost exclusively from European sources, whites will be the last to abdjure the realm and abandon the current notion of what America is supposed to be. They will cling to the image of an &#8220;inclusive,&#8221; &#8220;tolerant,&#8221; all-absorbing America &mdash; but only at their peril. No one else plays by those rules. As Prof. Hall reminds us, any attempt by two human subspecies to live side by side &#8220;leads only to disaster and oblivion for one or the other.&#8221;<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a little late to be talking about reforming immigration to save America, about 20 years too late.  The White government has allowed non-whites to reach critical mass and process is most likely irreversible now.  Congratulations to the pot smoking, bra burning, flower power 60s generation for your considerable part in destroying my nation. </p>

			<p>I always put the blame of white blindness to their eventual<br>
ethnic cleansing is to the mass media that will not tell the<br>
truth. It seems that the mass media is controlled by a small<br>
group of wealthy elite, that is promoting a agenda of destruction<br>
of western civilization, and promote a police state, in which<br>
the majority of the people are treated as cattle.<br>
I lived in Long Beach in California that went from a 90% white<br>
city, with the best schools in the nation, and a low crime rate.<br>
To a multi ethnic. and multiracial city with a every rising<br>
crime rates, and the schools are full of turmoil. And ethnic<br>
gangs battle for control of the streets. If this is the future<br>
of America, than America is on her death bed., and there is no<br>
hopeful future.</p>

<p>This is an interesting point, or an interesting articulation of an idea we are already all familiar with. What do those who have &#8220;transcended&#8221; race propose we put in the stead of blood-language-community ties? Really just two things. Ideas / The State. </p>
<p>We have some ideas. Admittedly poor ones which can&rsquo;t stand critical review. We have a powerful and enormously centralized State. Admittedly a poor one in terms of how its organized and who leads it. The powers of ideas + state will keep 300 million people united?</p>
<p>The above paragraph gives an answer: only as long as prosperity holds. Now let me put things in terms even an absolutist could understand: if the worth of the U.S. dollar is a cookie, and the Iraq war is Cookie Monster&hellip; </p>

			<p>Not that Anglo-America wasn&rsquo;t warned many times, by many visionaries (foreign and domestic), about this onrushing racial disaster. What did the self-blinded Anglos do when the chips were down? They killed or demonized those trying to racially reason with them, of course. The smug, know-it-all white Anglo bunnies dove headlong into the inter-racial swamp anyway. The voluntary demise of the white lemmings should be seen for what it really is; the suicide of a people who whorshipped delusions.</p>

			<p>The 1965 Immigration act was the greatest mistake ever. It will lead to the dissolution of America because it will lead to the dissolution of the basic racial group that created America. Nor does it help matters that Mexico has irredentist views.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Very occasionally they interbreed and produce a new subspecies, but usually one will destroy or simply displace the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bio-sourcebook leaves two possibilities.  Species may prevail over each other, or they may breed a union of strength.  I believe in the latter.  There is a lot of talk about &#8220;demography being destiny&#8221; that by 2050 whites will live in country where they are the minority, but this is an inaccurate representation of the future which assumes the divisions of race will still be as stark as the classification distance between &#8220;subspecies.&#8221;  We will no longer think of a person as a member of a race but the product of hyphenated stock, and the concept of a majority will be extinguished.  </p>
<p>I have seen the intermarriage numbers for the non-white American born. If immigration is now severely curtailed, these numbers will predict the future.  Blacks will very slowly but eventually widely intermarry (black-white intermarriage is quite low).  But, the children of new immigrants will create new homogeneity.  Their intermarriage rates go as high as 35% and 45%, Asians males and females under the age of 30, respectively.  I know America won&rsquo;t Balkanize if we can better control immigration because we, the American people, are destined to be a mongrel race.      </p>

			<p>Agree with above. Maybe USA should build a monument to Ted Kennedy and all those who helped legislate USA into extinction.<br>
I have been helplessly watching the self destruction of my race since 60&rsquo;s.  Few have the courage to speak out for US because the government betrayed its&rsquo;original race for the &#8216;so called&rsquo; civil rights of others.  I really believe the governments will execute whites because they want to return to indentured servitude/ surf system.  By marginalizing natives to millions of immigrants the government has effective made US meaningless. <br>
It appears 5th column ownes USA now.   I know other races have deep hatred to me. I have experienced it hundreds of times!  V</p>

<p>As long as productive Whites keep paying the tab for dysfunctional nonwhites, there will be an uneasy truce.  An ever increasing pool of unproductive nonwhites coupled with a shrinking pool of working Whites is a recipe for disaster.  </p>

			<p>The decline in America will be a gradual process. According to the US Census, Whites will be a minority in this country by 2050. As that time approaches, we will see more and more minority being elected to local, state and federal offices. If you are a rich elitist, with your gated communities and private schools, you should be all right for awhile, until the government starts raising your taxes to pay for all its social program, since you will be their only source of revenue. The White middle class will have no more suburbs to flee to. They will see their children interbreeding and becoming part of the rising minority. </p>
<p>Probably the last remaining White people will be a bunch of good old boys, rednecks, hillbillies and bubbas living on the fringes of society, just out or reach of a minority ran government. </p>
<p>Welcome to the United States, the new Detroit.</p>

			<p>This racial situation is basically whites vs whites. When I<br>
am forced to attend diversity training, whom do I see that is<br>
promoting diversity is whites. They mainly go after the whites<br>
in the class to see if they have any racial feelings, and are<br>
anyway antagonistc anyway to racial diversity, third world<br>
immigration, and economic, and social powers to the non whites<br>
that are less qualified, and are encouraged in promoting their<br>
agendas in bringing in more of their people into the country<br>
irregardless of the consequences. Also, whom are the promoters<br>
of mass immigration, are whites, for a mythical diversity,<br>
cheap labor, and votes, that they think will keep them in<br>
perpetual power. These whites will always lie, distort reality,<br>
and pursue a agenda promoted as religious doctrine.<br>
We have to wait until the situation becomes so horrible, and<br>
and that the consequences can no longer be cover it. When it<br>
becomes whites vs non whites, will the situation change for<br>
the better. It is because the non whites will welcome whites<br>
to lead, because of their horrible conditions caused by the<br>
the diversity crowd.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Of all the world&rsquo;s peoples, it is probably only whites who ever believed that the &ldquo;ethnic factor&rdquo; could be made not to matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an excellent article, but I&rsquo;d have to take exception here by agreeing to what he says only if he alters his statement to say that &#8220;it is probably only SOME whites&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>There are millions of us who know full well this nonsense of multiculturalism is absolute insanity that will never work for any appreciable length of time.</p>
<p>I could say further, that many of us believe that it isn&rsquo;t necessary to use force to wipe out this silly agenda, because it will implode all by itself.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;When &hellip; European Americans begin to think of themselves as such and demand ethnically conscious European American leaders, then America will have become America Balkanized, a nation without Americans, just as Yugoslavia, in the early 1990s, became a nation without Yugoslavs; i.e. no longer a viable nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seems to be saying that Whites should not be racially conscious because it will end America while nonwhites are very racially motivated and will eventually disolve America all by themselves.  I agree with poster at 12:32 PM on April 12.  It is our own people that put us the situation we&rsquo;re in.   <br>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Only those who do not understand America believe that families that have been here for 10 generations are more American than the tens of thousands of new citizens naturalized last year.&rdquo; In other words, anyone can instantly become completely American.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are two things about the West and the USA that make it special, unique.  </p>
<p>1- Spiritual Growth, and it&rsquo;s result, </p>
<p>2- The Soveriegn Individual</p>
<p>Two other things that not only oppose the above two, but, if permitted to grow can actually work to destroy them, are found in the above quote from a high-ranking Government offical no less; those two things are, </p>
<p>1- A Culture of Over-simplification</p>
<p>2- Instant Gratification</p>
<p>World History moves irresistably in the direction of growth and individuality, and those two can ONLY flourish in a Democratic society.  Does anyone REALLY think that abolishing the notions of spiritual growth, individuality and Democracy is automatically going to improve a persons lot in life, or Mankinds place in World History?</p>

			<p>&#8220;I know America won&rsquo;t Balkanize if we can better control immigration because we, the American people, are destined to be a mongrel race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Moderate Multiculturalist at 1:08 AM on April 12</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson thought differently. He believed that it was the DESTINY of proud, White European Protestants to subdue the entire continent of North America and maintain their racial purity forever. Since this is the scenario that I favor, I&rsquo;ll explain why I think your ridiculous scenario is wrong. </p>
<p>Firstly, your scenario assumes that the process will be very gradual, but it most certainly won&rsquo;t be. Among other things, for the situation to unfold gradually we would need unending prosperity, but that it not going to be the case. At least on the surface, Americans are still essentially a wealthy people, but economic trends will change this in the future. When that happens, the empty slogans of our moronic liberal journalists and plutocrats won&rsquo;t matter anymore. &#8216;Celebrate Diversity&rsquo;, &#8216;Race is only Skin-Deep&rsquo;, etc.   &mdash;   These will be of absolutely no significance when America is FINALLY tested with challenging conditions. So far, we&rsquo;ve had it VERY easy, as this article clearly illustrates. Only a country that is drowning in wealth has the necessary amount of leisure time to delude itself to such an extreme extent.</p>
<p>Your dates are also wrong, which is another reason why you&rsquo;re conclusion doesn&rsquo;t follow. White Americans won&rsquo;t be a minority by 2050, they will be a minority MUCH EARLIER. Realistically, if you only include those who are WHOLLY European and of sound racial stock, White Americans will be a minority within the next decade. In other words, in terms of numbers, the scenario in store for us won&rsquo;t develop as gradually as you imply, because crisis will already be here before the White race in America can be slowly extinguished. </p>
<p>Plus, in the end, even a large amount of our race is lost through mongrelization, that&rsquo;s not really consequential for the White race to prevail. In the long-term, the only thing that really matters is that a select PORTION of our race survives and eventually manages to secure its existence for good, both physically and spiritually. And, given the fact that the &#8216;mongrel race&rsquo; you describe wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to maintain our level of civilization, it is highly unlikely that the best of our race will be foolish enough to sacrifice theit racial purity once they realize that this path of mongrelization will result in a nightmarish future. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Species may prevail over each other, or they may breed a union of strength. I believe in the latter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Races, (or anything else for that matter), do not breed a &#8220;union of strength&#8221;. They only result in a mediocre mongrel race with no particular strength, only shadows of the races that made it up. A liger is superior to neither a lion or a tiger, it is only a hybrid anomaly that is not suited for any environment. The colors of the rainbow don&rsquo;t combine to make more vibrant reds, blues, or greens, but rather a muddy, brackish color. There has not been a single case in history where the hybrids have excelled over both of the parent populations.</p>

			<p>Dr. Nelson quotes Jeane Kirkpatrick as follows: &ldquo;Only those who do not understand America believe that families that have been here for 10 generations are more American than the tens of thousands of new citizens naturalized last year.&rdquo; In other words, anyone can instantly become completely American.<br>
Many of those tens of thousands of naturalized citizens have no such illusions. &#8221; (from paragraph 9)</p>
<p>They have other illusions&hellip;.all of them extensions of the corrupt thinking they practice within their own cultures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land, under any concept of possession, ends up in the hands of those who deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bogus sense of entitlement.</p>
<p>Ricardo Chavira, who writes for Time magazine, says: &ldquo;Imagine the ludicrousness of an elementary school teacher telling a room full of Chicanos that George Washington and company were our Founding Fathers. Obviously, those guys in matching white wigs were no fathers of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Radical Ingratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their confidence is based not just on sheer numbers but on how those numbers are distributed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rigid dependence on a consensus reality. Which of course goes hand in hand with their disdain for freedom of speech, spiritual growth and individuality. There is nothing of quality to them, they are sheer quantity.</p>
<p>Posts Conclusion:</p>
<p>These are not simply &#8220;low-trust&#8221; cultures.  These are Psychopathic cultures.  These are a people enmeshed in pathology; no conscience, no boundries, no shame, no humility.  <br>
They are not winning, we are losing.  <br>
If you were a man on the moon looking at the planet Earth you could literally see the spreading of this cancer.  We need to develop the strength, and the anti-bodies, to withstand surgery without anesthesia. </p>

			<p>Whites are only ones who will carry Western Civilization forward.  Without Western Civilization the United States will be nothing but a corrupt sewer of a nation.  Whites need to cluster in areas where they are solidly in control of their own local governments and schools.</p>
<p>One factor perhaps not noted in Dr. Nelson&rsquo;s 1994 book in the role of most businesses now pushing for mass immigration so they can have cheap labor and more consumers for their products.  Do not these business owners have families, or are they not aware of the deterioration of this nation due to mass immigration???</p>
<p>One could not have previously conceived of the US Chamber of Commerce as being a hostile organization to the future of this nation, but they are now.</p>

			<p>Going back as far as Democracy in America there has been only two options for America: either widespread miscegenation and the formation of a new, mulatto race or an open race war.  Racial mixing has its limits and is practiced mostly by the lower rung of whites in terms of socio-economic class and IQ.  I doubt that blacks and whites will ever form a new race.  The other alternative seems to me much more likely, especially as the economy enters into what will be known as Depression II. </p>
<p> Many types of nonsense are permitted when a society is very affluent which will not be permitted when it finds itself out of economic options.  Yes, the Fed will continue in the near future to print money to solve all economic problems and the Japanese and Chinese will continue to purchase US debt(treasury notes) but eventually the Fed will create hyperinflation and our Asian friends will no longer purchase worthless pieces of paper.</p>
<p>It may well be that all that holds America as it exists today is prosperity.  Such an America, however, does not deserve to exist and will very quickly disappear once the prosperity is gone.  The America of Bill Clinton, Al Gore and all the ex-hippies cannot last and will soon be forced to declare itself bankrupt.  When that happens, the entire superstructure of the racial spoils system will collapse for the simple reason that it will no longer be possible to pay for it.  </p>
<p>Then you will see riots across the country by millions of the underclass who have survived, even thrived, for many generations on government hand outs.  The fact that this class is extremely violent and lacks any sense of morality will only make the collapse of the inner cities more destructive.  White Americans will see the reality of the black underclass in color on their TV sets as it implodes and we will essentially have a race war which will make all previous wars look tame by comparison.</p>
<p>  What will happen in the end?  In the end America will be increasingly  balkanized along racial lines.  There will be prosperous white zones and Haiti-like poverty in the new Black America.  There will be no interaction of any kind between the two, except for the occasional boundary dispute which will be settled by force of arms.  The SouthWest may be reoccupied by Mexicans who will turn it into another Mexico, with all that goes with that transformation.  Yet, ultimately, whites will be much better off than they are at present.  They will have survived as a race and they will have solved the problem of having to live with blacks for there will be no blacks in the white enclaves after CWII.</p>
<p>All of these things will likely happen in our lifetimes, i.e. in the next 20-30 years.  They are not just fantasy  &mdash;  -if you doubt me, then wait and see.</p>

			<p>The situation in Canada is even worse than the USA, insofar as there seem to be SOME American Whites who are realists and see the onrushing demographic disaster in their nation. In Canada, with our hate crimes laws, state and media indoctrination of Whites from birth, use of the raw power of the state to crush any lingering dissent from White dissidents (in the form of various Commisions and Tribunals who enforce the PC dogma) and the consequent loss of free speech (for Whites only), the White population is so brainwashed, so passive, that they are completely unaware of the onrushing multi-culti train that is about to smash them out of existance.</p>

			<p>Does anyone else wonder if our President has a clue about the ravages that illegal immigration leaves in its wake? Does he know about the schools full of non-English speaking students when he pushes his &#8220;no child left behind&#8221; agenda. Does he visit the barrios in the US with the graffeti and gang members who are injuring and killing law-abiding citizens? Does he see the quiet desperation of men who worked at low-skilled jobs being replaced by illegal aliens because they work cheaper? Does he see the unemployed middle class whose jobs have been outsourced or insourced? Does he see Americans who have to choose between food or medicine? Does he see our paychecks shrink when part of it goes to the upkeep of lawbreakers who don&rsquo;t even belong here? Does he see the misery of this nation as it is daily invaded while our leaders do the bare minimum for photo ops? Watch out, Jimmy Carter, you&rsquo;d better get busy if you&rsquo;re to keep the title of the &#8220;worst President.&#8221; W. is breathing down your neck.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The White government has allowed non-whites to reach critical mass and process is most likely irreversible now.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I beg to differ&hellip; we have NOT YET reached critical mass. But once we, do, expect the inevitable explosion. Probably manifesting itself with at first sporadic, than continually escalating outbursts of anti-immigrant violence. The destruction of minority-owned businesses and property, finally, in outright bloodshed.</p>
<p>An unlikely scenario?  Look at it THIS way&hellip; you can only push Americans so far. Sooner or later, someone, maybe a LOT of people are going to start pushing back. Granted there have been acts of anti-immigrant violence in our history. But there has NEVER been as much immigration a century ago, either. When the explosion does happen, the only sure thing is that a lot of Americans are going to wade in and do their part. The premise being that if we can&rsquo;t depend on our government to act on behalf of the collective will of the people, we&rsquo;ll just have to act on our own behalf.</p>
<p>But I suspect there are a lot of Europeans, Australians who still understand how easy it is to improvise weapons, if you&rsquo;re pushed far enough. Then count me in, too!</p>

<p>I absolutely do believe you, however, I hope it&rsquo;s not as violent as you envision.  There is massive White flight across the country, out of California and the Southwest and the black majority cities.  We just need to stay clear of them and when the entitlements stop, they&rsquo;ll only have each other to kill.</p>

			<p>&#8220;They will cling to the image of an &ldquo;inclusive,&rdquo; &ldquo;tolerant,&rdquo; all-absorbing America &mdash; but only at their peril. No one else plays by those rules. As Prof. Hall reminds us, any attempt by two human subspecies to live side by side &ldquo;leads only to disaster and oblivion for one or the other.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what twelve years of public school indoctrination at the hands of modern liberals can accomplish. The entire dismanteling of a culture and possibly a country in this case.</p>
