						<p>The Department of Homeland Security has ceased operating its virtual fence near Tucson Arizona because of complaints by Border Patrol officers.  The 28-mile fence had been touted as a high-tech way to detect and capture hundreds of illegal immigrants that cross the area every day, but the system couldn&rsquo;t quickly alert officers to the crossing.  Furthermore, DHS complained that the remote controlled cameras could be turned quickly enough.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The prototype &ldquo;wall&rdquo; consisted of nine 98-foot tall towers dotting a 28-mile section southwest of Tucson (Sasabe to be exact).  Each tower had several infrared and regular high definition cameras that were triggered by radar and seismic sensors.  The system was supposed to wirelessly transmit photos of crossers to Border Patrol officers, but in many cases the alerts were sent too late or not at all.</p>
<p>There were also reports that the cameras moved too slowly which helped illegal crossers and smugglers get away.  While the DHS says the prototype helped catch 3000 people since December, that is a small fraction of the estimated several hundred people that cross the same area daily.</p>
<p>Of course a tower sitting in the middle of the desert would prove to be a juicy target (hey it&rsquo;s my tower now!) so Boeing installed a six-foot high chain-link fence around each tower.  The company also posted private guards at the towers.  However, the New York Times reported last year that they were able to simply walk up to one of the towers unopposed and apparently unnoticed. </p>

			<p>I believe East Germany/the Soviet Union had a vastly more effective wall - all the &#8220;high technology&#8221; needed were automated machine guns, guard units, landmines and a &#8220;No Man&rsquo;s Land&#8221; between the Wall.</p>
<p>I recall that, in it&rsquo;s 40 year reign, only somewhere along the lines of 100 persons escaped to the other side.</p>
<p>Seriously, the only thing that&rsquo;ll hold the &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; back is the *threat of death*, not some highly-convoluted &#8220;21st Century technological wall&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Perhaps we can persuade the two Koreas to unite, and then we could buy their border defenses for cheap.  We could even hire some of the guards.  They won&rsquo;t flinch from the trigger, and they&rsquo;ll work cheaper than Blackwater&rsquo;s mercenaries.  There we go, a real immigration compromise, something for the pro-immigration crowd, the free traders, and for us.  </p>

			<p>Let me suggest something far cheaper and far more effective&hellip; Like sowing a HALF BILLION anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines in a broad strip along the border. Once a few dozen illegals get maimed or killed, the infiltrating will stop.</p>

<p>My thoughts exactly as it relates to use of land mines to secure our borders. I would also add that land mines would be equally effective at reducing the losses that Syrian/Iranian insurgents are inflicting upon our troops in Iraq.</p>
<p>What your elegant solution demonstrates is that we do not lack the means only that we lack the will to do what is required.  Regrettably, this is becoming the hallmark of our once great republic.</p>

			<p>As if the government really wanted to stop them. Let&rsquo;s face it, the fix is in. A virtual fence for a virtual border is about as serious as it will ever get.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh we will build a fence..but it wont be like a fence..it wont keep anyone actually out..so we dont have to call it anything offensive like &#8220;wall&#8221; or &#8220;fence&#8221;. That way everyone will be happy&hellip;&#8221; </p>

			<p>The elites that champion illegal immigration don&rsquo;t live in virtual mansions, and aren&rsquo;t protected by virtual bodyguards.  They don&rsquo;t care for virtual European cars either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s plainly obvious to all by now that continued government foot-dragging on this issue is deliberate.  Instead of going with the tried and tested solid wall, they opt for dubious high-tech solutions that allow the same number of illegals to cross while funnelling tens of millions to defense contractors.</p>

			<p>Want to know the &#8220;market&#8221; solution to the illegal immigration problem?  Heavily fine and imprison American CEO&rsquo;s and HR managers who are turning a blind eye to the illegal status of their employees.  If you locked up for two years a few hundred of these people the jobs would dry up overnight and the illegals would go home on their own accord. </p>
<p>I am not against a fence but it is obvious that neither the present Republican of Democratic parties will ever build it. The new globalist elites control both our political parties.  That is why eight years of Clinton and eight years of Bush produced the same result on the border. The question is how do we call these traitors to our Nation to account?  What should we do?  They obviously despise the average American and have no fear that we will be able to stop their insultingly transparent destruction of our national sovereignty. </p>
<p>The only party that even gives lip service to the concerns of nationalist conservatives has given us a miserable candidate in Senator McCain.  A man who has absolutely no intention of building a wall and has the gall to say we should be happy that our latest big defense contract (refueling aircrafts) was given to a French company because it will &#8220;save&#8221; the taxpayers money.  Save us by furthering the destruction of our industrial base.  Save us by spending tax payer dollars overseas instead of paying wages to American workers.  Save us by destroying us. Do the county a favor and stay home in November.  Don&rsquo;t let the Republican party keep pissing on conservatives.  Better to have four years of Obama or Clinton than to support false friends who smile in our faces while stabbing us in the back.  They think they don&rsquo;t have to stop the immigration problem because they are the only game in town.  So stop playing their game.  Stay home and make the Republican Party start taking us serious.</p>

			<p>Everyone involved knew it would be useless.  It&rsquo;s just that Boeing probably leaned on one of the senators in its pocket to deliver $20 million cash in tax payer money.  For Congress, it&rsquo;s a win-win: temporarily quell voter discontent, AND guarantee campaign cash for a re-election campaign.  </p>

			<p>The Federal Gov&rsquo;t hasn&rsquo;t done anything serious to stop illegal immigration for decades.  Nearly every program has had a fatal flaw.  I for one, think these programs are either being designed to fail or sabotaged in some manner.  The &#8216;are not able to buy something off the shelf&rsquo;, they &#8216;have to&rsquo; design something special.  The decide what they want a program to do, announce specifications, make a contract, and about half way in make changes.  Then &#8216;it doesn&rsquo;t work the way it was designed&rsquo;.  Surprise.</p>
<p>It is how many years after 9/11 and they still cannot track people leaving?  Come on, how hard can that be?</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m disgusted.</p>

			<p>Re: the comments above about the global elites and their corporate cronies.</p>
<p>A huge problem facing the west is its symbiotic relationship with the corporate entity. Our economy has become dependent on this beast. Why this is contributing to our downfall is the very nature of the corporate structure: When you have an entity with the legal status of a &#8220;person&#8221; but lacking the &#8220;person&#8220;&#8216;s accountability and governed by board that is answerable only to shareholders, many of which are corporate entities/holding companies themselves, all of whom DEMAND capital gains and dividends or else a restructuring of board of directors via a shareholder vote, you have the recipe for disaster. <br>
Think about it, as a director/manager your choices are appease demanding shareholders and keep you job, maintain your standard of living, family etc, but betray your country and people, along the way by helping push bills that are to the detriment of the nation for example&hellip;or be a patriot but lose your position, maybe your wife and kids etc. <br>
The corporate entity is neither good or evil, it has one directive - generating profits, and when jobs and careers are at stake, unfortunately many of those who are betraying our interests are opting for what they perceive as &#8216;little&rsquo; evils, for their own greater good.<br>

			<p>Of course these schemes are being designed to fail.  Does anyone really believe that a country that could land a man on the moon is somehow incapable of building a fence?</p>
