						<p>Nearly 100 people have been questioned about their citizenship status in Prince William County since a crackdown on illegal immigration went into effect a month ago, Police Chief Charlie T. Deane told supervisors yesterday.</p>
<p>Most of the checks have occurred during traffic stops and calls for service, Deane said. Forty-one of the 89 people whom officers questioned were arrested on various charges and taken to the county&rsquo;s adult detention center.</p>
<p>Deane&rsquo;s report was the first that the Board of County Supervisors has received about the stepped-up enforcement since it began March 3.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prince William has detained almost 700 people since July, when the county began implementing federal immigration laws. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is supposed to pick up detainees within 72 hours, but there has been a two- to three-week lag time, said Prince William Police Maj. Peter Meletis.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order for it to work inside the jail, ICE has to do its part,&#8221; said Meletis, superintendent of the jail. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t have the budget or manpower to keep up with the amount of people we are detaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark X. McGraw, deputy special agent of the Washington field office for ICE, said the agency can&rsquo;t handle the influx of arrested suspects.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve gotten ahead of ourselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we are doing the best we can. We never expected that to happen as fast as it did.&#8221; Jail officials could not provide the outcomes of the cases of the 41 people arrested.</p>

			<p>Good to hear, but still, they have to speed up the deportation process to stop the immivasion promptly.  Eisenhower&rsquo;s policy of sending the illegals over the ocean and into the heart of Mexico was a good idea too, a lot better than dumping them at the border.</p>

			<p>ICE is pathetic.  They could have surrounded millions on May 1 a couple of years ago.  Why not?  They whine about catching a few:  ok, deputize every single retired military/cop/etc. and give them $100 for every illegal they arrest.  Put them in the closed military bases where the Katrina crowd was held, and bring in the cargo planes.  That&rsquo;s it.  Nothing more. Just do it.</p>

			<p>And what is the cost per deportation?..police time, jail space, judge and courtroom costs, appeals appeals appeals, lawyers lawyers lawyers&hellip;and finally (maybe) transportation to Mexico costs? And then comes the media with the nightly sob stories of the broken families left behind in USA etc etc etc. The vote whore politicians that will exploit the situation by promising to end the Gestapo tactics&hellip;and on and on and on</p>
<p>Once you let them in its all over.</p>

			<p>It would seem that ICE is doing its best to undermine the crackdown.   Secretary Chertoff has demonstrated over the years that his marching orders from Bush is to defeat efforts to deport illegals in every way he can, the fence, the roundup, etc.  </p>

Wow!  A whole forty-one!  Astounding. They&rsquo;re inundated with so many arrestees.  This is really overdoing it.  Poor ICE just can&rsquo;t handle them all..   No doubt will have to cut back soon.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;ICE says it can&rsquo;t handle the influx of arrestees.</p>
<p>Translatable to: George W. Bush, through his staff, ORDERED ICE to drag its collective feet every which way possible to keep from actually rounding up and deporting illegals. (Payback to those corporate honchos who channeled corporate contributions into his campaigning four years back.)</p>
<p>Now you understand WHY so many of us refer to him as Lying George Bush. He could give lessons in straight-faced lying to BOTH Clinton AND Obama   &mdash;   he&rsquo;s that good at it.</p>

			<p>We cannot allow amnesty of the 20 - 30 million illegal aliens in this country.</p>
<p>If we do, there will be 30, 40 or 50 million more next time, demanding the same freebies.</p>
<p>Just say &#8220;NO!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Take away their jobs, housing, welfare, medical, anchor babies, education, and food stamps, and they will leave and stop coming on their own.</p>
<p>Anti-&#8220;anchor baby&#8221; legislation is probably the single most important piece of legislation we need to get passed in this country.</p>
<p>The only thing more important than that, is getting an Executive Presidential Order for a total moratorium on all immigration, legal and illegal.</p>
<p>Enough is enough&hellip; we have to put a stop to this stuff, before the country is swamped, and if McCain is elected, we&rsquo;ll have to twist his arm till it gets done.</p>
