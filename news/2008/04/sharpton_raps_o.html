						<p>Barack Obama made a call for nonviolence in the aftermath of the Sean Bell verdict &mdash; infuriating the Rev. Al Sharpton, who accused the presidential candidate of trying to &#8220;grandstand in front of white people,&#8221; sources told The Post.</p>
<p>During what a source described as a &#8220;heated&#8221; phone call yesterday, Sharpton told Obama he was disappointed with the Illinois senator&rsquo;s words on Friday, when Obama said &#8220;resorting to violence to express displeasure&#8221; was &#8220;completely unacceptable and counterproductive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[Obama] issues this statement and not a single rock had been thrown,&#8221; said a source. &#8220;How does the candidate of change ask people to accept a verdict that is unjust?&#8221;</p>
<p>The source said Sharpton had hoped Obama would &#8220;side with the Bell family&#8221; and not use it as an &#8220;opportunity to grandstand in front of white people.&#8221;</p>

											<p>
							<i>Verena Dobnik, AP, April 27, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Hundreds of angry people marched through Harlem on Saturday after the Rev. Al Sharpton promised to &#8220;close this city down&#8221; to protest the acquittals of three police detectives in the 50-shot barrage that killed a groom on his wedding day and wounded two friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;We strategically know how to stop the city so people stand still and realize that you do not have the right to shoot down unarmed, innocent civilians,&#8221; Sharpton told an overflow crowd of several hundred people at his National Action Network office in the historically black Manhattan neighborhood. &#8220;This city is going to deal with the blood of Sean Bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharpton was joined by the family of 23-year-old Sean Bell &mdash; a black man &mdash; and a friend of Bell who was wounded in the 2006 shooting outside a Queens strip club. Two of the three officers charged were also black.</p>
<p>The rally at Sharpton&rsquo;s office was followed by a 20-block march down Malcolm X Boulevard and then across 125th Street, Harlem&rsquo;s main business thoroughfare, where some bystanders yelled out &#8220;Kill the police!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut it down! Shut it down!&#8221; the crowd chanted, standing up and applauding wildly.</p>
<p>Sharpton didn&rsquo;t say exactly how they would protest the acquittals of the officers who fired the 50 shots. He said Bell&rsquo;s supporters could demonstrate all over the city, from Wall Street to the home of Justice Arthur Cooperman, who on Friday acquitted the three detectives after a nonjury trial.</p>

			<p>What we are seeing is a prime example that blacks have a tough time succeeding at anything as a group. They just can&rsquo;t agree about anything. When this happens the situation quickly esculates into violence. This is why African countries and American ghettos often prove deadly to those living there.</p>

			<p>This is a typical black response to a legal ruling that they do not like, riot and close down a city so that people can loot decent business owners. I would venture to say that this is the reason that people like OJ Simpson get away with murder, city officials do not want their cities burnt down. </p>

			<p>Lol&hellip;.the real issue here is Sharpton is calling for violence.  And he doesn&rsquo;t appreciate Obama interfering with his incitement to riot.</p>
<p>Sharpton should be thrown in prison over this.  What he is doing is a serious crime.</p>

			<p>Uh oh, could this be the beginning of the end for Obama&rsquo;s quest to be authentic.  What a quandary be accused of being an Uncle Tom by Al Sharpton or staying at number eight on the blog &ldquo;Stuff White People Like&rdquo; What to do, what to do. </p>
<p>Another observation, isn&rsquo;t interesting that both the Reverend Al and Rush Limbaugh are dreaming of riots. </p>

			<p>Below is a link to contact NYPD.  Please do so and press them that the last time Sharpton inticed a riot in NYC, a young man named Yankel Rosenbaum was murdered by a gang incited by Sharpton.  His recent threats to &#8216;shut NYC down&rsquo; could very likely result in another murder.  </p>
<p>Tell the NYPD that you plan on visiting the city, or frequently visit, and his threats have stopped you.  I&rsquo;ve asked NYPD to please arrest Sharpton for inciting rioting, and violence, and to please, PLEASE keep NYC citizens safe from another Sharpton death.</p>

			<p>As typical, when a court decision is made based on the facts, as opposed to the lies that always fly rampant in the black racist community, then the marches, intimidations, and threats go into full swing. Sharpton led his lynch mob on a march while members of the mob chanted &#8220;Kill the cops!&#8221;. He is planning to bring his mob to the home of the very brave judge. This is a typical example of black racist mob interference with and intimidation of the judicial process. Now that brave judge&rsquo;s life and his family&rsquo;s lives are being put at risk thanks to Sharpton. (How is that legal?) It does not help the inflammatory coverage by the media: e.g. &#8220;unarmed groom shot 50 times by cops&#8221; instead of &#8220;cops shoot at suspects (with criminal records) who were running them down with a car&#8221;. <br/>
We always hear the name &#8220;David Duke&#8221; being used as synonymous with a racist. David Duke has said some terrible stuff. But Sharpton has said far worse, and, unlike David Duke, has destroyed lives and fomented racial violence and murder. So I propose that the name &#8220;Al Sharpton&#8221; start being used as synonymous with a racist instead. Read the following and consider that this despicable creature, with blood on his hands, is given respectability by prominent Democrats and is pandered to even by Bill O&rsquo;Reilly who somehow believes that smoozing up to a black racist will help immunize him against leftists who call him &#8220;racist&#8221; (like who cares, since leftists call anyone they disagree with &#8220;racist&#8221;).<br/>

			<p>Only lower IQ people like blacks would follow idiots like Sharpton. What sane people would allow this mental case to represent them but anytime something happens, real or fake, there he is &#8216;speaking&rsquo; for the family or whoever has the camera on them. Well, hearing him speak and observing his behavior and majority blacks response to him, we can see why africa isn&rsquo;t doing well. They are all a bunch of lo IQs led by out of control Sharptons.</p>

			<p>Only in the black community could someone such as Sharpton become a national leader and spokesman, the one constant throughout Sharpton&rsquo;s career is that he has always been wrong.</p>

			<p>The blame for the death of Sean Bell can be laid directly at the feet of the black community who, as a whole, is a community far too violent where the police who work in that environment have to be ready to shoot at every second of every day they are on duty, especially late at night outside a strip club. The police in a majority white town would never act like this because it is an entirely different environment with few if any shootings. Idiots like Sharpton only want to look at issues like this in a vacuum, that a black was killed who had no gun, but it&rsquo;s not that simple at all. To be a cop in a black urban area can be like being a professional soldier in a war zone and we all need to understand the mental impact that stress like that has on the police. So long as the black community remains so violent, blacks have no right to even complain when the police overreact due to the tremendous stress they are placed in every single day. Does Sharpton have to risk his life to earn a living? </p>

			<p>History and statistics (FBI UCR) prove that blacks do not require an &#8216;issue&rsquo; to engage in violence.  Their predisposition for it must be in their DNA.  How else can it be explained?  </p>

			<p>Publicity hound that he is(and as surely he would want everybody to know), the home address of Alfred(&#8220;De Revrun&#8221;)Sharpton is:   680 Madison Avenue; New York, NY 10021.</p>

			<p>Since whites still make up the majority of the electorate, Obama has to &#8220;grandstand&#8221; in front of them, so do all the other candidates. It&rsquo;s required public behavior to get elected in democratic politics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it tells the voter nothing about the candidate beyond the candidate&rsquo;s functional ability to mouth words he and others have privately prepared.</p>

			<p>Sorry, not buying this.  There was a musical named after Obama&rsquo;s home city, which had a song called &#8220;Razzle Dazzle Em.&#8221;  I think this is all a show, because Sharpton wants Obama to win.  I guess Sharpton&rsquo;s personal calculus is that if he comes out against Obama, this will make Obama seem more &#8220;moderate&#8221; and acceptable to mainstream voters.  It also gives Obama the chance to faux triangluate away from Wright/Sharpton/Farrkhan.</p>

<p>&gt; Kevin, this only exposes the dearth of real leaders in the black community.  All they really have is Oprah and Bill Cosby, and they are principally entertainers.  But at least Mr. Cosby has the guts to criticize his own people.</p>

<p>Wrong.  Al Sharpton is just a jealous vindictive simple man who wants to see Obma crash and burn.  He resents him because he is better looking, better spoken, taller, and much more well liked by whites.  He would stick a knife in Obama in a second if he could.</p>

			<p>Of course Obama is grandstanding in front of white people. Non-blacks are 88% of the US, and we whites are still most of those, percentages varying, depending on whom one calls &#8220;white.&#8221;  He has to act appealing, even if it IS merely a show.  Does anyone imagine that a fellow who would listen to Reverend Wright&rsquo;s Sunday tirades and who thinks white Americans like religion and firearms &#8220;out of bitterness&#8221; would be remotely electable if he was not also a good actor?</p>
<p>Obama missed his true calling; he would have made a fortune in Hollywood.  We would have seen a movie about the Wright brothers being stumped, and Leroy Jackson would have helped them out.  We&rsquo;d have seen another movie about how Winston Churchill was too drunk to participate in the cavalry charge at Omdurmun in 1898, and had to be helped onto his horse by Mustafa abd-al-Jihad, and decades later, when Churchill saved Western Civilization from what Hitler himself was calling a &#8220;Counter-Enlightenment&#8221;, Mustafa would have been writing his speeches.  After that, we&rsquo;d have a movie about the Apollo project being dead in the water until Darnell Washington invented the slide rule and rescued whitey once again.</p>
<p>As a mere politician, The Obaminable Showman made a terrible career mistake.</p>

			<p>Publicity hound that he is(and as surely he would want everybody to know), the home address of Alfred(&ldquo;De Revrun&rdquo;)Sharpton is: 680 Madison Avenue; New York, NY 10021.</p>

Thanks for the info, we should all write him a little note or three. But don&rsquo;t use too many big words, it&rsquo;ll only confuse him. I plan to stick to mostly to words containing only four letters, myself.  </p>
<p>And for those unfamiliar with NYC, let me point out that 680 Mad is in the East 60s, in heart of the WASPy, old-money, Upper East Side   &mdash;   and FAR FROM HARLEM or any other bajiggity neighborhood. </p>
<p>Also, the 10021 ZIP Code has the distinction of being the home of the HIGHEST PER CAPITA INCOME in all of the USA. That&rsquo;s right: higher than 90210 or anywhere else in Beverly Hills, Bel-Air, etc. </p>

<p>That Madison Avenue address is probably his business office  As I understand it, unless he&rsquo;s moved, he lives in   New Jersey.  Teaneck, I believe.<br/>
That makes him an out-of-town meddler.  An interesting observation in light of the fact that he started another riot several years back in referring to &#8220;interlopers&#8221;, whites who have businesses in Harlem.<br/>
