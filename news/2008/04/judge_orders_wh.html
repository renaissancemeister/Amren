						<p>Judge Marvin Arrington insists he&rsquo;s not a racist; despite ordering white lawyers out of his courtroom on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Fulton County Superior Court judge said he was just fed up seeing a parade of young black defendants in his courtroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came out and saw the defendants, about 99.9 percent Afro-Americans, and some point time I excused some of the lawyers, most of them white, and said to the young people in here &lsquo;What in the world are you doing with your lives,&rsquo;&#8221; he told WSB-TV Channel 2 reporter JaQuitta Williams.</p>
<p>Arrington said he thought his message might have more power if it was delivered to a blacks-only audience.</p>

					<p>This is staggering.  The judge didn&rsquo;t want to insult or embarrass the black murderers, rapists, and robbers by lecturing them in front of white attorneys.  He didn&rsquo;t want to hurt their sensitive feelings.</p>
<p>This is more black privilege in action.</p>

<p>If the Judge wants to see some white guys then he will have to leave Atlanta. </p>

<p>This article is about as real as it gets. I only hope it will be widely read, at least in the Atlanta area. It will surprise many whites, even those recovering from being mugged by blacks, to learn that it is blacks committing almost all of the urban crime.</p>
<p>Many whites still don&rsquo;t know that, since the media does everything it can to hide the evidence.</p>

					<p>No Judge you had to be honest and show some tough love right in front of these white lawyers. This playing hide and seek of black people is a big part of the problem and it perpetuates the anti-social behavior&hellip;..tell the truth because the truth will set us all free from these demons loosed upon us!</p>

					<p>So, based on race, a black judge orders 2 white lawyers <span class="caps">OUT</span> OF <span class="caps">THE COURTROOM </span>so he can talk to black defendents. Whatever happened to &#8216;come into my chambers, gentlemen. We have things to discuss.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not sure but I believe his actions are illegal and even if they aren&rsquo;t they are certainly way out of line. Dismissing key persons at a trial or hearing because of their race is shocking, not enlightened.</p>

					<p>It sounds like the majority of perps were black, but not all black (99.9%).  I wonder if he showed the same paternal concern in his speech towards any non-black defendants?</p>
<p>Not that it makes any difference anyway.  Had the reverse situation occurred, stuff would&rsquo;ve hit the fan along with the never-ending wailing about racism in the judicial system.</p>

					<p>We want blacks to condemn each other for bad behavior. Who cares about excusing whites - at least it&rsquo;s a start. A black judge had to have something going for him in the area of intelligence, organization, etc. to be on that side of the court room. Obviously, it upset him to see reality and he placed the blame where it belonged&hellip;</p>

<p><i>This article is about as real as it gets. I only hope it will be widely read, at least in the Atlanta area. It will surprise many whites, even those recovering from being mugged by blacks, to learn that it is blacks committing almost all of the urban crime.</i></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s very true - I&rsquo;d say <b>most</b> whites still don&rsquo;t know that urban crime is  overwhelmingly black.  I know I didn&rsquo;t until I started reading Amren!  It&rsquo;s always interesting looking at mugshots on individual cities&rsquo; Most Wanted lists; on the rare occasion a white is in a slot, it&rsquo;s usually for embezzlement.  I&rsquo;d love to see the racial breakdown for carjacking - if it&rsquo;s even 10 percent white, I&rsquo;ll be shocked.    </p>
<p>Most suburban crime in many cities is also black or hispanic.  DC blacks sometimes drive through Prince Georges County to get out to semi-rural Charles County Maryland to commit hold-ups.  They steal cars to drive there!  Businesses in the bad parts of DC and Maryland are often battle hardened: multiple security cameras, riot shutters, bullet-proof glass enclosures for cashiers, valuable goods locked up behind the counter, etc.  Sometimes they even have plexiglass turnstiles for passing money back and forth between the customer and the cashier (so thugs can&rsquo;t stick a gun barrel through a slot in the bullet-proof glass).  Poor Charles County businesses aren&rsquo;t prepared for urban criminals, however - they are sitting ducks.  </p>
<p>When I was 19, I used to shop at a liquor store in the ghetto (they would sell to cash-paying underage white kids with no questions asked).  The owner had a shotgun cradled in this arms in the mid-afternoon and a huge rottweiler on a leash at the back of the store.  He was always on edge looking out the door but seemed amused to see my little blond friends and me come giggling through the door.  </p>
<p>Of course was really foolish of us to go down to that neighborhood with a wad of cash, but we were all raised by liberals and thought blacks were just like working class whites with darker skin.  We&rsquo;d always been told that race was a social construct, that the &#8220;stereotype&#8221; of young black males as dangerous was &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;, and that blacks filled up the prisons because of false convictions by a &ldquo;racist&rdquo; justice system.</p>
<p>In fact, I can think of <b><span class="caps">MANY</span></b> times I placed myself in danger as a teenager because of my racial naivety.  Why didn&rsquo;t our parents tell us that blacks are 8 times more likely to commit murders than whites, or that black males rape white women by the tens of thousands every years?  Why did our teachers and friends tell us &#8220;disparate sentencing&#8221; was the reason for the black imprison rate as opposed to disparate criminality?  Did they think they were doing us a favor???  </p>

					<p>This may be against the Code of Judicial Conduct if any of the defendants were represented by counsel and his or her counsel was excluded from the courtroom.  In addition, meeting with a particular class of defendants, even in a group, while excluding others, may constitute an &#8220;appearance of impropriety,&#8221; which is not permitted by the <span class="caps">CJC.  </span><br>
In short, the judge&rsquo;s actions may be the basis for a legitimate complaint to the judicial conduct committee and/or the state bar association.</p>

					<p>Had white society been kinder and more understanding to these &#8220;defendents&#8221;, then there would not have been all this crime&hellip;..remember that bit of &#8220;African&#8221; logic from a previous post?</p>
<p>Blacks and Whites <span class="caps">THINK </span>different, as do all different breeds within the same species. Horse, dogs, and cat breeds all have different temperments and behaviours. Just like us humans. Duh.</p>
<p>We need to have a white court system for rational law, and an African court systme for &#8220;tribal&#8221; law&hellip;or what ever what they do is called.</p>

					<p>I agree that Judge Arrington is not a racist. In fact, his enlightened views should be welcomed by all. His realization of the truth is laudable and his sincerity is commendable. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, far more substantial and concentrated efforts to resolve the social problems associated with the presence of Blacks have been made for well over 40 years. The results are invariably the same and universally predictable. </p>
<p>A &#8220;stern message&#8221; to Black criminals by Judge Arrington is not the solution. For starters, more criminal justice funding would be a step closer to the best solution.<br>

I don&rsquo;t condone what he did. I would support him if it was acceptable for white judges do to the same. Since it&rsquo;s not (because we&rsquo;re all supposed to be treated equally) then he should have to abide by the rules and not segregate. This is more in the line of blacks wanting things for themselves that they deny to whites. If I&rsquo;m not free to segregate by race, then this judge has no right either. That&rsquo;s what blacks demanded and it&rsquo;s what they got. They need to learn to live with the rules they impose on us.</p>

					<p>I don&rsquo;t think the judge is fundamentally much different than the defendants.  Affirmative action is a way to pay Blacks to behave themselves.  I imagine if you gave all the defendants an affirmative-action judgeship, then they would sort of behave themselves, too.</p>

					<p>If white people aren&rsquo;t aware of the preponderance of black crime then what causes white flight?</p>
<p>Like so many things on this site, the reality is far more mundane.  Take murder for instance - you&rsquo;re nearly twice as likely to commit suicide than to be murdered.</p>
<p>Yes blacks have much higher rates of criminal behavior than whites.  The difference is real even if slightly exacerbated by demographics (e.g., greater % of blacks are 18-25).  Despite this we&rsquo;re still talking about rare events.  Most Americans will go through their entire life without ever being mugged, raped or killed!</p>
<p>Having to deal with a segment of the population that has much higher rates of criminality is annoying but is not exclusive to race.  Men commit crime more often than women.  Young men commit more crime than older men.  Single men commit crime more often than married men.</p>
<p>Calm down people!<br>

					<p>Saying that black on white rape is about race completely misses the point.  Black men rape white women at higher rates than other women for the same reason that men, in general, rape younger women at higher rates than older women.  For the same reason that men rob banks - because that&rsquo;s where the money is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not racial, it&rsquo;s plain and simple lust.  White women are, on average, more attractive than other women.  The preference for white women is found pretty much everywhere they&rsquo;re available; for example, japanese men prefer white escorts.  </p>
<p>In nearly all cultures there is the concept of beauty being a &#8220;blessing and a curse&#8221;.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Why is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Simple. Brainwashing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Political Correctness&#8221; is a closed-loop system.  Your friends, coworkers, even family members are part of that loop.</p>
<p>But what is the input into that loop? It&rsquo;s the ostensibly voluntary &#8220;opinion&#8221; and &#8220;commentary&#8221; that you encounter in your daily activities. That is, when the news media seeks out a gun controller to coment on the latest gun law, when you hear on <span class="caps">CSI </span>or Law &amp; Order that the only legitimate &#8220;civilian&#8221; owned gun is a registered gun or one where the police issued you a permit or read in New Scientist magazine how &#8220;gun control&#8221; could have prevented the Virgina tech shootings.</p>
<p>When you stop this input into the system, then, you have stopped your brainwashing.</p>

					<p>Arrington was the Atlanta city council president. During that time, a  co-worker of mine (white female) said he was a fool. His recent actions may have been foolish from the standpoint of legality or propriety, but at least he recognizes the situation and addressed it. </p>
<p>H. Dumpty, the media indeed play down race when blacks victimize whites and maybe when they do their own or Hispanics, but even the crybaby liberals can&rsquo;t hide the obvious truth.</p>
