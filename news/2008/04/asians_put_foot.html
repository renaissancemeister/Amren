						<p>Asians &mdash; those smart,  hard-working people you&rsquo;ve always been told believe in merit and would never act like the NAACP or La Raza &mdash; have joined the racial spoils system. They have gotten in right at the top, and they are playing dirty. They have extracted pandering promises from all the Democratic candidates for president &mdash; promises Al Sharpton would be proud to get for blacks &mdash; and have treated the candidates like fools for good measure. Barack Obama is the only Democrat to come out of this with at least a shred of self-respect.</p>
<p>The group behind this is one you never heard of: the so-called <a href="https://www.80-20initiative.net/">80-20 Initiative</a>. Founded in 1997 by Dr. S. B. Woo, an immigrant from China and former lieutenant governor of Delaware, it gets its name from its proclaimed goal, which is to deliver 80 percent of the Asian vote to candidates it supports, especially in close races where an Asian bloc vote could swing the election.</p>
<p>It is an almost entirely web-based political pressure group, which claims to have an e-mail list of 750,000 Asians it can activate at the touch of a <b>&#8220;send&#8221;</b> button. In an interview on CNN, Dr. Woo <a href="https://www.80-20initiative.net/success/media_mainstream_080215cnn.asp">claimed</a> 80-20 can reach 55 percent of the <b>&#8220;Asian-American community&#8221;</b> within eight hours.</p>
<p>80-20 claims that Asians may be the worst victims of  racial discrimination in America. As board member Frank Lee put it in a <a href="https://www.80-20initiative.net/news/press080118.asp">statement</a> in January: <b>&#8220;We are truly fighting for .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rights already enjoyed by all Americans except for Asian Americans.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>The solution? Quotas &mdash; but not quotas for jobs like bricklayer or policeman. 80-20 wants quotas for <a href="https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1994/vp941013/10130480.htm">federal judges</a> and top management in government and <a href="https://olimu.com/webjournalism/Texts/Commentary/RaceOnWallSt.htm">private industry</a>. And it is playing hardball to get them.</p>
<p>80-20 started extracting promises from presidential candidates in the 2004 election. To back up its demands, the group has put together charts and graphs, claiming that Asians are only half as likely as non-Asians to be promoted to top management in industry, and only one-third as likely to get high-level jobs in government. They <a href="/action/equalopp_washingtonpost_wpad.jpg">claim</a> women, blacks, and Hispanics all do better than Asians.</p>
<p>Based on these claims, 80-20 sent letters to all the 2004 candidates, offering its endorsement if they promised to do three things if elected:</p>
<blockquote>1.&nbsp;Order the Secretary of Labor (who at the moment is Elaine Chao) to hold public hearings on discrimination against Asians,
<p>2.&nbsp;Order the labor department&rsquo;s Office of Federal Contract Compliance to crack down if the statistics suggest <a href="/ar/1997/07/index.html#cover">discrimination</a>, and</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Meet with Asian-American leaders two years later to report on progress in the fight against anti-Asian discrimination.</blockquote></p>
<p>How do you fight the kind of <b>&#8220;discrimination&#8221;</b> that you <b>&#8220;prove with statistics?&#8221;</b> If blacks are 13 percent of the population but only 4 percent of the postmen, you torment the Postal Service until 13 percent of the <a href="https://www.reason.com/news/show/29527.html">postmen</a> are black. In other words, quotas. That was what 80-20 wanted for the top jobs in the country.</p>
<p>80-20 did <a href="https://www.80-20initiative.net/news/preselect2004.asp">pretty well</a> with the candidates. John Edwards, John Kerry, Howard Dean, Joe Lieberman, Dennis Kucinich, and Ralph Nader all took the pledge. Al Sharpton was running, but didn&rsquo;t sign; he must not have liked the idea of Asians horning in on his territory. George W. Bush didn&rsquo;t sign either.</p>
<p>This year, 80-20 wants more. In the <b>&#8220;<a href="https://www.80-20initiative.net/news/preselect2008_questionnaire.asp">Presidential Candidate Questionnaire</a>&#8221;</b> it sent out on June 1, 2007, it kept the first three promises about stamping out <b>&#8220;discrimination,&#8221;</b> and added three more. To get an endorsement, candidates now had to promise to appoint at least two Asians as appeals court judges &mdash; none is Asian now &mdash; and <b>&#8220;consider&#8221;</b> filling a Supreme Court vacancy with an Asian.</p>
<p>At the district court level, 80-20 wanted an outright quota. Candidates had to promise that during their first term they would appoint enough Asians to boost their numbers to half their percentage of the population. That would be an increase from the present 6 to 21 judges &mdash; a three-fold increase &mdash; and would mean the president would have to send up a parade of Asian nominations.</p>
<p>Candidates also had to promise to meet with Asian-American leaders to <b>&#8220;review the progress in adding AsAm</b> [Asian-American] <b>Federal judges,&#8221;</b> that is to say, be browbeaten.</p>
<p>Chris Dodd, Joe Biden, and Mike Gravel all took the 80-20 pledge in June 2007, just days after they got the questionnaire, and shamelessly <a href="https://www.80-20initiative.net/news/preselect2008.asp">bound themselves to a quota for Asian judges.</a> 80-20 <a href="https://www.80-20initiative.net/about/importance_political_power.asp">crowed</a> that candidates had <b>&#8220;replied with the <i>iron-clad promise</i> of 6 yeses!&#8221;</b> [Emphasis in the original, by the way]</p>
<p>For six months after that, though, 80-20 got no bites. So it decided to lower its sights.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s people negotiated less binding terms. On December 10, she signed what 80-20 calls a <b>&#8220;revised&#8221;</b> version of the questionnaire. The promises to end <b>&#8220;discrimination&#8221;</b> against Asians were unchanged, but instead of an outright quota on judicial appointments, Mrs. Clinton promised to <b>&#8220;seek to increase&#8221;</b> Asian nominations <b>&#8220;until the current dismal situation is significantly remedied.&#8221;</b> The language of the promise <a href="https://www.80-20initiative.net/news/preselect2008_clinton.asp">goes on to explain</a>: <b>&#8220;To put things in perspective, not meaning to imply quotas, presently there are 0.6% Asian Am. Federal judges, while the Asian Am. population is 4.5%.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</b></p>
<p><b><i>&#8220;Not meaning to imply quotas?&#8221;</i></b> A quota is <i>exactly</i> what 80-20 wanted, but couldn&rsquo;t get from Mrs. Clinton. Instead, they got a quota in everything but name. She agreed that both at the district and appeals court levels the current situation is <b> &#8220;dismal,&#8221;</b> and she promised to improve things <b>&#8220;significantly&#8221;</b> during her first term. She thus committed herself to openly race-based judicial appointments, and, like the others, agreed to a browbeating session two years into her term.</p>
<p>John Edwards and Bill Richardson later signed the same <b>&#8220;revised&#8221;</b> version.</p>
<p>What did Mrs. Clinton get in return? Just before the crucial California primary, 80-20 endorsed her. <b>&#8220;Sen. Obama willfully refused</b> [to sign]<b>,&#8221;</b> 80-20 <a href="https://www.80-20initiative.net/news/press080118.asp">huffed</a>. <b>&#8220;That is why we endorse Sen. Clinton.&#8221;</b> The group also promised to spend $30,000 on political ads for Mrs. Clinton in the Asian ethnic media, including <a href="https://www.80-20initiative.net/news/preselect2008_caprim_ad.asp">radio ads in Cantonese, Mandarin, and Korean.</a> Mrs. Clinton did win the Asian vote three-to-one over Mr. Obama. And, of course, 80-20 claimed credit.</p>
<p>After losing the California primary Barack Obama got religion and decided to take the pledge, too. But he has been the cagiest player of all. He swallowed the demands to correct <b>&#8220;discrimination&#8221;</b> against Asians without a gurgle, but his people rewrote the questions about judicial appointments. He <a href="https://www.80-20initiative.net/news/preselect2008_obama.asp">promised only</a> that he will make it a <b>&#8220;top priority&#8221;</b> to appoint <a href="/uploads/napaba/Seeking_20APA_20Judges_20Article.pdf">Asian-Americans</a> as district and appeals court judges.</p>
<p>Presidents are, of course, busy people with lots of <b>&#8220;top priorities,&#8221;</b> so Mr. Obama got away with promising the least. No doubt he will have an even higher <b>&#8220;top priority&#8221;</b> making <a href="https://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877263,00.html?promoid=googlep">judicial appointments</a> for a certain other racial pressure group.</p>
<p>80-20 has duly endorsed every candidate that took the pledge, so it is now officially neutral in the Democratic race. Not one Republican candidate bothered to return the questionnaire, and  John McCain shows no sign of doing so.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s take a look at the sleazy way 80-20 doled out its endorsements. It started by saying it would back only those candidates who made certain promises. Why, then, did it let Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama successively water down the promises others had already made? It brazenly cheated Senators Dodd, Biden, and Gravel when it let Mrs. Clinton make weaker promises and then gave her the same endorsement it had given them &mdash; they were still in the race. It then cheated Mrs. Clinton when it let Mr. Obama sign an even weaker pledge to get the same endorsement.</p>
<p>80-20 is playing the candidates for the fools they are. Needless to say, the candidates have all been very quiet about how they were tricked, and about the race-based judicial appointments they have promised to make.</p>
<p>In the larger sense, however, what does 80-20 tell us about the kind of Americans Asians want to be? Traditionally, they have been the one minority that has not played the victim. It&rsquo;s not a convincing role for the racial group with the highest incomes, the highest life expectancy, the lowest crime and poverty rates, and a <a href="https://www.goldsea.com/Profiles/100/100.html">prominent record of success</a> in companies like <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2004/03/12/2003102170">Yahoo</a> and <a href="https://www.crn.com/networking/187202382">Linksys</a>.</p>
<p>Asians could have chosen to emphasize their common interests with whites &mdash; eliminating <b>&#8220;affirmative action,&#8221;</b> promoting tough sentences for criminals, keeping out illegal Mexicans &mdash; rather than join the chorus about discrimination. Asians can make it on merit and do just fine in <a href="https://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/color_of_meritocracy.htm"> race-blind competition.</a></p>
<p>But if Asians insist on quotas for judges and <a href="https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1130&amp;context=key_workplace">CEOs</a>, they shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to find the tables turned elsewhere. They will pay &mdash; along with whites &mdash; if blacks and Hispanics get serious about quotas in engineering and medicine. Likewise, in a world of quotas, they would see their admissions to the Ivy League cut by two-thirds.</p>
<p>So why is the one group that consistently out-performs whites claiming to be oppressed?</p>
<p><i>Because they can get away with it.</i> They have found an area in which Asians probably are underrepresented, and are shouting <b>&#8220;discrimination&#8221;</b> because they know practically no one &mdash; certainly no presidential candidate &mdash; is going to make the obvious argument: If underrepresentation is all it takes to prove discrimination, then most of the time America discriminates <i>in favor</i> of Asians.</p>
<p>In the end, it looks as though the advantages blacks and Hispanics have gained from racial activism, bloc-voting, and an aggressive victim mentality are simply too attractive even for Asians to forgo. As the United States continues to lose racial and cultural coherence, Asians appear to be deciding they have nothing to gain by staying out of explicitly racial politics in their current implicit alliance with whites.</p>
<p>And why should Asians line up with a white majority that does not defend its own interests? What was once supposedly the <b>&#8220;model minority&#8221;</b> is obviously concluding that, in the age of <b>&#8220;diversity&#8221;,</b> power comes from racial solidarity.</p>
<p>When will whites get the message?<br>

			<p>  I&rsquo;ve got an even better suggestion, why not stop ALL asian immigration into this country. We must, in order to survive as a white population, reverse the 1965 civil rights act. We must stop all immigration from all countries except european countries. If we lack the fortitude to stand up for our own, then we can kiss our white race goodbye in the U.S.</p>

			<p>As another poster on this board aptly stated, Only White people are Americans; all others are residents and guests. I am not at all surprised by this article and await the day when our residents and guests get the message that we&rsquo;re through with them and that they have long overstayed their &#8220;welcome&#8221; (ha).</p>

			<p>I was very disappointed about what Jared wrote. It comes across something like this&#8221;Gee, if Asians would just be good conservatives Asians and White Americans could be friends and form a political alliance&#8221;.</p>
<p>No mention of the mention of the fact that LEGAL Asian immigrants have been straling jobs from White American men since the early 1970&rsquo;s. My late father, along with thousands of other White American Men who served in WW11 and Korean war were thrown out of work and replaced by Legal Asian immigrants in the early and mid 1970&rsquo;s. The job theft is occurring on a greater scale these days.</p>
<p>No mention by Jared of the fact that Asians have colonized and taken over towns in Californa and NJ. From what I am told, the same thing is happening on LI</p>
<p>Post-1965 Asians in America could never be natural allies of White Americans within the borders of America. Any self-respecting White Nationalist would be appalled at the fact that a large part of South Plainfield has been colonized by LEGAL immigrant hindus and sihks. Drive through South Plainfield. It now belongs to India.</p>
<p>On a more fundamental level,young Native Born White males are competing with young Asian males for the scarce resouces-becomming scarcer with each passing year- of America. No self-respecting White Nationalist should tolerate this state of affairs. </p>
<p>Post-1965 Asians can never be our allies. I also don&rsquo;t believe that Asians-Japanese,Chinese and Indians are smarter than Europeans-IQ scores notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Either you beleive Native Born White Americans should be a racial minority or you don&rsquo;t. If you do beleive that Native Born White Americans should remain a racial minority then all non-white immigration should be shut down to 0. This includes Asian LEGAL immigration. No compromise with the enemy. Do not concede an inch to them.</p>
<p>Asians in America were a big problem for White Americans before the 80-20 political movement. <br>

			<p>Every race plays the racial spoils game. Ostensibly taking from whites, the only group who can&rsquo;t fight back, while ignoring any advantages over whites they enjoy, and even pressing their advantage. Celebrating it.</p>
<p>When the US breaks up into white/black zones, or even into white/hispanic/black regions, we&rsquo;ll see just how much all the other groups - middle east, Indian, Asian, Amerindian, jewish&hellip; we&rsquo;ll see Exactly how much these other groups value their rainbow coalition for real. To their misfortune they may find out whites have a long memory. Gather around the rainbow flag while ye may.  </p>

			<p>Good thing Asians have the lowest vote turnout.  So this group will not be influential, and Asians as a whole don&rsquo;t feel the need for any ballot box racial advocacy.  </p>

			<p>This presupposes that &#8220;Asians&#8221; are a monolithic block and don&rsquo;t hate one another the way Croatians and Serbs or&hellip; Chinese and Japanese do, or better yet, Viets and Hmong.</p>
<p>Many Asians *do* choose to emphasize their common interests with whites, a few liberal nitwits aside.  They&rsquo;re voting with their genese when 1/3 of the women and 1/6 of the men marry whites.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor has merely encountered an Asian version of the ADL; that&rsquo;s all.  There are Marxist race-hucksters among every ethnic group.</p>

			<p>Asians are a latecomer to the game. Seeing just how effective victimhood can be in America, it was just too tempting to resit no longer. But it&rsquo;s not that the majority of Asians have a collective will or victimhood consciousness.</p>
<p>There was bound to be a few business people, because that&rsquo;s what they are, who got the idea of going into the public funding sector where they control the flow of and dip into vast sums of money. It&rsquo;s never about true fairness as it is about using supposed group victimhood as a vehicle for advancing one&rsquo;s personal interest and having an easy way out. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even about racial solidarity as most people believe. Group interest only exists when the individual benefits. Proepects for personal gain is being exploited by these business people.</p>

			<p>This article, and the article in this months AR magazine (by Duncan Hengest on Hawaii), are clear indications of a change of tone (or &#8220;clarification&#8221; of tone, as it may be) toward Asians.  I hope that the phenomenon describes in this article is not representative of the attitude of most Asians in the U.S. I think we should give Asians, as a group, the benefit of the doubt until it becomes clear that rank and file Asians are behind these new quotas.  Cold and analytical as Mr. Taylor usually is, I detect a sense of anger and betrayal in this article - understandably so.  Quotas are evil - but what will happen when whites become a minority in the U.S. and it becomes acceptable for whites to identify as a group?  Whites will obviously be subject to even more discrimination than today and many whites will then demand quotas as well.  This diversity business sure is complicated, isn&rsquo;t it?  It&rsquo;s like IRS tax paperwork and just about as useful.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like to congratulate AMREN for finally doing a story that strips the facade off America&rsquo;s so-called &#8220;model minority&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m sure this story will have all the trolls and race mixers out in full force on here talking about how they&rsquo;re our natural allies.  I was listening to some story today about some Chinese student in Knoxville who leaked sensitive military secrets to the motherland.  This sort of thing seems to be a common occurrence anymore in the government.  Oh well, diversity is strength.  All these ethnic groups, blacks, mestizos and orientals are circling like buzzards waiting for a wounded White America to finally fall and die so they can feed on the carcass.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some food for thought.  In the spring of 2002, a three-day conference was held-no press allowed-in Leesburg VA.  It was a joint meeting of the black, hispanic and asian caucuses of the House of Representatives.  No Whites allowed.  </p>

			<p>It remains to be seen if Asians can come together.  Asian nations have never showed solidarity between nations each other in East Asia.  So forming a block here will be an uphill battle.  I would rename the group 50-50.  In other words, if the 80-20 group panders to Asian solidarity they may end up with a 50-50 tie.  So 50-50 is a better name for the group.  The only thing that will unite Asians is the same thing that will unite whites or unite blacks - ethnic hatred or racism directed against them.</p>

			<p> &ldquo;What was once supposedly the &lsquo;model minority&rsquo; is obviously concluding that, in the age of &lsquo;diversity,&rsquo; power comes from racial solidarity.</p>
<p>When will whites get the message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An interesting question Mr. Taylor!</p>
<p>But a more pressing one is this, if Asians are not going to be a model minority, if they are going to act as brazenly idiotic as all the rest, then why they shouldn&rsquo;t they be treated with the same contempt by whites, as blacks and Hispanics should have been treated for the last two decades at least? To me it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they excel academically or do well economically, if they engage in seeking their fantasized &ldquo;due,&rdquo; at the majority&rsquo;s expense, then they are nothing more than a parasitical racial enemy in my book.</p>
<p>Often much praise is heaped upon Asians on this website, that while somewhat deserving in their own countries, is wholly undeserved in this one. There is a simple reason for this, despite all of their admirable characteristics, they remain alien invaders who are not white. This current &ldquo;radicalizing&rdquo; of them into a yellow peril pressure group, only accentuates this; there have been other recent examples too, such as when the Asian &ldquo;journalist&rdquo; associations sought to suppress the Korean &ldquo;American&rdquo; murderer&rsquo;s ethnicity in the Virginia Tech atrocity. </p>
<p>And here I am restricting my comments to East Asians only.</p>
<p>As for such lesser varieties as: Hmong, East Indians, Pakistanis, and Cambodians, I will simply note that my views are even more strident. </p>
<p>Enough said!</p>

			<p>Those of us who pay attention understand that &#8220;minority&#8221; victim status in Western society is entirely at the expense of White Americans.  Victim status for these so called minority groups is endorsed by our banking and corporate &#8220;elite&#8221; and as a result our bought and paid for politicians. They want globalization and victim status and all the associated programs at the expense of the taxpayer is one of a number of tools being used. Immigration of &#8220;victims&#8221; into Western Society both legal and illegal is another. That is why nothing is ever done about illegal immigration.  Victim status is not designed to EVER go away, it is ETERNAL. Victim status is also designed to become more discriminatory over time and more and more detrimental to the well being of those descended from ethnic European stock in Western Society.  </p>

			<p>Whites will have to be backed into a corner to fully wake up. When the economy takes a complete dive and they see all non-whites getting better treatment from Uncle Sam, that should help. The non-whites already do get better treatment but whites refuse to see it or they&rsquo;ve been intimidated out of stating the obvious. There&rsquo;s also little doubt that the powers that coach the blacks and hispanics in the racial spoils system, guide them in fighting whites, teaching them whites are responsible for their ills are also the people behind the scenes doing this with Asians. </p>

			<p>Affirmative action is a curse.   It sends a message that incumbents can only get the post through legal shenanigans as is being proven in South Africa where whites have been, and still are, leaving the country in droves as they are ignored for jobs that must be given to black people, regardless of skills and experince.   Essential services are collapsing everywhere and one such service is electrical power generation where funds earmarked by the previous government for the long term planning of new generating stations have, in a true Marxist manner, been spent on un-needed weapons for a defence force that has been AA-ed and is reported in the SA Press to be decimated by soldiers who are riddled with AIDS and hepatitis, and so on.  They are even having to recall sacked whites to keep essentials going - in the Defence Force?</p>
<p>Recently, due to the regular power cuts now, 260 million litres (nearly 70-million US gallons) of raw human sewage was spilt into the sea near Durban.  Durban is like Coney Island, or Venice Beach, famous for its swimming beaches and a major port and holiday city.  No electricity means no pumps, etc. to process sewage. Inland rivers and dams are now unsafe to swim in as well as being dodgy to use boats in as recreation.</p>
<p>The next looming catastrophe is food shortages as whites are kicked off their very productive farms for blacks to move in as in Zimabawe.  Already production is a lot less on such farms that have been treated so, and yet, sub-Saharan Africa could feed itself aas it did in the days of Rhodesia.</p>

			<p>Meh, they are just watching out for their own interest. We should have aligned more with asians as soon as we realized that they are law abiding and smart rather than pandering to blacks and hispanics. </p>
<p>The asians have figured out that the whites are just knuckling down to blacks and hispanic pressure and have no backbone. The asians want to get their people into some government job before it is all blacks and hispanics who will try to jealously keep out asians and whites. They have decided that we whites have no real direction anymore and are ripe for the picking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll actually be rather pleasant to have majority asian american bureaucrats rather than blacks or hispanics. Dealing with government offices, airports, and other big government departments now is brutal because they are so dumb and slow!! I almost have a heart attack when I have to deal with their asinine reasoning and indifference to providing any type of service.</p>

<p>Yes Brian it is.  I remember the University of Michigan affirmative action case.  That was my wakeup. I had very little interest in politics before that and always at least morally supported the Democratic party.  This all changed very quickly. In remember reading about among other things the &#8220;Green Brief&#8221;. </p>
<p>By far the most persuasive brief in the University of Michigan preference cases is the so-called &#8220;green brief&#8221; or &#8220;generals&rsquo; amicus brief.&#8221; </p>
<p>A constellation of military figures have signed onto a brief in support of the University of Michigan&rsquo;s preferential admissions program  &mdash;  including such admired figures as retired generals Norman Schwartzkopf, Hugh Shelton, and Anthony Zinni. </p>
<p>The &ldquo;generals&rsquo; brief&rdquo; argued that an integrated officer corps was necessary for national security and such integration is achieved through the use of affirmative action.</p>
<p>WOW! Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous that made so little logical sense?  It certainly got me to thinking and asking myself why do these &#8220;patriotic&#8221; retired generals want to defend affirmative action. It sort of got me thinking about the Supreme Court as well and what sort of interests they really represent. I will footnote in future posts.<br>

			<p>I am glad that the article in the most recent issue of AR examines Asian racial prejudice toward Whites.  Too many people on this site have a positive attitude toward Asians as they are more intelligent than Blacks or Hispanics (but not as intelligent as ourselves, despite having a slightly higher IQ) and are much less crime prone.  Asians are still racial and cultural aliens and aiding in the displacement of White America.</p>

			<p>  East Asians are generally good quality immigrants for most Western countries. They are generally hard-working and law-abiding. However, once a critical population mass is reached, ethnic politics begin in earnest. In today&rsquo;s sick liberal atmosphere, every minority group wants to claim victim&rsquo;s status and demand special rights and privileges. This can only lead to continued ethnic conflict and strife. I say we need to be limited and selective in our immigration.</p>

<p>Are you kidding me? They exhibit the frugality, the family loyalty, the academic excellence that WE would do very well to emulate! That a very small minority of them engages in strong-arm democratic tactics that others have engaged in should not cause you to commit another humorous logical falacy and lump them all together. <br>
 <br>
&#8220;They are nothing more than a parasitical racial enemy in my book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your book must be very small indeed, John, and very badly written. What you call parasitical depends upon one&rsquo;s point of view. The &#8220;parasite&#8221; does not see it that way. Whites did not see it that way when they were in other people&rsquo;s countries, doing what Asians are doing here. The more benighted natives of those countries probably did. </p>
<p>No, what Asians are doing is expanding their power. This, as Nietzsche pointed out, is the drive of all healthy beings. And don&rsquo;t jump at the name, Nietzsche  &mdash;  he was a very gentle man who hated and opposed the idea of &#8220;social Darwinism&#8221;, whereby the &#8220;strong&#8221; trample the &#8220;weak&#8221; underfoot, by military force or unethical power plays. What he meant by the &#8220;will to power&#8221; was more like the power to &#8220;become what you are.&#8221;    </p>
<p>It must be pointed out that most Asians are playing by the American playbook, by our rules, becoming what they are in a country where they are allowed to do so. That a few of them act like &#8220;civil rights leaders&#8221; is to be expected, and not condoned. </p>
<p>I do not call it &#8220;parasitical.&#8221; Rather, I admire it, while at the same time I lament the Wimpiness of the Whites, their abandoning of excellence, morality and family ties, and I appreciate our country even more.   </p>
<p>How would you prevent the Asians, legally, in our free country? </p>

<p>Notice, educators and the media accredit these groups, instead of persecuting them. It&rsquo;s all in the stated name of anti-discrimination efforts. The irony is that the resulting anti-white propaganda is nearly indistinguishable from anti-jewish propaganda that took place in German during the holocaust. Of course when it&rsquo;s repeated by the left - when it&rsquo;s pointed out all the individual ways in which all problems in history and in the present are caused by one particular group, it&rsquo;s considered enlightenment. And any protestations against it: hate.</p>

The medical techniques and technology we Whites gave the rest of the world more than paid for any supposed exploitation.</p>
<p>People want, PREFER to be surrounded by their own kind. So why shouldn&rsquo;t we Whites DEMAND a White America. Let the third-worlders stay in their own lands. Leave us alone. We pay for what we buy from them; that should be sufficient.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve actually read, that among Asians born in the USA, Asian men were more likely to marry white than Asian women. Including, imported, Asian wives into the picture might produce such a figure. Of course I&rsquo;ve read much published regional studies (ones that looked only at California, for example, and not at the whole nation) that also showed such figures.<br>

			<p>Lets not be naive; we all knew something like this would happen eventually. Any healthy race will inevitably start working toward their own advancement, and for Asians to not do that would indicate something was seriously wrong. I think it&rsquo;s shameful that an orginization would resort to such manipulative tactics, but I console myself with the fact that Asians as a whole don&rsquo;t have much solidarity. The East Asians look down on the Southeast Asians, the Koreans look down on the Chinese, and the Japanese look down on everyone else.</p>

			<p>This is just one more piece of damning evidence that multiculturalism is slowly leading us to break up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way a fractious society can continue to endure with so many contentious elements, showing loyalty only to their race and their home countries and regarding this country as nothing more than a place to make money and try to gain power and dominance for their respective groups.</p>
<p>In addition to that, we&rsquo;re becoming seriously overpopulated.  The news just these last couple of weeks reported several countries in the world where food riots are occurring due in part to the increase in corn production, designated for the ethanol market.  Though we haven&rsquo;t witnessed such an extreme here&hellip;YET&hellip;food prices are increasing at many times the present rate of inflation, and there have been many subdued reports of a permanent reduction in our underground water tables, with a corresponding reduction in crops relying on adequate irrigation or rainfall.  Still the multicults beat the drums for more inundation by third world hordes. </p>
<p>Because these dangers aren&rsquo;t emphasized, we&rsquo;re going to wake up one morning and find that serious food shortages are occurring here, and it will appear to most that the situation evolved overnight while they were sleeping.</p>
<p>There is just no will on the part of anybody, but those here and a few groups like Amren, CofCC, a few anti-immigrant groups, Pat Buchanan and Lou Dobbs, to sound the alarm.  Consequently, the multicults seem to be riding high atop a stagecoach, looking down on all of us below with bits in our mouths being pushed onward and guided by these self-appointed elitists.  </p>

			<p>Hello, John.</p>
<p>I think you are still engaging in the logical fallacy of &#8220;hasty generalization.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few Asians engage in strong-arm tactics, so they are all labeled as parasites?</p>
<p>I know this begs the question, At what point do we draw a conclusion about the race, as a whole? With Blacks, since so many of the men are in jail, and so many of the girls have illegitimate babies, we can, I think, be justified in drawing a conclusion (I am still open to the fact that some Blacks are fine people, though.)</p>
<p>I think it is different with Asians.</p>
<p>My son naturally has gravitated to them, even before I found out about my DNA. The Asians at his school are the brightest, the most creative, the most moral. The Blacks at his school are par for the course for Blacks, sadly, with a few glorious exceptions.</p>
<p>I think you are also hastily generalizing about &hellip; me.  I said in a former post, that the hippies were right about the Viet Nam war, that we should never have been there. I think they were correct. I don&rsquo;t know to this day what we were doing there. I don&rsquo;t care if other nations have democracy, if it costs American lives. Even if I did, I do not think that we can make them have it. It is not worth one American life! </p>
<p>I have already established contacts in Mexico and Australia. My son (and daughters) will go there if we invade Iran AND establish a draft, as might have to be done.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t think I am a &#8220;conservative.&#8221; Conservatives are bound by the &#8220;authority of the ordinary.&#8221; For example, those execrable lyrics by the meddling New England Transcendentalist Julia Ward Howe:</p>
<p>                &#8220;In the beauty of the lillies (?)<br>
                 Christ was born across the sea&#8221;</p>
<p>and then the abomination:</p>
<p>                &#8220;As He died to make men holy,<br>
                 Let us die to make men free&#8221; </p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh, a conservative, actually praised this abomination on his radio show the other day. I say, Let people die to make their own selves free. It is not worth one American life, nor is it our duty or obligation. (Did Julia Ward Howe know war first hand? No, she did not! What she meant was, &#8220;Let you and your kids (not me or my kids) die to make men free.&#8221;   </p>
<p>Back to the hippies: This does not mean that I support the hippies in their use of drugs, their free love, their carelessness about money, etc. Absolutely not.  And this characterization is a necessary generalization  &mdash;  I am careful not to put all hippies in the same boat. The thread of March 28 was shut down before I could reply to you so I am glad you brought up the subject on this post. (The Byrds and the Doors, hippies all, sure did make some good music, though! And the back-to-earth Mother Earth News types may yet prove to have been right about the correct life-style, after all!)</p>
<p>You have a lively and interesting style of writing, John, whoever you are (I have noticed some style-changes in the writing of the PM&rsquo;s, leading me to believe that perhaps there is more than one of you.) You are one of the few on here who can actually make me laugh. And you have paid me the courtesy of seriously considering my writings.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that 80/20 exaggerates its numbers, but they apparently have enough followers to persuade the Democrats to bend to their will.  And I don&rsquo;t doubt that Hilary has her own operators to verify whether or not the threats of 80/20 can be backed with votes.  Given the threats to our race today, I don&rsquo;t think we owe 80/20 or any other anti-White organization an inch of slack.</p>

			<p>Better nip this in the bud while their numbers are low, or we will be paying for it even more. Of course you won&rsquo;t hear about it through the MSM, but asians are extremely nationalistic and racist. I have lived and worked around many asians, and they are arguably even more racist than any other minorities I have met. Further, those from China (where of course the largest population occurs) were indoctrinated growing up under a Communist/Socialist education system which taught them extreme nationalism. Their favorite song is the Chinese version of &#8220;The Internationale&#8221; (the Communist anthem)- which of course they pretend the Chinese invented. They believe China has done every accomplishment under the sun. One actually asked me once what accomplisment white people ever made. I guess they must teach them that Industialization, the Scientific Method, Modern Medicine, etc. were all invented by Chinese!</p>
<p>The asians I know overwhelmingly support Asia and asians, show preferential hire of their own, preferentially purchase Chinese goods. Even when I pointed out goods that were of poorer quality, it didn&rsquo;t matter- they still did it to support China. They have large email groups where they encourage each other to sway votes, etc. Of course, you are not told any of this through the common public channels; better to avoid possibly ever hurting the feelings of a minority than to prevent them from causing real harm to US citizens.<br>

			<p>It turns out the asians that Amren posters are so smitten with aren&rsquo;t above race based activism after all.  Although late comers to game pioneered by blacks, I don&rsquo;t think it will take long for them to excel (given their comparatively high intelligence) once they have sufficient numbers.  I predict the first order of action will be to clamor for millions more of their kinsmen from China, Japan and other Asian nations. In order for racial advocacy to work you need numbers which they lack at this time so stay tuned for future developments.</p>
<p>While whites are becoming more racially aware we still haven&rsquo;t taken any meaningful steps at organizing and formulating a group survival strategy.  That would be tantamount to Nazism so it&rsquo;s best we play the usual anti-racist games and suffer through a genocide which has already commenced.  Barring a miracle or sudden change in our behavior it seems Whites will be relegated to roving bands of vagabonds and outcasts in what used to be the USA.     </p>

<p><br>
It wasn&rsquo;t blacks that pioneered that game.</p>
<p>Who founded the NAACP and ran it until the late 70s?</p>
<p>Who were the majority of the &#8220;freedom riders&#8221;?</p>
<p>Who filled the black;s heads with hate whitey and victimhood propaganda thought tv shows like Roots?</p>

<p>EXACTLY!  I&rsquo;ve posted about the whole &#8220;Roots&#8221; thing before Money, but from another angle.  The one where a family of Whites is cheering on Chicken George and clapping hysterically for the Blacks - while at the same time tearing themselves apart!  </p>
<p>I know for a fact ours was not the only such family, ie; White Families who were sanctimoniously defending abstractions like &#8220;race relations&#8221; while tearing itself apart as a Family through abuse and neglect.  </p>

			<p>This may be the best article I&rsquo;ve seen on AmRen in years.</p>
<p>Finally an article that dispels with the &#8220;Asians are ideal&#8221; myth.  In truth, Asians are a bigger threat to whites in many ways than are blacks or mestizos. </p>

			<p>To Forlorn Artist, regarding your response to me above, given on 4/17/08:</p>
<p>This will be a rather brief and truncated version of my original response to you; for whatever reason, that response (which was posted several times) never went up.</p>
<p>However, her are my key points: </p>
<p>1.) I thanked you for your kind words regarding my writings and their style. Moreover, it is good to know that I can get a laugh out of you from time to time; sometimes I think some miss my intended jokes and innuendoes that are meant to be humorous.</p>
<p>2.) I am the sole John PM here now; differences in my writing styles tend to reflect either my reactions to articles, my general mood, or a combination of the two. There was an imposter problem here awhile ago, but the moderators and the webmaster here helped crush that scurrilous annoyance. </p>
<p>3.) On Asians in high school or otherwise, I have found them to be no more moral and industrious as a group than whites. On the contrary, in some respects they can be very underhanded, arrogant, promiscuous, and/or obtuse depending on the individual or situation in question.</p>
<p>4.) I inquired if you were Asian or part Asian? You seemed to imply this to a point in your response; just wondering here and with no malicious intent.</p>
<p>5.) The war in the Middle East, we will agree to disagree on. I am not for gun barrel &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; building. However, I am for crushing Islamic terrorism and all other forms of anti-Western &ldquo;Marxist Liberationist&rdquo; movements. This is not limited to the PLO and such other &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; spawns of the lands of where Allah&rsquo;s scions thrive, but do include such other progressive sociopolitical debating clubs as the IRA through the ANC.</p>
<p>6.) With that said, we as a country still fret about this issue; since the attacks of 9/11, we are blown about like so many leaves in a Fall wind. Iran and most of the other countries of North Africa and the Middle East, still seem to think that once atomic weaponry is obtained, the West will be finished. It begins with Israel (in their warped &ldquo;minds&rdquo;) and ends with New York and Washington going up like Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Had we detonated a hydrogen bomb over Medina on 9/12/01, and let it be known Mecca would be next on our list, this terrorist rubbish would have stopped! Of course, most more &ldquo;temperate thinking&rdquo; people would hold this &ldquo;might&rdquo; be a disaster, since oil and gas prices might skyrocket, but we all know that this could &ldquo;never&rdquo; happen even if restrained conventional methods were employed in the war on terror.</p>
<p>7.) The hippies&rsquo; bands of the 60s were entertaining enough; however, it is always good to point out, that Jim Morrison was hardly a proponent of that class of &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; substance abusers. He didn&rsquo;t like them in the end, since he was more middleclass then he might have liked to admit. Or put another way, martinis were always more his preference over marijuana.</p>
<p>8.) One of my favorite Poems on sociopolitical matters:</p>
<p>The Second Coming </p>
<p>By William Butler Yeats </p>
<p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre <br>
The falcon cannot hear the falconer; </p>
<p>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; <br>
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, <br>
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere <br>
The ceremony of innocence is drowned; </p>
<p>The best lack all conviction, while the worst <br>
Are full of passionate intensity. <br>
Surely some revelation is at hand; </p>
<p>Surely the Second Coming is at hand. </p>
<p>The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out <br>
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi <br>
Troubles my sight: somewhere in the sands of the desert <br>
A shape with lion body and the head of a man, <br>
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, <br>
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it <br>
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. </p>
<p>The darkness drops again; but now I know <br>
That twenty centuries of stony sleep <br>
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, </p>
<p>And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, <br>
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? </p>
<p>Best Wishes Forlorn Artist,</p>
<p>John PM!<br>
</p>

			<p>John, there are some diabolically intelligent people in this world, such as your imitator! This creative chameleon imitated the entity known as Courtney, too, I understand. I hope that there are now safeguards in place, so that NOBODY will be literarily &#8220;body-snatched&#8221; again (although, perhaps, &#8220;imitation is the highest form of flattery&#8221;?)! </p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I did, like many on this website, take a DNA test, which revealed a small amount of Asian DNA. Many people have wondered if I have some Native American Indian blood, but the DNA test said, &#8220;Asian.&#8221; Those Indian tribes were all different though, so I wonder if there is even a typical Indian DNA? (I, as an experiment, wrote to one of the more extreme White Nationalist groups, asking if I were elibible for membership. No, they said, You are not pure. I suppose I am what they call a &#8220;mongrel&#8221;?)<br>
My father was of Welsh ancestry, and my mother Scots-Irish, so I identify largely as Celtic, while admiring what I have seen of Asians around here, and honoring whatever connection I may have with them.  </p>
<p>Around here, Asians pretty well validate the premise of Rushton in his &#8220;Race, Evolution and Behavior&#8221;  &mdash;  lower crime, lower substance abuse, lower promiscuity and trashy behavior. I must trust my own perceptions, as you must yours  &mdash;  anything else is second-hand.  It is possible, however, that what I am seeing are the &#8220;better&#8221; classes of Asians that are better educated, have better families, etc. That is a possibility. (As an aside, I have noticed that the Chinese are not too fond of the Koreans.)</p>
<p>&#8220;They got the guns, We got the numbers, Gonna win, Yeah, we&rsquo;re takin over&#8221;   &mdash;  Jim Morrison. I would identify Jim as counter-culture (hippy) for back then. I listen to his music now because people like me are NOW the counterculture, against the egalitarian, anti-American, world-meddling establishment. I think Morrison despised the middle-class, because his middle-class mother would not listen to him when he told her, as a boy, that someone had molested him. I can identify with that, and I can understand why Morrison would seek solace in whiskey and marijuana.</p>
<p>I, also, think that the mystical W. B. Yeats was on to something!</p>
<p>You keep posting, John!</p>
