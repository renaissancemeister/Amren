			<p>A little too &#8220;ordinary&#8221; for my taste. </p>
<p>Although it is rather hilarious to compare the &#8220;intolerant&#8221; BNP&rsquo;s message with that of the &#8220;tolerant&#8221; right&rsquo;s. The &#8220;tolerant&#8221; right, if you haven&rsquo;t noiticed, is currently campaigning on a promise of a 100 YEAR WAR with poor, technologically-benighted brown people abroad. And, I may add, an eternal war against rich, technologically-sophisticated white people at home. </p>

AmRen&rsquo;s subhead on this item refers to the BNP going &#8220;very soft sell.&#8221; And perhaps it is. And no doubt the video (and the Party) will be criticized on these boards (and elsewhere) for compromising ideological purity in search of broader appeal. </p>
<p>But I will only congratulate Mr. Griffin &amp; co. on this Youtube advert, and wish them well with it come voting day. The BNP is now at the point where it can make real gains   &mdash;   and this video is (despite its obviously limited budget) precisely the sort of professional, non-frightening communique the Party needs right now to get off the fringe and into the mainstream.  <br>

			<p>James, as you well know, and since you brought it up, McCain wasn&rsquo;t advocating a 100 year war.  He was advocating a long-term presence in Iraq such as we have in Germany, Korea, and Japan, presuming our victory there.</p>
<p>Non ideological sources agree.<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/57sszq" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/57sszq</a><br>
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9207.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9207.html</a></p>
<p>Even the poisonously leftist CBS agrees.<br>
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/04/01/politics/horserace/entry3985914.shtml" rel="nofollow">https://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/04/01/politics/horserace/entry3985914.shtml</a></p>
<p>Let this vicious smear go.</p>
<p>You may disagree with McCain on the war, and like the Marxists, Islamists, and anti-whites, want America to suffer a humiliating defeat and be forced to withdraw, unnecessarily and suicidally handing the enemies of Western Civilization an enormous triumph they could never have won on their own, but that does not entitle you to distort the facts.</p>
<p>Frankly, however, I think he should have been upfront about saying that he wants us to stay and FIGHT as long as it takes, even if it is 100 years.  What else would a proud nation say, let alone the leader of the white, Western world?</p>
<p>Moaning and sobbing that it&rsquo;s just too hard is unworthy of a great people.  Our casualty rate and financial expenditure there is minimal compared to wars of the past.  We need to be at least as tough as our enemies if we wish to survive.<br>

			<p>This party political broadcast was shallow (what else could it be in under 3 minutes?),anodyne and feminised - and therefore exactly right for its purpose. The likelihood that the late John Tyndall, great man though he was, would have hated it is a pretty good indication that its right for its time and place! </p>

			<p>It may be &#8220;soft&#8221; but it says exactly what everyone is thinking, as the lady said in the video.</p>
<p>Let us hope that they make great inroads so that our leaders, now and in the future, speak up and act to protect our great nation.</p>

			<p>The broadcast wasn&rsquo;t meant to appeal to the readers of AR or similar. Their support is assumed.</p>
<p>It was meant for the millions of Brits who are terrified of what&rsquo;s happening to their country, but still hesitant to vote for a party that is constantly vilified by the MSM as thuggish and fascist. if you try to see it in that light it makes a lot more sense.</p>

			<p>One of the reasons Bush Sr won the presidency in &#8216;89 was because of his &#8220;kinder, gentler America&#8221; ad which showed him playing w/ his grandkids.</p>
<p>The ad was so sacharrine it made me gag, yet female voters ate it up.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the BNP is very savvy to put out a thoughtful piece like this featuring female BNP supporters.</p>
<p> I wish Nick Griffin and co. all the best. </p>

			<p>Hey guys you have to understand that the BNP are hated by the elites in England and that means the BNP are always presented as Fascists ans Nazis.The press always promotes the idea that they are racist bigots and the general feeling in the country is that the BNP are too extreme to vote for.This of course is untrue the policies of the BNP make perfect sense,particularly their policies on immigration.</p>
<p>It is important that the BNP present themselves as a moderate and sensible party with policies that the people can have confidence in. The party political broadcast achieved this in my opinion.</p>
<p>The tide may be turning here in England as more people vote BNP. The elections on Thursday could see them enter the mainstream for the first time. I pray to God that this is so.<br>

			<p>The BNP ad is exactly what is needed to send the message that it is not just a bunch of skinheads and football hooligans.<br>
People need to see professionally made non threatening ads like this before they will consider voting for a new Party.<br>
The Major Parties and the traitorous pro immigration crowd should be very afraid of the new BNP.<br>

<p>The problem is that Iraq is not Germany, Korea, or Japan. When WWII ended, there was no long-term insurgency to deal with. The civilians accepted defeat and moved on. Obedience to central authority was part of their culture. This is not the case in Iraq.</p>
<p>In addition, support for an aggressive Middle East policy is not limited to the neocon Right. It also has support on the Left. This is not a Right vs. Left thing.</p>

			<p>  As I said in a previous post, the British will choose respectability before survival. This ad is an important step in giving the BNP that respectability. The video presents the BNP as a devolutionary party, which happens to have a &#8220;sensible&#8221; immigration policy. To be a mainstream party the BNP has to distance itself from its &#8220;racist&#8221; past. I can only wish Nick Griffin and the BNP success in this effort.  </p>

			<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>The BNP has established the idea that &#8220;Yes&#8221; they are &#8220;RACIST&#8221; they are for White British people and kindred people elsewhere, they are on the side of regular/working class/poor Whites in the UK and now they are presenting cleaned images of good things, things that the down and out Whites could be, want to be, is it deceptive advertising?</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>I look at it as similiar to the Great Russian White racialist, nationalist Vladimir Zhironovsky &#8220;Mad Vlad&#8221; renaming his party the &#8220;liberal Democrat Party&#8221; going with the idea that&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can anyone say that LIBERAL DEMOCRATS are EXTREMISTS, RACISTS, HATERS&#8221; and then when groups of Chetnian, Black African exchange students start causing trouble with White girls anywhere in the Russian sphere, they get beaten down by &#8220;Liberal Democrats&#8221;.</p>
<p>:-) LOL</p>
<p>Got to love it!</p>
<p>Nick Griffin is outstanding!</p>
<p>Wish we had something simiiar in America, somthing better than 76 year old libertarians running for President on hope and a prayer platforms of ending all government programs, including social security payments for White elderly in Florida.</p>

<p>&gt; This is a dishonest statment.  McCain was referring to the presence of U.S. military personel in the way Germany still has U.S. military personel, Japan still has U.S. military personel, and KOREA still has U.S. military personel.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re preaching to the wrong group.  I doubt your leftist distortion of the body of McCain&rsquo;s statement will gain any traction to readers here.</p>
<p>I would only agree that U.S. capitalism as it is today is working against the interests of Americans - on all levels from the use of agricultural slaves from Mexico to the out-sourcing of U.S. manufacturing, to the replacement of U.S. citizen trained doctors with four year wonders from places like India.</p>
<p>Time for a new political  party - The American Nationalist Party.  This party would have to recognize that some amount of socialism (government control) is necessary for self-preservation.  It works well if it is on your side.  I lived in Slovenia for several years in the late 1990s.  I can tell you that the social democracy there makes being Slovene - racially and ethnically a benefit.  The government encourages and rewards child bearing for example.  The social medicine cost there is high, but since your brother and cousin and Slovene friends are the beneficiaries, no one resents the taxes.  It is once you feel that you are paying taxes for &#8220;others&#8221; who are complete strangers, in no way relating to you that the resentment over social programs begins - in my opinion.  Anyway, I hope some that read this will understand what I am pointing to.</p>

<p>Four minutes. <a href="/Broadcast_20final-01.mp3" rel="nofollow">https://www.bnp.org.uk/Broadcast%20final-01.mp3</a></p>
<p>In my opinion, a whole nine yards, hole in one bullseye by Nick Griffin, and it probably cost peanuts.</p>

			<p>The US does no need any bases in Germany and Great Britain. It is unlikely Russia will ever invade Western Europe. Russia is not that unreasonable as the Western media likes to show it as. But troops may be needed in Japan and S.Korea due to N.Korea and the growing power of China. This only means more unfortunate and innocent Korean and Japanese girls getting raped by blacks in the US military.</p>
