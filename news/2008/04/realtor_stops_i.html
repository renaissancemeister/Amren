<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Su Casa Realty, one of the biggest real estate agencies catering to Hispanic immigrants in Memphis, has largely stopped selling homes to people without Social Security numbers, often a sign that they are here illegally.</p>
<p>Juan Romo, part owner of the Century 21 franchise, said mortgage programs for people who lack Social Security numbers aren&rsquo;t likely to come back as banks clamp down on credit in response to the sub-prime housing crisis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s increasingly hard for illegal immigrants to keep steady jobs, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think (getting these loans) is going to be more difficult every time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s against the law to enter the country without inspection or overstay a visa, but businesses have been successful in lobbying for lax enforcement.</p>
<p>Many people here illegally use fake documents to get jobs, and some earn enough to buy homes.</p>
<p>But the economic slowdown, particularly in construction labor, may mean fewer illegal immigrants can afford them. And there&rsquo;s anecdotal evidence that many employers are checking documents more carefully and turning illegal immigrants away.</p>
<p>Federal law still allows banks to offer mortgages to illegal immigrants. Banks have typically required these immigrants to present an individual tax identification number, or ITIN.</p>
<p>The federal government issues these numbers so that workers can file income tax forms regardless of their immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Su Casa had been using an ITIN program from the Bank of Bartlett, but Romo said the bank ended the program this year after the mortgage insurer it was using made a national decision to stop insuring the loans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Romo said he&rsquo;s done with ITIN mortgages for now. &#8220;It&rsquo;s better to invest your time with people with bad credit now than with the ITIN number.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Why is it federally endorsed to lend American money to illegal immigrants? Who voted that into law?</p>

			<p>In related news, during the height of the subprime <i>voulez-vous les bon temps roulet</i>, banks were approving mortgages based on 65% of the applicants&rsquo; gross income going to mortgage payments.  Perhaps this is a clue to how desperate the banks were to hand out mortgages to blacks and Hispanics.   Time was that number was 28% back in the more reasonable days.  Now, that we&rsquo;re financially hung over, the number is around 33%.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to invest your time with people with bad credit now than with the ITIN number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, it better to invest your time with individuals who happen to be here legally than those with ITIN numbers.  The current sub-prime crises arose in large part because of a government mandate to supply homes to the poor, minorities and illegals  &mdash;  all groups who happen to be poor risks.  Now that they find that they can&rsquo;t afford to make the payments on houses that they should never have been allowed to purchase, the government, meaning the tax payers, are there to bail them out.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it a crime to &#8220;aid or abet&#8221; an illegal, much less to sell him/her a house?</p>

			<p>I remember being angry at first when banks started making loans to &#8220;undocumented immigrants.&#8221; I realized that, from the lenders point of view, the risks of lending weren&rsquo;t too great. They figured if the aliens got deported then they&rsquo;d get to keep a house that had appreciated in value, with the illegal nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>While I prayed for the banks and mortgage lenders to get their comeuppance I never quite realized it would happen both so quickly and in such a grand manner. When the market started its freefall the borrowers who had made no down payments (a great many of them illegal aliens) saw themselves holding loans on a product now worth more than they were paying, and with no incentive not to walk away. And they did.</p>
<p>Poetic justice indeed.</p>

			<p>So, banks were willing to give loans to illegals&hellip;interesting.  That defies Economics 101 and Common Sense 101. Anytime I tried to get a loan, I had to pass a rigorous examination of my work histroy, credit history etc, because a bank (lender) has to balance risk and needs some assurance of getting their money back.</p>
<p>Did they really think that day-laborers in the country without proper ID or legal status were not a risk?</p>
<p>Or were they planning on mass repossesions of the homes via foreclosures and planning to sell them in a rising market?</p>
<p>And if the market dropped out (as it did) did they already know that the feds would bail them out, courtesy of the American taxpayer?</p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And as April 15th approaches, once again I ask myself &#8220;Is the government spending my $45,000 contribution prudently?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Buying a house is an excruciating process; paying out of pocket for an appraisal, home inspection, termite inspection, closing costs, surveys, verification of income, employment, etc.  Obviously minorities aren&rsquo;t held to the same scrutiny that White borrowers are or the banks wouldn&rsquo;t be in the mess they&rsquo;re in.  This is discriminatory and amounts to unfair banking practices.  </p>
