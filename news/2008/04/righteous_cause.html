						<p>A plaque stands as a reminder of the Colfax Massacre in front of a small town Courthouse, but a few feet away from the landmark a group of black men and women decried the injustices of the massacre and other historic events, they say, will only be healed with reparations.</p>
<p>&#8220;This morning is all about reparations,&#8221; said Johnita Scott a member of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, who traveled from Baton Rouge to join the event Sunday in the Colfax City Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reparations really connect all the dots&#8221; of history and it stand as the natural next step today, Scott said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During Sunday&rsquo;s day-long event the group spoke about learning, researching and educating, particularly black youngsters, about their origins.</p>
<p>Unlike the Jewish children who had to read about their history &mdash; and received some reparations, black children in the U.S. have not learned about their history in the traditional classroom. And they don&rsquo;t know about the price their ancestors paid as slaves, said keynote speaker Antoinette Harrell, a Louisiana genealogist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said that the approximately $10,000 she has spent in research should be part of reparations, as should be any DNA testing needed to trace black genealogy.</p>
<p>Caseptla Bailey, the mother of &#8220;Jena Six&#8221; defendant Robert Bailey Jr., also was at the event. She presented a DVD about the events surrounding the case.</p>
<p>Diana Kimble, of the coalition said the Jena Six case and the Colfax massacre intersect because they are both about injustices against the black race.</p>
<p>Kimble said, if reparations (40 acres and 1 mule) had been addressed in the past healing would be well on its way, because it would bring about respect and dignity to blacks who worked and continue working to build Louisiana without being paid back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reparations are the key to all of the injustices,&#8221; Kimble, adding that reparations are not a handout but are necessary to correct a great wrong.<br>

<p>Sums it all up really.</p>
<p>Whites are surely owed reparations by blacks as well.  Whites have been economic slaves all this time, having the majority of their paycheck taken at gunpoint to finance grandiose social engineering schemes that have been universally 100% unsuccessful.  When are blacks going to repay these hundreds of billions of dollars?</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Kimble, adding that reparations are not a handout but are necessary to correct a great wrong&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8216;great wrong&rsquo; has been righted to the tune of 500,000+ mostly White lives lost in the Civil War. Where&rsquo;s black gratitude for that?</p>
<p>Blacks have received &#8216;reparations&rsquo; AND outright hand-outs  &mdash;  as in 40 trillion tax dollars.</p>
<p>As Pat Buchanan writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;no people anywhere has done more to lift up blacks than white Americans. Untold trillions have been spent since the &rsquo;60s on welfare, food stamps, rent supplements, Section 8 housing, Pell grants, student loans, legal services, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African-American community into the mainstream. </p>
<p>Governments, businesses and colleges have engaged in discrimination against white folks &mdash; with affirmative action, contract set-asides and quotas &mdash; to advance black applicants over white applicants.</p>
<p>We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude?..&#8221;</p>

			<p>Black children haven&rsquo;t been taught about their own history in traditional classrooms??!? What planet is she on? When students select MLK and Rosa Parks as the two most influential &#8220;Americans&#8221;, then she had better take a second look at the &#8220;new and politically correct&#8221; American history texts.</p>
<p>As far as reparations correcting a great wrong: they have received reparations in various forms since arriving on the North American continent. When, where, and how will this rubbish end?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reparations are the key to all of the injustices&rdquo; yeah right.  Your ilk have been receiving &#8220;reparations&#8221; for the past 50 years as I see it, and given the great Obamanation, I sure things are looking even rosier for your group. </p>
<p>We blue eyed devils might as well just leave cots at work and stop taking any time off.  The way things are going, we are going to be the slaves working for the black mastas.  Hold onto to your wallets- times will be getting even tougher.</p>

			<p>I would HAPPILY endorse giving blacks reparations.  Every black family should be given 40 acres and a mule&hellip;.in Zimbabwe.  Then forcibly relocated and a permanent ban on any further money or support in any form instituted.  Reparations, paid in full, exactly as promised.  The matter ended forever afterward.</p>

			<p>Great, start with Spain, the first country to import slaves officially to this continent. Then, next in line, would be the African Blacks and Arabs responsible for providing the slaves to be had. Then, you can go ahead and tax the DEMOCRATIC party of America for all pay-outs as it was the Whig/Republican party that launched a war (mind you the ONLY war waged in American history over a specific people)to free you. Once this is done, any White families that lost members to the civil war should be first to grab from the pot o&rsquo; money the Democrats will have to cough up, plus interest.</p>
<p>Now, go cry me another one.</p>

			<p>Reparations are the natural first step to extortion by the black people. No reparations should ever be given. Nothing was ever done to them that would ever require such a nonsensical thing. They were brought here after they were sold into slavery by their OWN people. Their life spans were tripled, and they live much better here than they would had they been left in Africa. I think they should all be given a one-way ticket to Liberia.</p>

			<p>They do need to know History.  The blacks were given a choice to go home or stay here.  Obviously, that was a mistake.  </p>
<p>Since their ancestors chose to stay, they are owed nothing.</p>
<p>I can promise the blacks this, if the Government ever decided to give them reparations, I will immediately stop paying taxes.  I will go to jail.  They get enough of my money, it&rsquo;s called Welfare.  They also get jobs and promotions they are unqualified for.  That is reparations.     </p>

			<p>I hustle, therefore I am (black). Why don&rsquo;t they just erect a billboard stating, &#8220;As a race we are incapable of producing as much as we&rsquo;d like to consume.&#8221; Blacks on their own have failed to create prosperity anywhere in the world and these ingrates imagine that the white man has hindered the blacks&rsquo; great advancement towards prosperity. It&rsquo;s laughable and also sad that these people can convince themselves of absolutely anything without a shred of evidence supporting their position.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll support reparations any day if all racial policies are ended and freedom of association is reinstated.  If I can live in an all white town and send my kids to an all white school I&rsquo;ll accept a 10% increase in my taxes.  I just don&rsquo;t want to live around blacks or Hispanics.  A few Asians in the neighborhood is OK but I&rsquo;ll literally pay to not have to live near blacks.</p>

			<p>If you start to think of your physical and moral condition, you usually find that you are sick. <br>

<p>I would add that white liberals have allowed blacks the luxury of blaming someone for their sickness.  Also, as someone said on this site once before, over 70% of black Americans are mixed race, therefore they need to demand reparations from themselves.  <br>

			<p>Reparations come with, ONLY with, Repatriation. You want the money? Renounce your citizenship, and take your check and one way ticket back to africa. </p>
<p> If things are so bad here, Ghana or Nigeria or Zimbabwe would be heaven to the american black. You would be free of the &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; and back in the motherland! Few racist whites to bother you there, and plenty of opportunity to start that farm, or ranch in a black governed country!  However, if you want to stay, get to work and shut up like the rest of us.</p>
<p> Nobody hands me a blessed thing. I work, I got a good job because I studied and graduated and worked hard. I started my own business to cover my taxes!  Why is uncle sam picking my pocket so you can sleep in and not work? How did this get to be my problem? And just how much do you think you deserve for this injustice that NEVER happened to you personally? How much do I send Oprah? Micael Jordan? Does Obama, or Halle Berry get half as much for being half white? We need answers here.. <br>
 </p>
<p>  If reparations would actually get the &#8220;Black-injustice-life-sucks-to-be-black-in-america&#8221; industry/pimps  to shut up and never have to hear this again, it would likely be worth it. If blacks would get up and go to work in the morning, and not trash their/my neighborhood and not destroy what others have built up,  I might even agree to it. As it stands, NO WAY!! </p>
<p>  Note to black &#8216;leaders&rsquo;: You had best dial up the liberal white guilt, because in 20 years when the hispanics are making decisions at the ballot box, you wont have a prayer of getting reparations when they run the show. They dont have the guilt, and a lot of them look down on you. </p>

			<p>Reparations have already been paid. Six hundred thousand soldiers, almost all white, died in the brutal Civil War which ended slavery. And this in a total U.S. population which was then less than thirty-five million.<br>
Financial reparations will be paid around the time the descendants of Loyalists who fled to Britain or Canada during the Revolution get compensation for their confiscated property. In other words, no time soon.</p>

<p><br>
&gt; I always react to this comparison with disgust.  There is no comparison of the rarer, various individual acts of physical harm done to blacks in slavery to the planned and nearly completed genocide of an entire WHITE ethnic group in Europe during WW2.  AND the reparations that were given had to be done during the lifetimes of those survivors of the actual atrocities, not their fifth and beyond genealogical descendants!!!</p>
<p>(And many of those survivors lived within the Soviet Bloc after WW2 and never got a penny.  Most have died in poverty.)<br>

			<p> Slavery is a blight that left its scar on all of humanity, yet it was the whites that banned it. Slavery was sanctioned in the Bible and was legal in early America. America paid a very dear price for it in the un-civil war and still pays for it with the huge costs of violent suffering in inter racial crimes blacks often commit, as well as the huge costs of maintaining such large populations of blacks in prisons, not to mention trying to educate them&hellip; Unfortunately the dignified black people that would despise handouts and pity are not the ones that get the attention, but instead their less dignified brethren ruin it. It is true that most healthy whites prefer company of their own kind but have&rsquo;nt blacks prospered here in ways impossible in Africa? Must we dig up old bones? If the answer is yes then isn&rsquo;t the greater onus on those that prostituted their own people to foreigners without concern of their welfare? As blacks made commerce of their neigbors via slavery. There would be a lot more peace between the races if they stay with their own women and let the old bones of contention remain burried.</p>

			<p>As an actual victim of violent black crime, I am far more entitled to &#8220;reparations&#8221; than this group is.</p>
<p>In August of 2004, while working as morning assistant manager of a Subway sandwich store, my co-worker and I were held up at gunpoint by a black robber.</p>
<p>He asked whether we were hiring, and I told him we were, because a lot of the day crew was either heading back to high school or off to college over the next few weeks.  I gave him an application and told him the store manager would be in at about 11:30.  Then he pulled out his gun.  </p>
<p>I got a very good look straight down the muzzles of his stainless derringer.  The bore was dirty, which told me he had been shooting it.  This actually gave me some hope, as a handgun with little grips like that HURTS when .357&#8221; Magnums are fired, so I figured he probably had .38&#8221; Specials in it.</p>
<p>He marched us back into the office, and we gave him the money in the store; about $460, plus whatever was in the cash register.  The cotton shirt I was wearing felt very thin as he marched us down the hallway.</p>
<p>He had us turn to face the wall, and I thought, &#8220;Oh, s***, here it comes.&#8221;  I suspected he would shoot me first, since my co-worker was pretty, and was trying to figure out a way to make him use both shells on me, as a 38 year-old ex-con counts for less than an 18 year-old college girl, but he didn&rsquo;t shoot us, but quickly left.</p>
<p>I locked the office door in case he came back, and turned off the lights so he couldn&rsquo;t see in to shoot us through the door or wall, while my co-worker started crying.  It was her last day at work before going off to start her freshman year at Brigham Young University.  I patted her on the back and told her &#8220;We&rsquo;re OK, we made it,&#8221; as the hug I thought of giving the poor thing might have been construed in the wrong way.</p>
<p>The police came right away, as our robber had tripped the silent alarm while looting the register.  They called the owner, who arrived shortly.  He said my face was a dead-looking gray color, and that he was scared just looking at me.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t get anything for having the scare of my life, but the robber got caught, which is at least something.  He had driven from Albequerque to Denver on I-25, robbing small restaurants along the way.  He got us the morning of the second day, heading home.  He&rsquo;s doing seven years in the New Mexico DOC, and when he&rsquo;s done with that, he&rsquo;ll get more time in Colorado.</p>
<p>Sometimes, one just has to suck this stuff down and get over it.</p>
