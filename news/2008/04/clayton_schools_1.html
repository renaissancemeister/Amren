<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Clayton County&rsquo;s new superintendent can spend almost half of his 14-month contract not working and still get paid.</p>
<p>John W. Thompson&rsquo;s contract grants him the option to spend 107 of his 240 workdays &mdash; 45 percent &mdash; on vacation, holiday or doing consulting work.</p>
<p>Thompson, who started work Monday, is tasked with meeting the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools&rsquo; Sept. 1 deadline to overhaul the district or lose accreditation.</p>
<p>But that deadline is going to be awfully tight given Thompson&rsquo;s contract, said James E. Bostic Jr., a state board of education member appointed by the governor to help Clayton schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clayton is paying Thompson $285,000 a year &mdash; or $1,187.50 a day.</p>
<p>Bostic and fellow governor&rsquo;s liaison William &#8220;Brad&#8221; Bryant have said Thompson is not capable of saving Clayton&rsquo;s accreditation. The president of SACS has said the same thing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thompson&rsquo;s contract grants him the perks of all Clayton County administrators: 20 paid days like winter break, 15 holidays and 18 vacation days.</p>
<p>But unlike other Clayton school administrators and past superintendents, Thompson also has 30 additional paid vacation days and two paid days a month to do consulting work outside the district.</p>
<p>That special consulting time does not include the time Thompson can attend educational conferences across the nation. Under the contract, he doesn&rsquo;t have to use vacation time for that.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The $285,000 salary is lower than what Thompson requested, Hopson told the board. But when other benefits are added in, the contract is costing the district about $400,000.</p>
<p>Thompson gets $2,000 a month for housing and $28,500 in a tax-sheltered annuity.</p>
<p>On July 1, Thompson will get a raise. He will get the same percentage rate as the highest group of certified school employees. That means if teachers get a 4 percent raise and paraprofessionals get a 6 percent raise, Thompson will get the 6 percent raise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in addition to use of a car and security, if needed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thompson will be paid a lump check when he leaves for any unused time, which is another way to bump up his salary, said Sid Chapman, president of Clayton&rsquo;s largest teachers&rsquo; union.</p>
<p>Chapman said he has been flooded with calls from teachers concerned about Thompson&rsquo;s salary, time off and &#8220;unrestricted&#8221; powers, which allow him to supersede board policies. The union has requested a meeting with Thompson, but not received a response.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems like a great deal of money and time off, especially since he didn&rsquo;t seem to have a plan,&#8221; said Chapman, who represents about 2,800 teachers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Corporations routinely pay high price tags for executives to rescue troubled companies, including lofty stock packages, cars and other options.</p>

					<p>&#8220;The $285,000 salary is lower than what Thompson requested, Hopson told the board.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every other affirmative action hire will be on about a high school sophmore level, so since Thompson will qualify as a high school graduate on a good day, of course he will demand more.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s at least smart enough to understand if the dumb leftist honkeys are stupid enough to pay big money for less than mediocrity they&rsquo;re stupid enough to be fleeced a little further with more demands.</p>

					<p>This is so typical. These people seem to think that a job is all about getting paid and it shouldn&rsquo;t matter that they not only don&rsquo;t have the skills needed for the job but often leave things in an even bigger mess that white tax payers will be forced to pay to fix.  </p>

					<p>Get ready.  This story is just a taste of what a black (or minority) and white liberal run country is going to be like.</p>
<p>What a scam!  Our tax dollars and it doesn&rsquo;t seem that we can do anything about it.</p>
<p>How much do you think this guy could make on his own?  And I mean without being a &#8220;diversity advisor&#8221; or some such rot.</p>
<p>I mean how much could he earn relying on what he knows?  Could he offer someone somethinge they willing will to pay for with their hard earned money?  Probably next n,ot but this is what government does for these hacks.</p>
<p>How do we stop this stuff?  Hold on to your wallets.</p>

					<p>Of course, this guys contract is absurd. Having said that, after seeing him, I think he should be given more mandatory time off. That way, he&rsquo;ll be able to do a lot less damage.</p>

					<p>Blacks will ride something like this out for as long as they can (because they &#8216;deserve&rsquo; it). When someone tries to change their free money coming in, they&rsquo;ll make some bogus claim that some idiots will fight to uphold. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that others, as well as blacks, see how far they can take something before they&rsquo;re caught. That&rsquo;s what out world has come to.</p>

					<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between Dr. Thompson and the extravagantly paid <span class="caps">CEO</span>s and presidents of companies? Oh wait, those are private companies even though the government subsidizes them with tax dollars and tax breaks. </p>

					<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t pay taxes; that&rsquo;s why this stuff enrages non-blacks, who DO pay taxes, and why Blacks are always on the lookout for <span class="caps">FREE </span>money.</p>
<p>There is absolutely NO downside to Black corruption vis-a-vis Whitey from the black&rsquo;s standpoint.</p>

					<p>Clayton County has really deteriorated.  In 1980, Clayton County was about 90% white.  In 1990, it was 73% white.  In 2000, it was down to 37% white.  Today, it is only about 17% white.  The county is almost eighty percent black.</p>
<p>How has Clayton County changed?</p>
<p>-The schools are some of the worst performing in the state.<br>
-Crime levels are some of the highest in the state.<br><br>
-Neighborhood blight is becoming ever-more pervasive.<br><br>
-Whites have cleared out rather quickly.<br><br>

					<p>Not everything can be solved by throwing money at the problem.  What happens when Thompson departs his position and things are markedly worse than before?</p>
<p>The problem is not lack of resources, badly structed school heirarchy or any other excuse.  The problem is the majority of blacks are unwilling and/or unable to go to school to meet the educational standards that are expected in society.  While they are forced to go, they cause major problems for students trying to better themselves while posing a security risk to everyone around them because of their hyperaggressiveness and pack behaviour.</p>
<p>There is simply no palatable solution to this problem which worsens every year, forming a permanent underclass forever dependent on welfare.  It is much simpler for people to throw money at the symptoms, avert their eyes, and send their own children to homogeneous private schools.</p>

<p><br>
I bet if you gave them all a bunch of objective tests, Dr. Thompson would come out as dimwitted.  I realize this is a minor difference, but the only one I can think of at the moment - with the exception of maybe melanin content.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Classic non-economic thinking. <span class="caps">CEO&rsquo;</span>s arent paid by performance for the simple reason that it is hard to quantify what they do. Paying them by performance would make them risk-averse, which, presumably, would be bad for the company. </p>
<p>After all, if a company <span class="caps">DOES NOT </span>make an <strong>increased</strong> profit, the shareholders wouldnt know what they were missing. It would be invisible because it never happened.</p>
<p>No super regulating agency told private companies that they give <span class="caps">CEO</span>s huge cash bonuses without regard to performance. The companies did it on their on. Seeing how its the dominant way to reward <span class="caps">CEO</span>s, it suggests it was the outcome of hard won experience rather than armchair socialism</p>

The President appoints thousands of high government jobs. Will the same ting happen on a much higher scale?</p>
