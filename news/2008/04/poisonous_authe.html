<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The list of Afrocentric &#8220;educators&#8221; whom the Rev. Jeremiah Wright has invoked in his media escapades since Sunday is a disturbing reminder that academia&rsquo;s follies can enter the public world in harmful ways. Now the pressing question is whether they have entered Barack Obama&rsquo;s worldview as well.</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p>At the NAACP meeting, Mr. Wright proudly propounded the racist contention that blacks have inherently different &#8220;learning styles,&#8221; correctly citing as authority for this view Janice Hale of Wayne State University. Pursuing a Ph.D. by logging long hours in the dusty stacks of a library, Mr. Wright announced, is &#8220;white.&#8221; Blacks, by contrast, cannot sit still in class or learn from quiet study, and they have difficulty learning from &#8220;objects&#8221; &mdash; books, for example &mdash; but instead learn from &#8220;subjects,&#8221; such as rap lyrics on the radio. These differences are neurological, according to Ms. Hale and Mr. Wright: Whites use what Mr. Wright referred to as the &#8220;left-wing, logical and analytical&#8221; side of their brains, whereas blacks use their &#8220;right brain,&#8221; which is &#8220;creative and intuitive.&#8221; When he was of school age in Philadelphia following the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 1954 desegregation decision, Mr. Wright said, his white teachers &#8220;freaked out because the black children did not stay in their place, over there, behind the desk.&#8221; Instead, the students &#8220;climbed up all over [the teachers], because they learned from a &lsquo;subject,&rsquo; not an &lsquo;object.&rsquo; &#8221; How one learns from a teacher as &#8220;subject&#8221; by climbing on her, as opposed to learning from her as &#8220;object&#8221; &mdash; by listening to her words &mdash; is a mystery.</p>
<p>{snip} Embracing the notion that blacks shouldn&rsquo;t be expected to listen attentively to instruction is guaranteed to perpetuate into eternity the huge learning gap between blacks on the one hand, and whites and Asians on the other.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Mr. Wright also praised the work of Geneva Smitherman of Michigan State University, who has called for the selective incorporation of Ebonics into the curriculum in order to validate the black experience. Mr. Wright gave another shout-out to the late Asa Hilliard of Georgia State University, who told us, Mr. Wright said, &#8220;how to fix the schools.&#8221; Like Ms. Hale, Mr. Hilliard argued that disrupting the classroom through &#8220;impulsive interrupting and loud talking&#8221; is inherently black. His bogus Afrocentrism, propounded in his &#8220;African-American Baseline Essays,&#8221; metastasized in educational circles during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Mr. Hilliard argued that Western civilization was at once stolen from black Africa and crippling to black identity. As the late Arthur M. Schlesinger recounted in his 1991 alarum about multiculturalism, &#8220;The Disuniting of America,&#8221; Mr. Hilliard urged schools to teach black students that Egypt was a black country; that Africans invented birth control and carbon steel; that they discovered America long before Columbus did; that Robert Browning and Ludwig von Beethoven were &#8220;Afro-European&#8221;; and that the Atlantic Ocean was originally named the Ethiopian Ocean. {snip}</p>
<p>Approving of self-destructive behavior in school is just one part of the vast academic project to justify black underclass dysfunction. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>{snip} But the white elite&rsquo;s desire to avoid charges of racism cancels out all reasonable reactions to dangerous nonsense when such nonsense comes out of black mouths. The coverage of Mr. Wright&rsquo;s speeches beyond the Times has been just as silent about their crackpot Afrocentric pedagogy, meekly following the agenda that Mr. Wright set by asking instead whether the black church, and not Mr. Wright, was under attack.</p>
<p>{snip} It is imperative that someone ask Mr. Obama whether he, too, believes that the way to &#8220;fix the schools&#8221; is through Afrocentric curricula and double standards in student discipline, and whether he, too, believes that blacks only think with the &#8220;right side&#8221; of their brains.<br>

			<p>Wow! Who&rsquo;s the &#8220;true believer&#8221; here, Jeremiah Wright or Heather Mac Donald? I&rsquo;m really starting to wonder.</p>
<p>This is about the 19th &#8220;hard-line&#8221; conservative article I&rsquo;ve read on the Rev. Wright controversy, and in each and every one of them the author has vehemently denied any cognitive differences between blacks and whites. </p>

			<p>If blacks can have Ebonics Whites should be able to Aryanonics. For example one should say &#8220;pardon me&#8221; instead of &#8220;excuse me&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Regardless of which part of the brain blacks use to learn, it is safe to say that it is under utilized, with tens of thousands of years to prove it. The reality Blacks live in is truly different, it&rsquo;s like they are just slightly out of phase with the rest of the world, or they create their own reality to fit their existance, using bits and pieces of others history and culture, (Christianity, discovering mathematics, or America. for example) That so many Blacks share these beliefs and their own reality is dangerous. Is it possible that a large percentage of the Blacks are sociopaths? there are so many parallels between the Black race and the common sociopath profile. It would explain a lots of things</p>

			<p>I happen to agree with Reverend Wright on this subject; most blacks have inherently different minds. Reading books *is* white, which is why I have a houseful of books, but will not toleate &#8220;rap&#8221; being played in my presence (as an aside, can we please go back to beginning that word with a &#8220;c&#8221;?)  I suppose it *might* be possible to earn a Doctorate of Profanity by listening to enough rap, and blacks should be encuraged, by any means necessary, to pursue this least harmful of their natural inclinations.</p>
<p>As for black elementary school students being admitted by Hale and Wright as being unable to sit behind a desk, and &#8220;climbing all over their teachers&#8221;, perhaps this could be remedied by planting some trees in the classrooms, provided they don&rsquo;t fling too much poop at the other students.</p>

			<p>Can you imagine this kind of &#8220;politically correct&#8221; nonsense goes unchallenged in the so-calld mainstream media, and is even supported by &#8220;scientists&#8221; at American universities. I guess, the &#8220;progressives&#8221; managed to move the science clock back some 500 years to dark ages of Inquisition and obstruction of truth discovery. And all this is happening in 21st century in the most technologically and intellectually advanced country. </p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s enough reason to vote against any liberal candidate in each and every one election I am eligible to participate.<br>

			<p>First is this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the white elite&rsquo;s desire to avoid charges of racism cancels out all reasonable reactions to dangerous nonsense when such nonsense comes out of black mouths.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Clearly, this is a statement that almost all AR aficionados universally agree with. In fact, I would argue that if AR did a poll and asked its website readers and posters what was the most dangerous threat to white America, the putridity of the white elite&rsquo;s perpetuating of multiculturalism in all of its forms, including allowing Afrocentric idiocy to go unchallenged, would resoundingly defeat all other categories. It is the groveling duplicity of our so-called &ldquo;elites&rdquo; that fuels the entire breakdown of racial and socioeconomic stability in this country; from illegal &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; to forced integration, from affirmative action to diversity babble, the core problem is the &ldquo;anointed&rdquo; white Marxist multiculturalists. Without their petty: histrionics, hysterias, and hypocrisies, this country and our civilization would not be facing the looming disaster that it is currently. </p>
<p>Second, and related to the above is this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead, the students &lsquo;climbed up all over [the teachers], because they learned from a &lsquo;subject,&rsquo; not an &lsquo;object.&rsquo; &rdquo; How one learns from a teacher as &lsquo;subject&rsquo; by climbing on her, as opposed to learning from her as &lsquo;object&rsquo; &mdash; by listening to her words &mdash; is a mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not once have I heard this portion of the Comrade Reverend Wright&rsquo;s tirades mentioned in the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media. Not once, have I heard it even remotely challenged and reduced to the clear absurdity it is. That is because to do so, would leave one open to a charge of (gasp) &ldquo;racism;&rdquo; this being because (and you will notice, even Miss Mac Donald cannot bring herself to do it) one would have to point out that he makes black children sound more like animals than humans. No Klansman or Nazi, could put better into words the stereotype of blacks as being base and irrational within the educational system, when compared to Caucasians and Asians. Moreover, it clearly makes the case for total and unrelenting segregation to be instituted throughout our society, since these styles of incompatible learning and reasoning are so divergent, that they could not possibly be simply isolated only to our classrooms.</p>
<p>Finally, is this:  </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is imperative that someone ask Mr. Obama whether he, too, believes that the way to &lsquo;fix the schools&rsquo; is through Afrocentric curricula and double standards in student discipline, and whether he, too, believes that blacks only think with the &lsquo;right side&rsquo; of their brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Logically this is true, but apparently our political and media &ldquo;elites&rdquo; only think with the right sides of their brains as well; they have and continue to overtly softball and covertly hard sell the Obamania that has begun to derail. They refuse to ask such hardball questions (including that gushing Obamaniac Chris Matthews of a show by the same name) of this nebulous and untested demigod of their cult. Far more focused are they on how soon will Comrade Wright &ldquo;go away&rdquo; if ever, and how damaged by him will Comrade Obama be, if or when the fallout of this &ldquo;turbulent priest&rdquo; fades away?</p>
<p>They are committed to him and the &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; they expect of him; not even Hillary can compete, in their insanely convoluted multicultural weltanschauung. </p>
<p>And that is the scary part, since while she is certainly no prize to the racially awakened by any stretch of the imagination, she is one of them and should be their viable alternative.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>From the article;<br>
When he was of school age in Philadelphia following the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 1954 desegregation decision, Mr. Wright said, his white teachers &ldquo;freaked out because the black children did not stay in their place, over there, behind the desk.&rdquo; Instead, the students &ldquo;climbed up all over [the teachers], because they learned from a &lsquo;subject,&rsquo; not an &lsquo;object.&rsquo; &rdquo; </p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s all the black students did, the teachers should consider themselves lucky. As a graduate of the Philadelphia school system, I can truthfully say that the only things the black students were interested in learning were how to rob and cheat their fellow students, and new reasons to hate Whitey. Race riots at South Philadelphia High School were common when the weather warmed up. It was common to have the city send in a busload or two of Philadelphia police officers to break up those riots which occurred in the late sixties.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright&rsquo;s monologue is another failed attempt to explain away black failure as something other than what it is, the genetic predisposition for blacks to be an uneducable race of violent persons with no respect for anyone else.</p>
<p>From the article;<br>
Mr. Hilliard urged schools to teach black students that Egypt was a black country; that Africans invented birth control and carbon steel; that they discovered America long before Columbus did; that Robert Browning and Ludwig von Beethoven were &ldquo;Afro-European&rdquo;; and that the Atlantic Ocean was originally named the Ethiopian Ocean. {snip}</p>
<p>These bold lies will only give blacks another reason to hate Whitey (as if they needed another reason). I can&rsquo;t imagine that any educated person would make such a stupid suggestion to alter history. As I said before however, these people are uneducable. Mr Hilliard and those of his ilk just prove that every day.</p>

			<p>Ethiopia is on the far east of the African continent. I am really curious why he thinks the Atlantic should be named the Ethiopian ocean. Perhaps they don&rsquo;t realize this because there are no geography books written with Ebonics</p>

			<p>This is one time I have to vehemently DISAGREE with Michael C. Scott. Because our White majority should emphatically not have to conform to the Black mentality, but Blacks MUST conform to OUR standards. That this is neither unrealistic nor impossible has been demonstrated by far too many successful Blacks   &mdash;   who achieved success in the business world, the military and other areas.</p>
<p>If is NOT that Blacks can&rsquo;t learn from books, it&rsquo;s that THEY DO NOT WANT TO LEARN! How many successful Blacks does it take, to refuse that insane theory?</p>

			<p>I suppose one could formulate the large mean IQ difference between whites and blacks by saying that blacks learn differently.  It would, however, be more precise to say that they are unable to learn to the same extent that whites can because of a lack of intellectual capacity.</p>
<p>The fact that the bizzaro wold of the Reverend is fairly typical of American blacks says a great deal about them and about how they are unsuited to citizenship in a representative democracy.  Perhaps this is why they always vote overwhelmingly Democratic.</p>
<p>Although I find it difficult to believe that Obama believes all of the racial nonsense accepted by most American blacks, one thing that he clearly does believe is that whites are evil and that blacks are their victims.  He also believes a great deal of pseudo-Marxist rubbish that only an affirmative action mulatto could take seriously.  The same goes for his black wife with all of her affirmative action Harvard degrees and six figure income. </p>
<p> Imagine a world filled with violent racial anti-white hatred and paranoid superstitions everywhere and you will get a glimpse into the world view of not only the majority of American blacks but of Obama as well.  That such an individual would be seriously considered a candidate for the presidency says a great deal about how far this society had degenerated over the last half century.</p>

			<p>First off kudos to Ms. Macdonald for writing this and other politically incorrect columns. She&rsquo;s one of the best out there right now.</p>
<p>Second from this article you have to understand that these and other crazy ideas are embraced by academia, especially the most esteemed of American society. If we truly are to have a free market of ideas and let this nonsense be heard we should also be able to express the views that if you dig deep into this website you will find. Ideas that ALSO explain black learning differences, crime rates, etc.</p>

He is less of a preacher than my Dog and probably not as smart. But the liberal media, in love with B. Hussin, will say &#8220;let&rsquo;s move on&#8221; as though Obama is not a racist himself.</p>

			<p>I have always noticed that black kids are running, screaming and otherwise disruptive in class. If you try to stop the behavior you are labled a racist. This would be a great reason for the black churches to start schools for black kids, get them away from the white kids that they hate and love to torture so that they can be taught in a way that suits their individual learning style as per &#8220;rev&#8221; Wright. </p>

			<p>Is Barack Obama as nutty as Jeremiah Wright?  Well let&rsquo;s have a peek at his parents and grand-parents first.  His grand-parents named his mother &#8216;Stanley&rsquo;.  &#8216;Stanley&rsquo; was a habitual miscegenatress.  It&rsquo;s obvious she hated White men as is demonstrated by her willingness to have babies with any man except a White one.  His father was absent most of the time and was having children with two different women simultaneously.  We might expect someone who is the offspring of folks like this to be a little unusual, but Barack Obama is smooth and polished. One of the reasons why he is smooth and polished is because the media continues to give him a free ride, and he knows it.  But his craziness is well-concealed on the surface.  We do know he is Muslim at heart.  We know he is Black at heart.  We know instinctively that he does support Rev. Wright - no matter what he says otherwise.  And we know in our hearts that once he becomes President, crime will rapidly increase, probably at a rate higher than we&rsquo;ve ever seen, as Blacks feel empowered to stick it to &#8216;Crackers&rsquo; even more.  More affirmative action, more quotas, more Black on White violence, more White guilt, more immigration, both legal and illegal, more insanity, more of all the worst things.  Wake up time for people of European descent.</p>

			<p>[Whites use what Mr. Wright referred to as the &ldquo;left-wing, logical and analytical&rdquo; side of their brains, whereas blacks use their &ldquo;right brain,&rdquo; which is &ldquo;creative and intuitive.&rdquo; ]</p>
<p>Nonsense.  Blacks are just as deficient in creativity as they are in thinking logically.  If somebody can come up with anything blacks have accomplished creatively I&rsquo;d be amazed.</p>
<p>[But one thing is clear: embracing the notion that blacks shouldn&rsquo;t be expected to listen attentively to instruction is guaranteed to perpetuate into eternity the huge learning gap between blacks on the one hand, and whites and Asians on the other.]</p>
<p>Listening attentively and behaving in class will have no effect whatsoever on the so-called learning gap, because it isn&rsquo;t a learning gap but an intelligence gap.</p>
<p>Since nothing can be done to add to black intelligence, there will be a &#8220;gap&#8221; forever, or until we divide this country up into racial enclaves so we can get rid of these wretched failures who are prone to crime and violence.</p>
<p>Has anybody thought to ask this Wright that if it is just systemic black/white differences in teaching and the like, why do blacks fail in all black countries, and why are their crime rates so high in Haiti and Africa?</p>
<p>Blacks fail in Western societies and they are prone to crime and violence, because they are made that way.  It&rsquo;s the elephant in the room no one dares to mention, because most whites are too wimpish to do so. </p>

Exactly. And all of this is happening, because those Whites mentioned in Tony&rsquo;s post fear that if the truth gets out then us Whites will storm the Palace, so to speak, and take back the power, as the expression goes.  And do you know why they fear that? Because they know full well that it would be the only reasonable thing to do, especially after what we&rsquo;ve all been through. And this is especially true for poor Whites, who have been cruelly, inexcusably, irresponsibily scapegoated for over half a century by those very Whites Tony mentions in his posts.</p>

<p>Blacks are not capable nor desire to be advanced. Some can be civilized but the majority is not able to live in a civilized society. They need to go back to the bush for their own and the world&rsquo;s sanity. Let&rsquo;s put low iq blacks in africa and isolate them so they can go back to their natural habitat. We can visit them surreptitiously to observe them as anthropologists and as eco tourists. Let them forget about the outside world.</p>

I could get cranked off on this subject and wouldn&rsquo;t know when to stop. This man simply has many more reasons why he shouldn&rsquo;t be our president than the blank resume&rsquo; that he presents. &#8220;White guilt&#8221; and liberalism(which is a mental disorder) explain Obamamania. As some one said before, if this closet Muslim and Marxist IS or IS NOT elected, they&rsquo;ll be violence from coast to coast. Keep the powder dry and God help us all.</p>

Nice post.  The only thing I would add, or, the only correction I would make Burt is that it&rsquo;s not just a half a century.  It&rsquo;s much, much, longer.  No one has been more explited, and scapegoated than poor whites.  This is something the Left tends to forget, on purpose.  </p>
<p>I mean, really, who do you think Marx wrote The Communist Manifesto FOR?  Blacks?  Mexicans?  Yes, he said &#8220;Workers of the World Unite.&#8221;  The problem in his case was, he didn&rsquo;t know any colored people.  Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, I mean, People of Color. I forgot it&rsquo;s against the law to use those words in the form of a compound noun.  But it&rsquo;s ok to use it as a compound phrase (does it get anymore twisted?).</p>
<p>But then again, as far as ole Marx is concerned.  Not only did he not know any peoples of color, he didn&rsquo;t know any Workers either.  And most White workers don&rsquo;t want to spend their lives remembering how long they have been marginalized and subjegated, which for them is of course - THOUSANDS OF YEARS!!!!</p>
<p>They just want to live in a system that will enable them to grow and prosper.  They found it, for a time, and now it is being aggressively, arrogantly, and, as you said Burt, irresponsibly, taken away from them.</p>

			<p>There are many whites who learn with their &#8220;right brain&#8221; as well. They are often highly intelligent and very creative. </p>
<p>Yes, they sometimes DO have trouble in school because they are not as patient and linear as &#8220;left brain&#8221; whites. BUT - right brained whites have no trouble reading and are often some of our best writers and novelists. </p>

<p>It reminded me of a quote from Nietzsche.  It is not exact, but close enough.  He said, in so many words, that, anyone who thinks they can avoid their parents is lying to themselves.

			<p>Look, I&rsquo;m LEFT-HANDED, which would be a pretty solid indication that I am right-brained.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t act like the people Wright describes. I have been in University-level art classes in which more than half the people were left-handed, and they did not act like that, or an adult version of that. I don&rsquo;t recall any Caucasian lefties of my childhood going berserk, either.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t know any Lefties that act, or acted, like that. I have known a FEW right-handed people who acted like that, when they were kids.</p>
<p>My first intuition is that what Wright is describing is a condition of having too much TESTOSTERONE, not only in Black males but in Black females. I think this has been pretty well established as fact.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the psychology of integration states that as one gets older, he becomes more in tune with the other half of his brain and with the lesser psychological functions of his personality. </p>
<p>This should be happening among Blacks, but the whooping pandemonium at Wright&rsquo;s church indicates that it largely has not.<br>
I know that Wright was largely talking about children, but the people I saw at Wright&rsquo;s church were ADULTS, whooping, jerking, shouting above the speaker.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with being &#8220;right-brained.&#8221;<br>

			<p>In his Press club performance before a mostly black audience, Reverend Wright energetically displayed almost every conclusion of his personal mis-education - slow-fried in black racism.</p>
<p>One of his conclusions is that black student&rsquo;s brains can only learn creatively, not objectively - so that instead of staying at their desks and listening, they need to be jumping around, perhaps practicing neighborhood tribal dances while chanting in ebonics.</p>
<p>For this, teachers are not needed, just keepers.    </p>

			<p>Essentially, what the Wrong Reverend Wright is saying is that blacks are less capable of abstract thought than people of other races.  Based on many centuries of empirical evidence it would appear that he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So just how do we accommodate those of African descent in our society?  I suppose we&rsquo;ll just have to adjust our (and their) expectations of what they can achieve and the rewards they can expect to reap.  </p>

<p>True, of course.  You are referring to genetics here, I assume&hellip;See the Blank Slate by Steve Pinker.  Identical twins, separated early in life, are discussed.  As adults, their political beliefs have correlation of 0.62&hellip;</p>

			<p><i>Mr. Hilliard argued that Western civilization was at once stolen from black Africa and crippling to black identity.</i></p>
<p>Ok, here&rsquo;s a question to which I&rsquo;ve never received an adequate response: if blacks founded civilization, how come they are completely unable to maintain one, anywhere on this earth or under any conditions, to this very day?</p>
<p>On the bright side though; if I take the Reverend&rsquo;s meaning correctly, he seems to advocate separating black and white students so as to allow each to &#8220;learn&#8221; (I use the term loosely) in the way which works best for them. We used to call this &#8220;segregation&#8221; back before it became a dirty word. </p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, this idea is also supported by many here at AmRen, most certainly to include myself. The Reverend may be an imbecile, a jerk and an A-1 nutjob, but maybe we can talk business with him after all. </p>

			<p>Wright&rsquo;s musings are of the sort of pseudo-scientific pondering that might have intrigued me when I was fourteen years old. The left-brain/right-brain argument has been used to &#8220;explain&#8221; the behavior of everything from southpaws to autistics to Japanese businessmen.</p>
<p>His meanderings in front of the NAACP made me stop to think a grand total of ONCE, when he talked about the use of diatonic vs. pentonic scales in music. I&rsquo;d never thought about it before, but then&hellip; it isn&rsquo;t that profound a thought. The rest of his insights are the sorts of things that are covered and debunked in the average freshman-level linguistics or psychology course. </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that educated people can adjust to  &mdash;  and move back and forth between  &mdash;  different perceptual styles, musical scales, and interpretations of reality. Learning to do so is part of becoming educated.</p>
<p>But I guess we can&rsquo;t really expect many black people to grasp THAT particular concept&hellip;</p>

<p>  That is what I have been thinking for a long time. That is only solution for the black problem. By bringing them to civilization, Whites have unwittingly opened a Pandora&rsquo;s Box. All those colonial idiots and Christian missionaries who thought that raising the black mans state to civilization was the White man&rsquo;s burden. Sigh, what a failure, what a waste of time and resources and what a waste of precious White lives! What results do we have to show!</p>
<p>The truth is blacks have an inferiority complex primarily with regards to Whites and to a smaller extent to Asians, Hispanics, even Ethiopians! <a href="http://stuffblackpeoplehate.com/2008/04/30/ethiopians/" rel="nofollow">http://stuffblackpeoplehate.com/2008/04/30/ethiopians/</a><br>
Besides, blacks are a very jealous race. Both these characteristics combined together leads to explosive hate. The only way this can be corrected is in ignorance. Ignorance of the civilized world beyond their tribal boundaries.  Yes you guessed it, they must be somehow returned to their pre-European contact tribal ways in Africa. No contact should be allowed between them and other races especially Europeans. Just the looks of the much much more attractive White race is enough to make them mad with jealousy. </p>
<p>Yet I see Christian churches today busy in their mission in Africa. I see herds of White boobs at places like Live Aid Africa. If even if a tenth of that money were spent on poor White kids in places like South Africa, Ukraine or any damn place. I see these same boobs go to Africa for charity. I see stupid White folks adopt black children. I see White nations sending food aid by taxing its own people causing them to have fewer children so that more White hating blacks can be born.</p>

			<p>Please watch both speeches. The first at the NAACP in Detroit, the second at the National Press Club.</p>
<p>Note the change in rhetoric.<br>
Syntax,<br>
structure.<br>
He is saying the same thing, first to blacks, then to whites.<br>
Each in their prospective languages.<br>
Are some of his arguments based on logical fallacies? Sure they are. Is he leaving out some things? Sure he is. Is he glossing over some ugly realities on both sides? You bet.</p>
<p>But after all is said and done, it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve ever seen such truly politically incorrect views aired in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>This is a good thing.</p>
<p>Remember, left to their own devices blacks would be reduced to subsistence level herders and hunter-gatherers with less than bronze age technology.<br>
The only reason that they are a threat is due to the actions of some of our own. The leaders who think that all people below the elite are nothing more than an amorphous mass of ne&rsquo;er-do-well genetic misfits, irregardless of skin color.</p>
<p>Note how the mainstream excoriates Jeremiah Wright.<br>
Was it any different for William Pierce?<br>
How about Jared Taylor?<br>
Yes you will say, quite a bit of difference.<br>
After all, Jeremiah Wright isn&rsquo;t being shouted down by leftist thugs. Doesn&rsquo;t need police protection. Doesn&rsquo;t risk the loss of livelihood or reputation. Or perhaps life.<br>
And you are right. There is a difference. But the message that blacks and whites are fundamentally different IS getting airplay.</p>
<p>And in the end, isn&rsquo;t that the point we have been trying to make for the last thirty years or so?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t reject a cure just because you didn&rsquo;t think of it. </p>

			<p><i>&#8220;Blacks, by contrast, cannot sit still in class or learn from quiet study, and they have difficulty learning from &ldquo;objects&rdquo; &mdash; books, for example &mdash; but instead learn from &ldquo;subjects,&rdquo; such as rap lyrics on the radio. These differences are neurological, according to Ms. Hale and Mr. Wright&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>When he was of school age, in Philadelphia, his white teachers &ldquo;freaked out because the black children did not stay in their place, over there, behind the desk.&rdquo;  Instead, the students &ldquo;climbed up all over [the teachers], because they learned from a &lsquo;subject,&rsquo; not an &lsquo;object.&rsquo;  &hellip;  [He] argued that disrupting the classroom through &ldquo;impulsive interrupting and loud talking&rdquo; is inherently black. </i></p>
<p>Well, so that explains it!  It&rsquo;s all neurological. Now  we understand. Having managed a large agency of them, I can tell you that <b>they can&rsquo;t sit still or keep quiet in the workplace either.</b> Nor do they have the slightest regard for following rules or instructions.  They just do whatever they please, regardless.   Any criticim is perceived as &#8220;racism&#8221;. Discipline becomes virtually  impossible and is done at the supervisor&rsquo;s own risk. They knew that upper management, worried for their own careers,  would  cringe and defend them.</p>
<p>Now we have an explanation:  they are congenitally incapable of behaving.  Thanks, Mr. Wright!  That explains it.  It also explains why they insist on bringing their radios and tapes to work. Even TV&rsquo;s.   [Yes, I&rsquo;m not kidding.]  We&rsquo;d have gospel music going on over here, and rap going over there, and half a dozen other programs playing all at once, Sheer cacophony. Any request to (merely) turn down their radio  (not off) would bring the reply (with the implied hint of an impending EEO complaint): <b> &#8220;Oh? You don&rsquo;t like our <i>GOSPEL  <i>music?&#8221;   </i></i></b>This carries the hint of <i>religous </i> discrimination as well. Most managers wouldn&rsquo;t touch it. And your own superiors didn&rsquo;t want even to hear about it. They dreaded anything like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I have said before that only blacks should supervise blacks. Indeed, only blacks should work with other blacks. They should have theirs, and we should have ours; then everybody could be happy and there would be no complaints of &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If is NOT that Blacks can&rsquo;t learn from books, it&rsquo;s that THEY DO NOT WANT TO LEARN! How many successful Blacks does it take, to refuse that insane theory?&#8221;<br>

They have no CAUSE to learn. Not so long as they are  given special treatment by employers, coddled by government, and cushioned by welfare.</p>
<p>Whether in the schools or on the job, they know that nothing can happen to them because&hellip;<br>
   &ldquo;the  (spineless) white elite&rsquo;s desire to avoid charges of racism cancels out all reasonable reactions to dangerous nonsense when such nonsense comes out of black mouths.&rdquo; </p>

			<p> &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t it odd that if I were to say that blacks are impulsive, loud, and incapable of learning by reading books I&rsquo;d be denounced as an evil white supremacist; but when Jeremiah Wright says the same thing he&rsquo;s a pro-black Afro-centrist?&#8221;<br>

Right!   And the biggest joke on that flaming octroon is that he&rsquo;s not even  &#8220;black&#8221;.<br>
(But, like most of them,  he&rsquo;s sure trying.)</p>

			<p>I am very disappointed that Mr. Obama was not &#8220;vetted&#8221; as they call for many months.  The media deceptors and Bolsheviks manipulated our Democracy and hijacked the election from the people.  Mr. Obama could never have even won his primary if the masses had known how nutty he could be with all his connections to nuts, terrorist, Mugabe want-to-be&rsquo;s, etc.</p>

			<p>Having said what I did in a previous post, I must add that I do not necessarily disagree with some of the things Wright has said.</p>
<p>America is not holy  &mdash;  the bombings of Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki were, to me, deplorable. We are talking about CIVILIANS here!  Dresden, especially, seems to have been the plan of a hate-crazed maniac, and I hope he gets exactly what he deserves, according to divine justice. But I deplore Hiroshima and Nagasaki, also. I know  &mdash;  it ended the war sooner, they say. </p>
<p>Did it really? Was there not another way?</p>
<p>What I do object to about Wright is his lack of scholarship and the way the Left adores him. I do not object to his championing of Blackness. I applaud it, as long as he preaches respect for other races. Just don&rsquo;t give me that nonsense that Beethoven was Black.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I applaud those who champion Whiteness, which is why I post here. </p>
<p>The hour is very late. We will get nowhere fast if we do not admit our mistakes (such as the Civil War, WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam and Iraq  &mdash;  how many lost? What potential gone forever? And for what? FOR WHAT?)    </p>

			<p>Louis From Montreal: Scott Phelps was a teacher in Pasadena, California.  Pasadena is noteworthy for the high proportion of its kids who attend private schools, largely Catholic.  They even have Jews and Moslems in Catholic schools there.  In the education business, it&rsquo;s known as the &#8220;Pasadena model&#8221;, public schools for the Blacks and Browns, private schools for the middle class.</p>

			<p>My wife says there was no other good way to end the Pacific War, other than the atomic bombings.  In 1945, the Japanese government was telling normal families that they should eat mice and cockroaches. Any US governmet that tried that would be immediately replaed.  The bombings gave the military junta the excuse to surrender, without taking more women and kids with them.</p>

			<p>Charles Murray and Rev. Jeremiah Wright share the same views but the latter has packaged it in a seemingly innocuous and indeed virtuous form wrapped up in black liberation theology. The media did not really push this story except for AC360 on CNN. In this report I saw Janice Hale a black women describing black children as monkeys that can&rsquo;t sit still. I bet my bottom dollar that the media would be all over this story had this non-sense been spouted by a suspected conservative. </p>
<p>The Rev. Wright and the rest of the  leftist intelligentsia who claim to speak on behalf of black people are like Janice Rogers brown said in the spirit of Pascal the knowing &ldquo;too much to be ignorant and to little to be wise.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>&ldquo;In the heyday of liberal democracy, all roads lead to slavery. And we no longer find slavery abhorrent. We embrace it. We demand more.&rdquo;    &mdash;   Judge Janice Rogers Brown.</p>

Interesting. I didn&rsquo;t know.  That is what the Parisians were doing during the siege of Paris in the Franco-Prussian war, just a little more than a hundred years ago.  Rats, cats, dogs and pigeons disappeared too   &mdash;   along with all the animals in the zoo, everything that could be eaten.</p>
<p><br>
<i>Rats, dogs, cats, and horses were regular fare on restaurant menus. <br>
A Latin Quarter menu contemporary with the siege reads in part:    <br>
   * Consommé de Cheval au millet.<br>
   * Brochettes de foie de Chien à la maître d&rsquo;hôtel.<br>
   * Emincé de rable de Chat. Sauce mayonnaise.<br>
   * Epaules et filets de Chien braisés. Sauce aux tomates.<br>
   * Civet de Chat aux Champignons.<br>
   * Côtelettes de Chien aux petits pois.<br>
   * Salmis de Rats. Sauce Robert.<br>
   * Gigots de chien, flanqués de ratons. Sauce poivrade.<br>
   * Begonias au jus.<br>
   * Plum-pudding au rhum et à la Moelle de Cheval.</i><br>

			<p>Wright is a self proliferating enigma.<br>
Sadly! Instead of pointing out how people should react to all discriminatory practices &amp; Bias. He leads by bringing the same Old gibberish. Does right believe whites haven&rsquo;t been used in Illegal Government experiments? They have!<br>
America needs to climb off this pedastal building of Race this and That. Especially politically.<br>
People need to realise We all come from our own heritages and cultures. And we have a right to live those heritages and cultures without Government telling Us How.But You better be here LEGALLY!<br>
But this Gives No 1 certain group special privilegdes or recognition by Law even,  in the common arena we called our Nation,  America!<br>
WE are ALL special in our RIGHTS! (That are all being taken away)<br>
And if we donot All see that soon. We&rsquo;re All in trouble!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been lied to.And the squimish Politicians and corporates are using us again to drive home some kind of division. To make they&rsquo;re New Communist Order.( The Wealthy Brits are in on IT)<br>
So they can walk all over Us, as they distract Us from important matters. Like the self preservation of this Great country.</p>
<p>White, Black, Hispanic, Jaopanese, Chinese american. They don&rsquo;t care. They want to conquer Us and ruin this nation for self &amp; Greed. <br>
And there will even be Some Americans(Loyal only to the British common wealth)(Remember the Tory Red coats?) who will Kill Americans,  to help them.<br>
Wake UP! Time is short!</p>
