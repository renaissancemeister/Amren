						<p>Republican U.S. presidential candidate John McCain accused North Carolina&rsquo;s Republican Party of being &#8220;out of touch with reality&#8221; over its refusal to pull an advertisement criticizing Democrat Barack Obama.</p>
<p>In an NBC interview aired on Friday, the Arizona senator said he has done all he can to persuade the state party to cancel the television ad that criticizes Obama as &#8220;too extreme&#8221; because of controversial remarks made by his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>North Carolina is one of two states holding the next crucial Democratic primaries on May 6 in the tight race between Obama and New York Sen. Hillary Clinton to oppose McCain in the November presidential election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The McCain campaign said it had been assured that North Carolina Republicans would withdraw the TV ad, scheduled to air early next week.</p>
<p>But the state party served notice that the ad would air. On Friday, a YouTube.com version appeared on the party&rsquo;s Web site at www.ncgop.org with an invitation for visitors to contribute money.</p>
<blockquote>
<i>[Editor&rsquo;s Note: The North Carolina Republican Party ad can be viewed <b>here.</b>]</i>

			<p>John &#8220;Maverick&#8221; McCain, always with one eye watching the Washington press corp, always alert for their expressions of approval, flips the bone to loyal Republicans once again.  </p>
<p>This most recent expression of contempt for Republican loyalists may just prove to the proverbial one straw too many.  I hear increasing numbers of people saying McCain would be no better than either Hillary or Obama, except that the results of a McCain presidency would be blamed on the Republicans.  Certainly, whatever his intentions, if the Democrats achieve a veto-proof majority in the Senate, McCain&rsquo;s sole function will as blamee for the results of their actions.  </p>
<p>Maybe we need another four Carter years, for at least cause and effect will be more clearly identifiable.  Rush Limbaugh should <br>
extend Operation Chaos through the election and advise his listeners to vote for the Democrat.</p>

			<p>Mc Cain is a fool thinking taking the high road will lessen the nastiness of the upcoming presidential campaign.  Once the Democrats select their nominee they will attack McCain over anything, real or imagined, they can think of.</p>

			<p>Looks like mccain is doing everything he can to prove to LEGITIMATE conservatives that he is a republican in name only. Perhaps if he continues with his kinder gentler approach towards dems, they will invite him to the whitehouse for obama&rsquo;s inaguration Party. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;Republican U.S. presidential candidate John McCain accused North Carolina&rsquo;s Republican Party of being &lsquo;out of touch with reality&rsquo; over its refusal to pull an advertisement criticizing Democrat Barack Obama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well here we go, Senator No Brains McCain strikes again!</p>
<p>And for that matter so has the Republican primary electorate nationwide; how stupid not to realize that like Bob Dole in 1992, if you were to give the party an enema today, the nozzle would be stuck in McCain&rsquo;s head!</p>
<p>I warned another poster here that I communicate with regularly offline, to expect this kind of weasel-like behavior from this wretched old fool. This ad reflects the basic strategy that he and his handlers should be embracing; it paints Comrade Obama as the radical anti-white and un-American Mau Mau, that he really is. It pulls no punches, and that is exactly how you win an election against a charlatan media darling. It is certainly not done by mollycoddling him, in the same manner as his simpering and weepy eyed fawning imps in the media do. </p>
<p>I am honestly sick to my stomach over this election. Just when you think things can&rsquo;t get worse, they become abysmal. Was it not bad enough that we have suffered under the &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; of that Chimp-in-Chief for the last 8 years, and General Secretary Willy Wizard before him? Now we are reduced to choosing between: Medusa the Red Queen, Mandingo Caf√© Au Lait, and Johnny Weaselseed.</p>

			<p>Earth to McCain- - Earth to McCain!!!! If McCain hopes to win the White House, he better get a backbone. HE&rsquo;S the one out of touch with reality and if he does&rsquo;nt come out of his P/C coma soon, Obama will eat him alive! Not once did he denounce negative ads about his Republican competition during the primaries. But let someone put a TRUTHFUL ad out about that snake Obama, and here comes McCain out of breath and sweating up to the microphone to denounce it! Go figure!!!!</p>

			<p>The current crop of presidential contenders reminds me of a humorous poster that I saw several years ago, tacked on the door of a cynical college student:  &#8220;We stand at a crossroads:  One road leads to desolation and despair.  The other road leads to heartbreak and total loss.  May God grant that we choose wisely.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Sit this election out. As president, McCain will lead the Republican party and House. At least now they are somewhat conservative but that will not survive his unprincipled centrist leadership. </p>

			<p> McCain is carrying the &#8220;parfit gentil knight&#8221; routine too far. I don&rsquo;t question his sincerity, but all is fair in politics, just as it is in love and war. He should realize that. If an ad helps your chances, or hurts your opponent&rsquo;s chances, and is factual and not vulgar or patently offensive, then use it. As Mr. Dooley once said, &#8220;Politics ain&rsquo;t beanbag!&#8221;</p>
<p> I suspect that John McCain is overcompensating because Obama is black; I doubt if he would have protested so strenuously if his opponent who was being attacked was White.</p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t figure out if this guy is just a blabbering idiot or it&rsquo;s smooth campaign management.  Is it an attempt to appear as the innocent good guy caught between two mudslinging Democratic candidates and make him more appealing to the masses?  Since it&rsquo;s up in the air as to who will be the Democratic nominee, he really has no reason to get involved at this point. I&rsquo;m a conservative and I despise McCain but I know if push comes to shove and Obama is the nominee, I have no choice but to vote for McCain.  I&rsquo;m actually hoping for a Clinton victory in the primaries so I can stay home on Election Day.      </p>

			<p>McCain is virtually indistinguishable from Obama. They both receive their tuition and paychecks from the same &#8220;open borders&#8221; corporate masters. His job is to safeguard the power of his masters, not to win the election. </p>

<p>Reverend Wright is a legitimate issue given the central role he plays in Empty Suit Obama&rsquo;s life, by Empty Suit&rsquo;s own words. </p>
<p>One thing that is thoroughly Republican about McCain is that he wants the approval and admiration of his enemies.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s been understood for many years now, but the Republican Party is officially no longer the de facto party of Whites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, my friends, but I could never vote for John McCain, even if it means Obama will win the White House. He is the White equivalent of an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221;.</p>
<p>This will all end very badly someday, as history teaches us.<br>

I am a bit disappointed at the shallowness of most of the comments above. </p>
<p>The current situation is that Obama is a seriously weakened candidate who McCain will be able to beat. That is the good news that emerged when Hillary won Pennsylvania, even after it was clear that she can&rsquo;t get the nomination. If the Democrats aren&rsquo;t rallying around Obama now, it shows that he won&rsquo;t win in November.</p>
<p>And so, if McCain wants to pretend that he is above negative campaigning, it is a very small deal. He is going to behave in a &#8220;presidential&#8221; manner to give himself some dignity, as befitting someone his age. For him to endorse that (frankly) tacky add would diminish his stature.</p>

			<p>McCain is wrong.  Wright is a legitimate issue; Obama went to his goofy church for 20 years and titled his vanity book after an awkward phrase uttered by Wright.  If I hang out with creeps for two decades and name my book after stuff they say, it&rsquo;s legitimate to question whether I, too, am a creep.  <br>
McCain isn&rsquo;t a fighter anymore.  Hillary, on the other hand, is a fighter.</p>

			<p>In some ways I think that John McCain is still a conservative.<br>
He seems to be trying to uphold the unique white ideal of common law which defines moral behavior as dependent on ones&rsquo; actions, or values if you wish, as opposed to ones&rsquo; identity.</p>
<p>White people, and only white people, embrace the idea of common law. </p>
<p>So John McCain is still one of us. His problem is that he thinks that all people in this country, and the world generally, once exposed to western thought, will embrace it emphatically. This is the standard worldview of Anglo-Saxon elites for the last 200 years. At least.</p>
<p>The common law ideal is foreign to Barack Obama.<br>
The common law ideal isn&rsquo;t foreign to Hillary Clinton.But she has rejected it for political expediency.</p>
<p>And yes, Ron Paul is a great guy. After all, Marchin&rsquo; Lootin&rsquo; King is one of his heroes.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t vote for this fool.  Anyone who comes in LAST in his class has no business in the White House.  He is completely unprincipled and would be just as happy in the Democrat party.  If Insane McCain is elected, you&rsquo;ll see erstwhile conservative senators and congressmen being forced to follow his liberal lead on issues they would normally oppose.  This will be the end of conservatism in the Republican party and the only other choice will be to form another party.  Better to let a Democrat in the White House and wait and see what&rsquo;s available in four years.  McCain is simply more of the Bush nonsense that has led us where we are today. Hold your nose and vote for the Dems this time around!</p>

So true. The Mau Mau did consist of Kenyans although it was the Kikuyu and not the Luo of which Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;father&#8221; is a member.<br>
Mc Cain is our lesser of two evil choice. That always seems to be the case any more.</p>

			<p>He has no problem slamming republicans, ala Romney, Huckabee, etc.,nor did he have a problem on Bill the bomber, only blacks. He seems a bit off the bubble, possibly due to being a POW. That is not a slur,but it is unimaginable,that he is not mentally damaged from his ordeal. My greatest admiration to him for what he went through, however despite his severe shortcomings I still consider him to be less a loser than the competition. Woe is us!!  </p>

			<p>Since when does this country celebrate prisoners of war as heroes? By what right does anyone defer to John McCain any judgement or discretion regarding military matters? What makes anyone believe John McCain might properly lead this country as president or commander in chief?</p>
<p>1928 was the last election when no incumbent from either political party campaigned for president. Now we are 80 years later with the same thing.</p>
<p>1952 was the last election when no incumbent from either party will be on the general ballot in November. Read up on that election. It is uncanny how many parallels you can find with this election year. (Just switch the parties.)</p>
<p>In 1952, it was the Republican Party that had a pair of candidates that ran a close race to the convention, with no clear winner, and with neither candidate able to secure the nomination. (Eisenhower and Taft) Eisenhower stole the nomination by unseating a good many Taft delegates from Southern states, claiming they had been switched. Ike was nominated on the first ballot.</p>
<p>In 1952, it was the Democratic Party that had an apparent front runner expecting the nomination at the convention, ahead of all others in delegates. (Kefauver) Stevenson was not even a candidate and refused to be a candidate until the convention. He got the nomination on the third ballot, after some shagging by (then president) Truman.</p>
<p>What is important to point out about 1952 is the outcomes. Eisenhower and Taft fought hard and dirty for the nomination, some said they split the Republican Party. In the end, it elected the first Republican president since 1928. More specifically, Obama and Clinton are doing the same thing and it will not defeat the party in November. (I promise.)</p>
<p>By contrast, Kefauver went to the Republican convention in 1952 with the most delegates (like McCain) but ended up not getting the nomination. Hopefully this happens to McCain too. (Hope burns eternal. Otherwise, we are deep doo.)</p>

			<p>John McCain has long been my least favorite Republican politician. If he was running against anyone else besides Obama I would sit out or vote for a 3rd party in protest. But I am so horrified by Obama and the company that he keeps that I have no choice but to vote for McCain.</p>

			<p>All the MSM spin, all the Money in the World, all the condemnation and shame of the Power Elite directed at anyone who refuses to blindly obey, all of that and more, will do nothing to keep the Office of the President of the United States from fading into the background of ineffectual figure head. Hell, it&rsquo;s already there. What do you think the Bush Presidency is all about. Does ANYONE think he&rsquo;s calling the shots?</p>

			<p>Any real conservative that makes the choice to hold his nose and pull the lever for Juan McCain is going to deeply regret that action for a long, long, time.  Unlike Bush, who&rsquo;s liberalism and true persona was hidden by his claim of &#8220;compassionate conservatism&#8221;, we know exactly where McCain is coming from.  He&rsquo;s been falling all over himself reaching out to the libs for as long as I can remember.  The guy is a total embarrassment to us, and this is only the beginning if he happens to win the election. </p>

			<p>I said for months that Romney was the man for the job, but some people couldn&rsquo;t get past the Mormon thing, which is just silly.  Now we&rsquo;re stuck with McCain.</p>
<p>He is such a fool.  As a religious woman, I can tell you that church-goers choose their churches based on the extent to which the pastor&rsquo;s point of view reflects their own.  Michelle&rsquo;s comments about being proud of her country for the first time in her life and her statement that America is a &#8220;mean country&#8221; only confirm my view that they hate everything about this country and will immediately set out to change everything they can.  Obviously, their attitude toward the status quo is highly relevant to the issues.</p>

to millions Obama seems nothing but an empty suit and media hype&hellip;but the fact that he went to Wrights church for 20 years listening to &#8220;AIDS was caused by US Govt to persecute blacks&#8221;<br>

			<p>Let the Republican Party know that they can&rsquo;t continue to take conservatives for granted.  Conservatives sticking with the Republican Party are like an abused woman sticks with a husband who berates and beats her.  We keep getting candidates like Bush and McCain who refuse to stop the immigration problem and do nothing to support the rights of white conservatives.   Pray for a new party like the British National Party.  Grow a spine conservatives and stay home in November.  We just need to sit out in large numbers for ONE election to let the Republicans see that without us they are nothing.</p>

			<p>I was about to kill myself over this latest McCain act of dhimmitude when a friend insisted I consider this angle:  </p>
<p>Remember when Huckabee made a big deal of calling a press conference on a stage with a huge screen TV showcasing a fellow Republican&rsquo;s ad, ostensibly for the purpose of denouncing the ad as some egregiously unacceptable way to negatively attack one&rsquo;s opponent?</p>
<p>Nobody  &mdash;  I mean NOBODY was fooled into thinking that it was anything other than a poorly veiled, cynical tactic by Huck-a-buck as a way to make sure that the attack ad itself was seen, studied, analyzed, and evaluated over and over again by millions upon millions of cable viewers that might otherwise never be exposed to it at all!</p>
<p>In Huckabee&rsquo;s case, the stunt was mocked as a lame sham, a bald-faced piece of P.R.; would-be subterfuge disguised as righteous, high-road indignation over purportedly undesirable campaigning by one&rsquo;s fellow Republican.</p>
<p>Here, however, with the McCain/N.C. GOP case, it is perhaps fathomable that Ol&rsquo; High Road himself just might be cagier than we&rsquo;re giving him credit for&hellip;it&rsquo;s tough to see it this way (especially given his caterwauling against waterboarding, etc.), but we just may have a live one here, a real jungle fighter and combat pilot whose stealth is matched only by his authentic battle scars.</p>
<p>By doing the same thing Huckabee was doing  &mdash;  publicly objecting to an ad in order to explode its exposure and influence  &mdash;  only doing in a much more Machiavellian AND credible way (in terms of his known character) McCain could just be the sneaky old Sun Tzu that we need in these times.  So sneaky even we, his alleged legion, can&rsquo;t readily see the strategy.</p>
<p>Ya think??  I about jumped for joy at the prospect my friend presented.  I&rsquo;m still skeptical, but enough of you chime in that it&rsquo;s possible and/or likely, I&rsquo;ll feel much better about soldiering on.  </p>
<p>McCain is either an utter disaster, or a diabolically brilliant deliverer of the White House to the GOP.  I distrust him for reasons galore, but in terms of military creds as C-in-C there is no other option. </p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s crazy like a fox, so crazy it drives US crazy, we may not be in such trouble after all.     </p>

			<p>John McCain is given a free pass because of his military service, Obama for being black, and Her Highness for being a woman.  Friday McCain was in Little Rock and had a private meeting with 50 black students who wanted to express their concerns.  I think McCain is still suffering from ptsd, understandably.<br>

<p>Good post.  Everyone should read it. Of course, I would love to believe it.  His behavior might be of the Trojan Horse variety in this case, who knows.  Stanger things have happened in Politics.  But for me the bottom line is this - get a white man in the White House.  If we can&rsquo;t, hold tight and don&rsquo;t flinch, cause the cat will be out of the bag and public discourse will change forever in America.  It already has in so many ways, just in the past 5 years.  It will even more in the next two or three. In fact, the truth will out no matter who&rsquo;s in the White house.</p>
<p>Dedalus said it best a while back when he said the focus should be kept on exactly what sets the West apart from the rest of the World - Spiritual Growth, and how it expresses itself, ie; a movement toward Freedom and the Sovereign Individual. </p>
<p>AR has a great article somewhere in its archives about Political alliances and how to form them and who with.  That is going to happen more and more. What better way to practice the principles of Free Speech than by making the effort to talk and listen to each other.</p>

			<p>After some thought, I&rsquo;ve changed my opinion on this. Just go into google and click News, then Elections. This issue is plastered all over the news, on a national scale. Whether McCain meant what he said or not, the result is brilliant politics. If McCain had just not said anything, the commercial would have just been another local election ad, with no national exposure. Now its national news, and best of all, its FREE. Great for someone that&rsquo;s on a shoestring budget.</p>
<p>Now, an issue of concern to every thinking voter is whether or not McCain really meant it. That particular truth will never be know to anyone but McCain and his insiders. And, does it really make a difference? That&rsquo;s  personal politics, and every voter will have their own opinion. For what its worth, I think McCain or Hillary would be better than Obama. Obama&rsquo;s goals and loyalties have very little intersection with mine.</p>

is undermining the entire psyche of the nation. If you think that the likes of Newt Gingrich with his ideological hysteria is an admirable, or better yet <br>
even an emotionally normal human being&hellip;read no further. Its that attitude of which prefers a Newt or a Bush to a normally functioning human like McCain that is fueling the candidacy of Obama and Hillary. If you think that the country would be better off in the hands of Obama than John McCain you have serious reality issues, and you probably wont recognize the national apocalypse the Far Left has in store for this nation till it engulfs you.</p>

<p>McCain could make short work of Obama with this. I can come to no other conclusion that this election is being thrown by the Republicans, just like the one in &#8216;96. </p>

He looks good to independents and gets elected.  This reminds me of the Gang of 12 (or whatever it was called).  People said he was a traitor but in the end, conservatives got almost all the judges they wanted.  His strategy worked.  Keep your focus, we can&rsquo;t have Obama or Clinton for 4 years.</p>

			<p>The only reason McCain is the potential nominee is because of low Republican voter turnout and many Democrats switching registration to ensure the worst possible candidate for us.  Was that such a brilliant strategy for Republicans to change sides and vote for Obama to beat Hillary out?  Now they&rsquo;re crossing lines again to make sure Clinton keeps up with him so the superdelegates will decide the race.  I admit it&rsquo;s entertaining to watch this fiasco but we ignored our own side in the process and look how it&rsquo;s cost us.    </p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t McCain know that this is war? Who cares what anyone thinks about a TV ad against an opponent. No one can deny what Wright said. I don&rsquo;t care if his words were &#8216;taken out of context&rsquo; or spliced from different sermons. Those were his words. </p>
<p>Ron Paul has never had a chance to be the Republican nominee. Even if I agreed with him the most, I wouldn&rsquo;t have voted for him. He just seemed like an airhead to me. He reminded me of Perot. I play the game just like the candidates do. I don&rsquo;t waste my vote. I voted for Romney for his views on the war and his economic know-how. He or McCain were the only two choices.</p>
<p>Before the Rev. Wright debacle, I thought Obama might not be worse than McCain. I think it would be better if McCain goes up  against Hillary. Then all of the Republicans that jumped the fence to vote for Obama would come back to the Republican side. </p>
<p>The press can&rsquo;t find any bad truth to report about McCain. They tried to make something out of the lobbyist. They checked into his finances. He contributed plenty of his money to charity. He&rsquo;s too liberal, but he&rsquo;s solid in that no one&rsquo;s going to unearth anything damaging from his past. </p>

I believe most Amren enthusiasts are conservatives.  So Amren people have no choice - McCain is closest to their beliefs so they have to vote from him.  The choice isn&rsquo;t DeMint or Hillery/Obama or McCain. The choice is McCain or Hillery/Obama.  To not vote for McCain is to cut off yur noise to spite your face.  I am voting for McCain&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had this same thought. If it&rsquo;s true then their decision would be in the same category as Mass Immigration. Multi-culturalism is about a total surrender to sentimentality for those in the Power Elite who live in gated communities; but, it&rsquo;s also an opportunity for them to act like Immortals who kill mere Mortals for sport.  </p>
<p>Anyway, Mass Immigration, Obama Presidency, Political Correctness, War in Iraq, soon to be War in Iran, Housing Crisis, Failing Economy, Distintigrating Social fabric, Crumbling Educational System, Over-crowded Jails, Over-crowded Hospitals, Over-crowded Country, EX-Country&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, they all go together.</p>
<p>Now, the good news.  Obama is a slick nobody in a suit.  Any good qualities, spiritual or intellectual, that he may have had in the form of personal potential he lost long ago when he sold-out to the spiritually bankrupt and intellectually vapid, non-stop, shakedown scam of Identity Politics.  Two basic things among many will happen. ALL the world will get a front row seat to incompetence and codependence of this crowd. </p>

<p>Screw him. I hope he loses. Obama, Clinton, McCain - all will be bad for the country, but only the acts of one will get blamed on the GOP. At least with the other two we can regroup and regain control of Congress in 2 years.</p>
<p>The other advantage to an Obama presidency is that all of America would learn what white Southerners already know - how very corrupt, conceited, leftist, and race-obsessed black politicians truly are.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m at a loss as to who I&rsquo;ll vote for.  If I vote for McCain, I tend to believe us conservatives will continue to be ignored or even demonized.  When Linda Chavez attacked us and called us racists for wanting the border enforced, Bush stood by and said nothing. He should have been pressured to ask for her resignation and if he refused, support the Democrats in his impeachment.  Let&rsquo;s not forget about Ken Mehlman and his apology for the Southern Strategy against blacks.  Many people in his administration, including himself, have thumbed their nose at us.  Bush becomes a conservative only when it suits his goals, like those fake prayer breakfasts for illegal aliens.  Pray to God for our White wicked souls for not accepting these criminals in our communities, all the while providing cheap slave labor to his corporate cronies.  I have alot of trouble believing Bush is a devout Christian, considering all the unmarried closet homosexuals he&rsquo;s had in his cabinet, past and present.  McCain is nothing more than a more liberal Bush and we can expect more of the same treatment from him.  I absolutely pray that the Super Delegates turn on McCain and nominate someone more appealing to conservatives.</p>

			<p>When will McCain go ahead and endorse Obama for president? With this election looming like a choice between hanging or the firing squad, at the AR Conference in February, I asked Jared Taylor for his thoughts about what to do in November. As I took his response, he seemed to lean toward McCain as the lesser of the two disasters. One could certainly see his point. I just wonder how he feels now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, &ldquo;Jew Among You&rdquo; (should I say &ldquo;Jew Among Us&rdquo;?) also made a strong case to me that it might us well be President Obama serving up PC-multiculturalism&rsquo;s next great leap forward. I think you meant that then at least Republicans might stand and fight, instead of turning blind eyes and churning out excuses for a President McKennedy, as they&rsquo;ve done for el Presidente Boosh. Plus, four years of Obamania MIGHT finally shock whites into action ‚Äì if it&rsquo;s ever going to happen. For me, still, the prospect of rule by an extreme white-hating, leftist fraud (meaning Obama, to clarify that I don&rsquo;t mean the other leftist, McCain, not to mention &ldquo;Hillary&rdquo;) is just too terrifying to risk. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to put words in the mouths of either of you. I&rsquo;m doing my best to accurately regurgitate what I believe you said, in the hopes of stimulating discussion to generate ideas about this seemingly hopeless &ldquo;election.&rdquo; Honestly, I&rsquo;m waiting for God to intervene and save our country. So much could still change ‚Äì must change! ‚Äì between now and November.</p>
<p>Since their advance seems on its way, ponder what&rsquo;s next for the politically correct. For example, they&rsquo;ll surely want to add the blessings of diversity to remaining white pockets like, say, North Dakota or West Virginia. Confederate symbols, of course, will be forbidden even on Confederate graves in South Carolina. But won&rsquo;t the Shamrock, symbol of being Irish, or Christian crosses worn at work, and more, also come under fire? They&rsquo;re &ldquo;divisive.&rdquo; For sure, amnesty for illegal aliens is on the list, and they&rsquo;ll ban the very term &ldquo;illegal alien,&rdquo; along with any discrimination against them or the Spanish language. But won&rsquo;t they also want to legalize in advance the millions who pour in later, so they won&rsquo;t have to discuss this again? And how exactly will we pay our &ldquo;reparations&rdquo; for slavery? To ramp up the propaganda, no doubt they&rsquo;ll build a slavery museum on the Mall in Washington. FBI statistics that tell us who commits the most crimes will probably go away. They&rsquo;ll probably also want felons to vote, since so many are you-know-who. And what about affirmative action sentencing guidelines? Maybe voter registration will become automatic to dumb down the process more. Of course, the next AR conference might be almost impossible. </p>
<p>Sorry to be so down. I would just like to hear some guesses about the storm that&rsquo;s coming.<br>

			<p>McCain has to reject any racially charged campaign ad.  They all do.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean they are going to reject any votes they may get from those ads.  Blacks are voting for Obama at a 92% clip.  Of course that is race based.  Obama will never openly acknowledge that because it&rsquo;s too racially charged.  But he&rsquo;s happy to be getting those votes.</p>
<p>karl is right.  I&rsquo;m voting for McCain if not for anything except to keep Obama or Clinton out of the White House.  The democrat party symbol should be changed from the donkey to the trojan horse, because they represent a whole lot of interests that would like to see the US burned to the ground.  And the GOP could do a lot worse than McCain IMO.</p>

			<p>The current Republican Party is a travesty and Mccain is its leader.  Obama is an extreme leftist, totally out of touch with the country, whose entire life has revolved around himself, being a mulatto, his black racial identity.  I look forward to an Obama administration  &mdash;  one which will destroy the Democratic party for generations.  Far better that than, Bush III for 8 more years.  Sometimes things must get worse before they can imporve  &mdash;  Obama may well be the key to that development.</p>

  The problem is the Republican party will not learn. They keep choosing pretend conservatives like Bush and McCain who are actually liberals, when they are in office.  The white conservatives tried to teach the Republican party a lesson in 1992, by allowing Bill clinton to be elected, by refusing to reelect Bush 1, who also had a disdianful attitude towards the conservative beliefs.  It didn&rsquo;t do any good for us.  As Pat Buchnan said the Republican party is the stupid party and that&rsquo;s why people don&rsquo;t want to help them get into power. They take us for granted and don&rsquo;t feel they have to earn our vote.  I think I&rsquo;ll vote for Ron Paul or Bob Barr this time.</p>

			<p>I know Republicans in Wisconsin who voted for Hillary.  I wish we could all just worry about our own party.  Sure that Dems did the same thing.  What concerns me now is that time has revealed aspects of Obama that were not transparent when he was gaining so much momentum.  There are too many components that play into this election that may hurt our chances to choose the best person.  Is anyone aware of the fact that the candidates were asked who was the head of state of one of the countries I can&rsquo;t remember, but the only one who knew the name was Hillary.  Hillary is by far the most intelligent, most informed, and I believe most dedicated.   Please consider all of our choices and choose based on who is best.</p>

<p>Karl, I have stood by that same, reasoned logic for years. I have repeatedly voted for Republicans for the very reason you cited. It always seemed logical for one to vote for the viable candidates that he best identifies with. Now, I question that logic. </p>
<p>McCain violates many Conservative core values to an extent that is deeply disturbing. Yes, Barack and Hillary would be worse, but to what degree? It may be better for traditional Conservatives to send a message to the Republicans.</p>
<p>I will not be voting for McCain, Hillary, or Obama, and I will not write in Ron Paul (because of his public comments about the race realist from Florida who donated money to his campaign).</p>

			<p>McCain doesn&rsquo;t care about conservative voters and thinks he can win by pandering to Democratic voters.  Look at Obama&rsquo;s dismal performance.  He hasn&rsquo;t won any of the big blue states except for his own, Illinois and garners only half of the vote from his party.  </p>

			<p>There is nothing more politically incorrect than being honest about both race and religion and McCain knows this. Since Wright is a combination of the two it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me one bit that he takes the politically correct path, after all he is a politician.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Since their advance seems on its way, ponder what&rsquo;s next for the politically correct. For example, they&rsquo;ll surely want to add the blessings of diversity to remaining white pockets like, say, North Dakota or West Virginia. Confederate symbols, of course, will be forbidden even on Confederate graves in South Carolina. But won&rsquo;t the Shamrock, symbol of being Irish, or Christian crosses worn at work, and more, also come under fire? They&rsquo;re &ldquo;divisive.&rdquo; For sure, amnesty for illegal aliens is on the list, and they&rsquo;ll ban the very term &ldquo;illegal alien,&rdquo; along with any discrimination against them or the Spanish language. But won&rsquo;t they also want to legalize in advance the millions who pour in later, so they won&rsquo;t have to discuss this again? And how exactly will we pay our &ldquo;reparations&rdquo; for slavery? To ramp up the propaganda, no doubt they&rsquo;ll build a slavery museum on the Mall in Washington. FBI statistics that tell us who commits the most crimes will probably go away. They&rsquo;ll probably also want felons to vote, since so many are you-know-who. And what about affirmative action sentencing guidelines? Maybe voter registration will become automatic to dumb down the process more. Of course, the next AR conference might be almost impossible.</p>
<p>Sorry to be so down. I would just like to hear some guesses about the storm that&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>Posted by Recovering Republican at 11:48 PM on April 26  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Yeah, all that is coming down the pike in increments.  </p>
<p>I think McCain will seek policies only slightly less liberal than Obama, and on the most important issue to me, immigration, he&rsquo;s at least as open borders as Obama.</p>
<p>Something has to really open comatose White&rsquo;s eyes to the horrible lie that is multiculturalism.  I don&rsquo;t think anything will do that more than the anti-white Obama.  He is likely to overreach on behalf of blacks on many issues.  He will champion quotas probably.<br>
These things might be just the catalyst to awaken whites and make them advocate for themselves as a group.</p>
<p>My biggest fear with an Obama presidency would be that he tries to implement soul killing hate speech laws, and tries to outlaw the very kinds of community that we find here on AmRen.  It could happen.  Already has in Britain.  The internet is the only place where one can rationally discuss race without being treated like a leper, in spite of the fact that the issues are fact based, but they are politically incorrect truths.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a horrible scenario we face this year, but McCain is even worse than Bush.  Obama will be worse still, but as a strategy to awaken whites, he might hasten that.</p>

<p>That from a POLITICIAN?  He&rsquo;s triangulating.  McCain admonishes &#8220;fellow&#8221; (as they refer to their slavering inferiors) Republicans and wins fair-and-balanced award with the swarthy Democrats, who might be willing to flip when it comes down to it.  Didn&rsquo;t the Clintons teach you anything?  (And they didn&rsquo;t invent it, either.)</p>
<p>The thing about McCain is, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to realize that quite a number of potential voters wrote him off immediately when he sent (and <a href="http://onix.gtcomm.net/~emporium/files/NPR_McCain_031708_1.mp3" rel="nofollow">continues to send!</a>) open love notes to the illegals, that he was on their side completely.  Of course this was yet another triangulation with the twinkle-toed, white, liberal Democrats, in a swoon about &#8220;social justice&#8221; for those down-trodden Mestizos just lookin&rsquo; for work.</p>
<p>A second thing he doesn&rsquo;t get, I think.  The number of voters in his Republican base who, even though they haven&rsquo;t cut him loose yet, are right on the damned edge of doing so!  So essentially he&rsquo;s trying to win with Democrat votes.  Why doesn&rsquo;t he just change parties??</p>

<p>Get a grip. mccain is no friend of conservatives and even though he was shouted down my most Americans over his amnesty stunt he is still pushing amnesty. The best strategy is for all conservatives to write in the same candidate&rsquo;s name. I say, Tancredo or Hunter. This will give the GOP the hint that we are all tired of the nonsense. Perhaps even open the door for a 3rd party to fill the obvious vaccum of true conservative representation. Voting for the leser of 2 evils only serves to validate the GOP movement to the left even more. Obama, I agree willbe a disaster. We can put up with HRC for 4 years and at the same time give the GOP a warning shot over the bow.</p>

<p>I also can&rsquo;t think of a better way to hasten Civil War Two while we still have demographics on our side.</p>
