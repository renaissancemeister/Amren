						<p>Almost two-thirds of people in Britain fear race relations are so poor tensions are likely to spill over into violence, a BBC poll has suggested. </p>
<p>Of the 1,000 people asked, 60% said the UK had too many immigrants and half wanted foreigners encouraged to leave. </p>
<p>But the proportion of people describing themselves as &ldquo;racially prejudiced&rdquo; was down to 20%, compared with 24% in 2005. </p>
<p>Equality and Human Rights Commission head Trevor Phillips said the findings were &ldquo;alarming&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s last serious race riots &mdash; when violent clashes erupted between white and Asian youths in northern England &mdash; happened seven years ago. </p>
<p>Despite this, the poll, carried out by Mori, found three out of four people thought there was now a great deal or a fair amount of tension between races and nationalities. </p>
<p>And almost two in three feared tension was certain or likely to lead to violence, although it is not clear whether people are imagining full-blown street riots or minor scuffles. </p>
<p>Mr Phillips told BBC News: &ldquo;What worries me is if that friction starts to catch fire &mdash; if people do genuinely believe it&rsquo;s going to catch fire then we&rsquo;re in trouble. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This finding may reflect not what is happening today but the story that&rsquo;s been told of the last 40 years &mdash; that if you get people of different kinds together then eventually there&rsquo;s going to be trouble.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The survey was commissioned to mark the 40th anniversary of Enoch Powell&rsquo;s infamous &ldquo;rivers of blood&rdquo; speech, in which he described the indigenous population&rsquo;s &ldquo;sense of alarm and resentment&rdquo; over immigration. </p>
<p>Speaking of his foreboding, he said: &ldquo;Like the Roman, I seem to see the river Tiber foaming with blood.&rdquo; </p>
<p>BBC home editor Mark Easton says Powell&rsquo;s words, spoken to a small gathering in Birmingham&rsquo;s Midland hotel, still echo down the decades. </p>
<p>He says the effect of Powell&rsquo;s speech was in fact to force the issue of immigration off the political agenda, with any politician who ventured to broach the subject risking being accused of playing the race card. </p>
<p>This situation still exists 40 years later, our correspondent says. </p>
<p>Five months ago, a Tory candidate in Birmingham, Nigel Hastilow, was forced to step down by David Cameron for saying Powell was right that uncontrolled immigration would change Britain irrevocably. </p>
<p>However, the BBC poll finds many people share that view. </p>
<p>Asked if they thought immigration meant their local area didn&rsquo;t feel like Britain any more, a quarter of the sample agreed &mdash; double the amount who felt this three years ago. </p>
<p>Six out of 10 said immigration had made parts of Britain feel like a foreign country. </p>
<p>When Tory leader Michael Howard suggested communities couldn&rsquo;t cope with the pace of immigration during the 2005 general election campaign, he was accused of racism. </p>
<p>However, our correspondent says immigration is now back on the political agenda. </p>
<p>He says: &ldquo;One reason politicians can debate it again, perhaps, is that the latest wave of immigration is different. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The million Eastern Europeans who&rsquo;ve come to the UK in the last three or four years are not looking to settle for good. Their motives are economic. And perhaps most importantly they are white. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty years after Enoch Powell, the issues of race and immigration have been separated once more.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Immigration Minister Liam Byrne said the government knew immigration was a top concern among voters. </p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;That is why 2008 sees the biggest shake-up to immigration and border security in 45 years, with a points system like the one in Australia and new rules to make people earn their stay in the UK, including speaking English and abiding by our rules. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what is going to make our immigration system fit for the future.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Source: British Social Attitudes Survey. Years with 99 boxes instead of 100 are where figures did not round to 100% </p>
<p>For the BBC/Ipsos MORI poll results were based on a nationally representative sample of 1,000 GB adults aged 18+ years. Interviews were conducted by telephone using Random Digit Dialling. Fieldwork was conducted on 11-13 April, 2008. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because more and more whites are realizing that being pro-white is instinctual and is part of self-preservation.  It has nothing to do with racism or prejudice.  It is natural to prefer one&rsquo;s own company.</p>
<p>the world would be a far better place if everyone minded their own business and stayed within their own borders.<br/>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all, thanks to the internet many people are recognising the normality and correctness of their stance on race issues, stances which in the past they have been vilified for.  I don&rsquo;t consider myself to be racially prejudiced either, at least not in the way that has been traditionally considered racially prejudiced by the Multicultist nation wreckers. Truly &#8216;Racially prejudiced&rsquo; people are those that call other peoples insulting names, stigmatise them, attack them and treat them with disrespect. All the British people were doing was sitting in their pubs drinking warm beer and when they looked around they saw that their government had betrayed them and their heritage, sold their country out to hostile aliens and then called THEM British. I would imagine the average Briton considers it is their right to live in a harmonious, homogenous,riot and ghetto free country and that this is not a prejudicial state of mind at all. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at some of the Enoch Powell &#8216;Rivers of Blood&rsquo; speech etc. videos on You Tube, I had always understood that there was no video available so it&rsquo;s a bitter-sweet experience to see this wonderful man speak so eloquently and lovingly of his country.  Will another man like Enoch Powell ever step forward?<br/>

			<p>75% now feel the racial tension but describe themselves as less prejudiced. What?<br/>
These people are lying. Not having access to a gun makes them put a happy face on their terror.<br/>
People lie all the time for less serious reasons than the threat of genocide in Britain.<br/>
I recently read statements by the Marketing Director for Carl&rsquo;s Junior and Hardee&rsquo;s, where meat is considered a condiment. He said people lie all the time on their marketing surveys. &ldquo;<br/>
&ldquo;They say they want more salads to make themselves feel good. Then they order more french fries.&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;They said they wanted healthy grilled chicken sandwiches. We sold two last year.&rdquo;<br/>

			<p>If this reflects racial consciousness in Britain then it is a good thing.  If all they are upset with is other White people and they care not about non-Whites, then I&rsquo;m inclined to believe that they have largely missed the point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high time Whites the world over shake off the oppression of race blindness and multiculturalsim.  If Britons want a British society, then let them have it.  If they cease to be White in the process, then why bother?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still holding out hope for the White British to make a come back.</p>

It&rsquo;s amazing how much the make up(and attitude) of Western Countries has changed over the last fifty years.<br/>

			<p>This poll demonstrates that, as always, the people on the ground know far more than the politicians with their pet theories and social engineering.</p>
<p>Britain is now experiencing the biggest demographic change of any Western country since the Byzantine Empire was overcome by the Turks.  600,000 Third-World immigrants arrive in the UK every year  &mdash;   almost half of the numbers that come to the USA, a much bigger country  &mdash;   while 500,000 frustrated Britons leave for good.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten so bad that many of the best-selling books in the bookstores in England are foreign language courses for just about anything  &mdash;   Finnish, Italian, German, Greek, Portuguese, Spanish  &mdash;   that will give the fed-up Brits a leg up in escaping Britain, to go either to a (somewhat) better European country, or to South American locales like Chile or Paraguay, which are rapidly becoming new heartlands of what&rsquo;s left of the West.  Canada and Australia, of course, have decided to follow in the footsteps of the UK&rsquo;s stifling PC culture while conducting similar replacement of the base population, so they, too, are seeing a mass exodus.  As even we in the USA are beginning to see.  </p>
<p>So in other words, the UK is now gaining distinction for its formula of radical social and demographic engineering, one that is being copied in Canada, Australia, Sweden and much of the USA.  The people in power want to get rid of their white populations and replace them with pliable, easily exploitable Third World populations.  They&rsquo;re getting their wish, as their countries fall apart.</p>

<p>Thats a lie.  The last serious race riots were in 2005, in Birmingham.  Blacks and Asians (Pakistanis, Bangladeshis) fought each other and the police and 2 people DIED! Is that not serious enough for you? Or does it not count as a race riot when white people arent involved?  </p>

			<p>True Resistance, you can wait till hell freezes over.  The British are NOT coming back any more than the Ancient Greeks did.  There will continue to be an Anglo-Celt diaspora as the situation over there deteriorates.  In the end, no racially aware Anglo-Celt will want to live near the multicultural wreckage of British civilization.  WW2 pretty much fried the brains of most Britons and they are not capable of thinking along lines that would restore their former homogeneity.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s heartening news that so many feel racial violence likely, but it&rsquo;s too vague a sentiment to read too much into it.  Many American white integrationists would probably feel inclined to agree that blacks are likely to riot somewhere in America in the event of an Obama defeat, yet this hardly a call for separation or segregation.</p>

&#8220;However, the BBC poll finds many people share that view.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
And only elitists as out-of-touch with reality as people who work for the BBC would be surprised by that finding. Nick Griffin and the BNP could have told you that   &mdash;   indeed, HAVE BEEN telling you that   &mdash;   for years. Enoch Powell tried telling you back in 1968 and, for his troubles, was called every name under the sun and chased out of polite society. </p>
<p>BTW, Nordic&rsquo;s quotes from the Carl&rsquo;s Jr. marketing man are great. Reminds me of the routine hypocrisy most people display when answering questionnaires about their TV-viewing habits. Surveyors have got used to the fact that most folks will LIE about what they watch to make themselves sound smarter, they&rsquo;ve developed a devious work-around. Ask someone what they watch on TV and they&rsquo;ll answer with, &#8220;In our house we watch the BETTER kinds of programming   &mdash;   you know, PBS, nature documentaries, news and public-affairs shows,&#8221; etc. </p>
<p>So those conducting the studies have learned instead to ask: &#8220;What do your NEIGHBORS watch?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Who, them? Oh, those people, they just watch a lot of garbage.

<p>&ldquo;This finding may reflect not what is happening today but the story that&rsquo;s been told of the last 40 years &mdash; that if you get people of different kinds together then eventually there&rsquo;s going to be trouble.&rdquo; </p>

			<p>&#8220;Of the 1,000 people asked, 60% said the UK had too many immigrants and half wanted foreigners encouraged to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the population were given the facts about the dangers, troubles and travails about allowing a foreign force that hates <br/>
them into the country only the biggest fools would fail to  react negatively.</p>
<p>Keep in mind these poll figures are predicated on an ongoing governmental propaganda campaign faovoring immigrants and demonizing those who dare to complain about immigrant animal torture, woman beating and oppression, polygamy, bombings, riots, racial clashes, black ineptitude and laziness, and a push to force Sharia law on the population. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humorous that the government figuratively holds a knife to the throat of every citizen there in an attempt to silence complaints, yet in spite of it all they still have 60% who know full well that they&rsquo;re being screwed by the elitist pigs.</p>
<p>Their answer to the problem, of course, is not to tighten up on immigration severely, but to come up with more disingenuous babble to try to offset the prevailing thought via flim flam and greater threats.</p>
<p>In the UK they tried Nick Griffen for simply telling the truth.  In France they did the same to Brigette Bardot.</p>
<p>Both countries are ON THE BRINK and with this damaged economic  global steam roller now upon them I wonder if any Brits are thinking of building a new set of gallows and if France is oiling up its guillotine?  If I were part of the leftist elitist class, I&rsquo;d be shifting my funds to South America about now and ala O.J. Simpson I&rsquo;d be sending away for a beard and a pair of dark glasses, after sitting down and outlining a viable exit strategy.</p>
<p>All leftist elitists are fools, but a few are aware that when opposition to their perverted agendas reach a point where the truth is getting out frequently it&rsquo;s time to look for safer places.  And even the dumb ones catch on eventually.  </p>

<p>In the highest leadership ranks of western governments today there seems to be only one view of what to do about this species-wide phenomenon - the creation of laws and policies that will inevitably bring integration and miscegenation to succeeding generations. </p>
<p>But what if this expectation of changing human nature is ignorantly shallow and foolishly optimistic? What if human racial and cultural differences are so deeply ingrained through hundreds of thousands of years of isolated tribal evolution, that at their deepest level, they cannot yield to compromise?</p>
<p>If so, it&rsquo;s already past time for leaders to develop an alternate plan B - how to best encourage separate and peaceful tribal world relations.  </p>

			<p>Back in the seventies when I left Blighty,  the lefties were gearing up to tear apart the Anglo Celt society. They did a first class job and should be congratulated on their success. The papers, the telly, the rock and roll idiocy stomped the sheeple into jelly with their love the world nonsense.<br/>
No one raised a hand to stop them, and once we saw what they did  to Enoch Powell we knew it was over.<br/>
The multi culti socialists from Eton, Winchester and et cetera were just itching to make an end of the culture and they did and there was no resistance.<br/>
They are here in the states now and you can bet that these Eton, Winchester, Ox- bridge brats are itching again to bring down another anglo-society. And none will resist.</p>

			<p>There is a Canadian writer who writes on the negative effects of multiculturalism, radical feminism, and other such topics, as they relate to the New World Order. Dr. Henry Makow has suggested that elitist bankers are part of the New World Order and are based in England. This got me to thinking that some agency in England, is probably the source of many of the problems experienced by the Western World. It is probably those agents based in England that Dr. Makow speaks of, who have caused Englands massive non-western immigration past and present. Just a thought to be validated by further observation.</p>

			<p>I am shocked the BBC would even conduct such a poll, at least where white Brits are concerned. I am even more surprised that people would even have the courage to give an honest reply. Modern day Britons are often paranoid about even being honest about their feelings regarding race, and for good reason! Simply speaking out on such matters could get them arrested. Whilst their immigrant population can openly give sermons on the street about Westerners and all their evils. The song used to be There will always be an England. If only it were true.</p>

<p>Colt, you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding.  England is sick but America is in intensive care. Our nonwhites now at 1/3 of the population and growing.  Our culture is all but gone and our society thoroughly de-Westernized.  If anything, the US is influencing other countries in Europe to adopt this crazy multicult nonsense.  With the EU now the largest economy in the world and the financial center of the world shifting to London, Europe needs to shake off the US and take up their original mantle as the defender of the West.  Get those US soldiers out of the continent. Europe is wealthy enough to pay for its own defense.  America is a fading power. As our demographics change further, Europe will more and more view the US as a hostile alien entity.  <br/>

			<p>In the U.S., the Navajo have a &#8220;nation within a nation&#8221; that is the size of West Virginia: No non-Navajoes are allowed to enter without permission and must be accompanied at all times by a Navajo.<br/>
Yet Navajos have the same access to the rest of the U.S. that everyone else does.<br/>
This is allowed to preserve Navajo culture and ethnic purity.<br/>
So why is this not allowed for various white/European ethnic groups too?</p>

<p>I was thinking as I read down through the comments that maybe the French Brigette Bardot could teach the British Nick Griffin how the French build guillotines.  You sort of beat me to it.</p>
<p>The elites think the best course for them is to wipe out the white working class and white middle class&hellip;that they can &#8216;manage&rsquo; what is left of human population, with themselves, of course, on top.  Great plan, but its never been done before.  No one knows that it will work.</p>
<p>Once the white elite are a very, very small minority population in the world, even with their planned reduction of human population, it still won&rsquo;t take much to upset their apple cart.  What then? Who will they turn to?  They certainly will not be welcomed by people like me or you.</p>
<p>The wheels of justice turn slow but they turn fine.  And in the Wheel of Life, those on the top end up at the bottom of the wheel, getting ground up into paste.  Hold that thought&hellip;it will carry you through the hard times.</p>

			<p>Agree with the 7:26. The America that influences the rest of the world is Hollywood and transnational business. As John O&rsquo;Sullivan said todays America is a utopia for the left. As a conservative I am anti American but pro the European American people. The US should be warning for the rest of world rather than a goal to aim for.</p>

<p>True indeed! And even though they were free to spout off with their anti-American, today in Great Britain, they are not free to do the same when it comes to their immigrant popualation. Their loony laws lean heavily in favor of non whites. These days, school girls are getting arrested for complaining to their teachers, they can&rsquo;t do group studies with fellow students, who don&rsquo;t speak English. Town councils will come knocking at the doors of British citizens daring to fly the union flag, demanding they take it down, lest they offend foreigners. Patriotic hymns are now banned from the schools, since they too, are considered offensive to non whites. And the slightest slur against a non white can get them arrested for racial abuse. The country has turned on it&rsquo;s own citizens, forcing them to keep in line or face criminal prosecution. And it is not just in the UK, look at what France is doing to Brigette Bardot. The people very likely aren&rsquo;t happy about any of this, but they dare not speak out about it.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;If it&rsquo;s true that 60% of the people feel this way, then why isn&rsquo;t the BNP getting 60% of the votes?&#8221;</p>
<p>   I think it&rsquo;s because the British crave respectability over everything else. According to the controlled media, privileged elite etc., voting for the BNP is not respectable. It&rsquo;s time to stop giving a damn about British respectability and vote for your survival formerly Great Britain! </p>

			<p>True Resistance, you can wait till hell freezes over. The British are NOT coming back any more than the Ancient Greeks did. There will continue to be an Anglo-Celt diaspora as the situation over there deteriorates. In the end, no racially aware Anglo-Celt will want to live near the multicultural wreckage of British civilization. WW2 pretty much fried the brains of most Britons and they are not capable of thinking along lines that would restore their former homogeneity.</p>

<p>A little reeducation goes a long way.  I tend to think that if a few brave patriots were to lead by example then many people would do what lots of people like to do, i.e. follow the strongest leaders.</p>
<p>We can either try to preserve what is left of the White race or submit to destruction.  </p>
<p>Where ever you live you will have the most influence.  I can&rsquo;t do much for Britain but I&rsquo;m not the only ex-Multicult(ural)ist who wants to totally dismantle the former ideology which misled me for so many years.</p>
<p>Let a couple of White dupes know the score and they may just start questioning diversity.  Remember that multiculturalism is built on deception and ignorance, despite claims to the contrary.  Ever wonder why multi&rsquo;s tend to get really pissed off or really ashamed when you confront them?  </p>

<p> Sadly you are quite correct. Britain gained NOTHING from the war and would have probably been better off if it hadn&rsquo;t fought at all. If anything, I would say that the &#8216;loser&rsquo; Germany is better off today in just about every way then the &#8216;victor&rsquo; Great Britain. Talk about a hollow victory. </p>

			<p>VOTE BNP and get your family and friends to vote BNP.  It is truly a matter of cultural survival.  It is time to say ENOUGH to this insane program of cultural suicide.   Our real enemy at this time isn&rsquo;t the non-whites and the Muslims; they are just a disease of the skin. (To steal a line from Chiang Kai Shek)   Our real enemy is the misguided white liberal voters who have allowed the globalist elites to enact these measures to destroy us; they are a disease of the heart.</p>
<p>Educate yourself first and then start working on those close to you.  Forward them e-mails and don&rsquo;t be afraid to speak up and tell the truth as you see it.   When you start censoring your own thoughts and words then you are playing the slave role that the multi-cultural globalist elites want you to play.   Start shunning liberal whites who are race traitors and enemies of the West.  We outnumber the white fools 2 to 1 but because most of us are afraid to speak they imagine that they are in the majority.  Until the rest of us start speaking out clearly, intelligently and frequently we will not change things. </p>
<p>AMREN is a good place to educate yourself and great for forwarding emails to the sleepers who are close to us but we have to stop just preaching to the choir.   White nationalism is not a sin; it is simply a matter of demanding the same rights of association and cultural pride that the Anglo-saxon white culture has extended to every other ethnicity on the planet. </p>

Yes indeed.  I get that idea very strongly when reading the comments posted here by many of our British friends (with allowance for a few exceptions). Most of them STILL just don&rsquo;t get it, despite all their anger and disgruntled complaining. I mean the futility of the war, the deception of Churchill, and all that. They still have the wool pulled over their eyes.</p>
<p>True, most Americans still don&rsquo;t get it either. But, sad to say, the British are even worse in that respect. They have been brainwashed right down to their roots!  They are also much more fearful of saying anything not approved by the establishment thought police.  Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t they be afraid?  They can go to jail for it. At least we can&rsquo;t (yet).<br/>

The British are far more concerned with being &#8220;nice&#8221;. Americans don&rsquo;t give a damn.   Most of them don&rsquo;t care and will say whatever they think. The problem (with Americans) is that so few of them think.</p>
