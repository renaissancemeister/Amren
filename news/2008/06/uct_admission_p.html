						<p>The University of Cape Town&rsquo;s admission guidelines are the subject of a complaint lodged with the Human Rights Commission by the Freedom Front Plus in the Western Cape.</p>
<p>The FF Plus claims the university&rsquo;s admissions policy for medical studies is racist, the party&rsquo;s youth campus spokesperson James Kemp said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to Kemp, the guidelines stipulated that black students obtain an average of 74% to qualify for medical studies, coloureds 78%, Indians 88% and whites 91%.</p>
<p>Slamming the policy as unconstitutional, Kemp said it was &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; that years after the scrapping of laws on racial classification these types of practices were still allowed at public institutions.<br>

			<p>Wish it was that blatant here in the States&hellip; we have to suffer along with a pretend-we-are-all-equal policy that is a fraud and obviously pandering to the unqualified. </p>

<p>At least they are being honest about it. Perhaps a fact finding trip or two to the USA could help them overcome that barrier. <br>

<p>And, right there, in a nutshell, we have a blaring summation of the racial issue worldwide.</p>
<p>To the people on here who laud blacks coming out of Africa with medical degrees, here&rsquo;s hoping you&rsquo;ll be able to take full advantage of their expertise, because people like me sure as hell won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Exactly what Rushton was denounced as saying!   Whites are the smartest of this group!  They&rsquo;ve admitted it.  Blacks SHOULD be outraged, but apparently they&rsquo;re not bright enough to realise what the University is saying!   And since people of Chinese descent have been declared &#8220;black&#8221; for the purposes of affirmative action policies like this one, very few real blacks will actually be admitted!</p>

			<p>It is bound to happen here as well&hellip;</p>
<p>I just became a lawyer a year ago. They originally were supposed to make the Bar exam much more difficult in New York, with the passing score to increase incrementally every year for three years, but after the first year of using a slightly increased score, the African American pass rate plummeted, and would have dropped well below  50 percent, so the Bar Association freaked out and halted the increases in the passing score. </p>
<p>They published a big study with all the embarrassing data right here on the Bar Association website: </p>
<p><a href="/ncberep.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.nybarexam.org/ncberep.pdf</a> </p>
<p>As a result if your lawyer seems like an idiot, you have the diversitoids to thank for that, since they refuse to let standards be raised&hellip;. If they could find a way to legally make he white and black passing rate different I don&rsquo;t have the slightest doubt that it would be instantly implemented.</p>

			<p>This is what whites need Around the World.Organisations like the VFplus to expose the racist Admission policies of Education institutions.Whites need to vote as a interest group like many of us do here in South Africa.Jared Taylor should start the Naacp=National Association for the Advancement of Cacausian people.</p>

			<p>Here in california, the K-12th public school system, a system which once produced smart forward thinking citizens that got us through the Cold War and made us the most dominant nation on earth has been flooded in parts of the country with tens upon tens of millions of legal and illegal immigrants in a single generation forcing the educational system to dumb down it&rsquo;s cirriculum to the lowest common denominator in an effort to accommodate them; a practice that has not brought favorable or desirable results. </p>
<p>In my father&rsquo;s day, high school students gained measurable aptitudes in higher math, engineering, pre-college science, and solid English courses that led to real competency right along with trades like mechanics and electrical vocational courses. Today, where I live, scared teachers worry if they can read and write English and hope they aren&rsquo;t in a gang before graduating them. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it. Public education isn&rsquo;t bringing the desired results. I don&rsquo;t know any better way to say it. We spend more time and money seeking to turn kids into entitled disparate modern liberals than we do instilling in them with traditional American values, a solid work ethic, and empowering them with a high level of education and a responsibility to make this country something they can be proud of. That&rsquo;s what we used to do and it worked. </p>
<p>What we have today is a system the elitists created. A system they overcharge us for that brings little in the way of desirable results. They ask us to pay for our own demise with the logic that it&rsquo;s good for us when the only thing it&rsquo;s good for is their own careers and ideology. </p>

<p>have blacks ever wondered, &#8220;maybe we JUST can&rsquo;t compete equally because it&rsquo;s not in us to?&#8221;  </p>

			<p>The really odd thing is, there is no legal basis for racial classification.  Once South African people were classified by race, but now we are all equal.  If I were to claim to be black, who could prove me wrong?  But alas, logic is not the ANC&rsquo;s strong point.</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the irony that South African liberals refuse to see. I am an alumnus of UCT (aka &#8220;Little Moscow on the Hill&#8221;) and they have been doing this kind of thing since the mid 90&rsquo;s.</p>
