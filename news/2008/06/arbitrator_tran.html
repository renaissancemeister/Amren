<h1>Arbitrator: Transit Manager Fired for His Race</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Dees, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), June 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The company that manages Durham&rsquo;s transit system unlawfully fired a former general manager in 2005 because he is white, possibly influenced by comments from Mayor Pro Tem Cora Cole-McFadden, an arbitrator has ruled. MV Transportation was ordered to pay Thomas Hartley $172,844.</p>
<p>Hartley was fired in late summer 2005 a few months after Cole-McFadden said MV &ldquo;needed some diversity in [its] management ranks,&rdquo; according to the arbitration award. At the time, all three top positions were filled by white men. Yolanda White, a black woman, was hired to replace Hartley, despite being under qualified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is telling that Ms. White did not meet MV&rsquo;s own published qualifications for the job of general manager, as she lacked a college degree and prior relevant experience managing a contract,&rdquo; Arbitrator Jonathan Harkavy wrote. White was replaced last year as general manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of making a legitimate and measured business judgment about the qualifications of other potential applicants both inside and outside of MV, the skids were greased to ensure that Ms. White was the selectee.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Well, there you go folks.</p>
<p>Quantity (of non-White) over Quality (White).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the future.</p>
<p>Actually, as I&rsquo;ve posted elsewhere, our future is more like a combination of Russia 1917, Lebanon, and Zimbabwe, with a little Brazil for good measure.</p>
<p>Unless we observe blind obedience (and even if we do) to the Real Owners of this Country, then we&rsquo;ll be not so nicely eliminated.  That is, unless we can organize and defend ourselves.  But, though I wouldn&rsquo;t entirely rule that out, I just don&rsquo;t see it happening any time soon.  </p>

Up to recently, &#8220;Blacks&#8221; employed in positions dealing with the public, such as transit workers, generally pretty well restrained their open insolence and expressed hostility towards the unfortunate Whites who needed to use their services. Offended Whites could always complain to White managers who were in position to oversee the &#8220;Black&#8221; personnel. For all the good it would do - unless Government watchdogs had those White managers so intimidated that they feared acting to restrain them -  they would have usually acted to keep the behavior of the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; in line and within the bounds of civilized conduct.</p>
<p>As Governmental favoritism  against Whites becomes more to the forefront, and &#8220;Blacks&#8221; are more and more moved into &#8220;management&#8221; and &#8220;supervisory&#8221; positions, it is becoming useless for Whites to waste their time lodging complaints. Its likely to be even more so as time goes by.</p>

			<p>Happens all the time.  Los Angeles Police department has accepted only hispanics into the academy for several years now.  40 pounds overweight at age 22, &#8220;minor&#8221; felony convictions, illiterate, reading at third grade level, whatever, they are hispanic and that&rsquo;s what counts.</p>
<p>I remember the black San Francisco Probation Officer who was finally exposed as (1) Having dropped out of high school instead of having the required BA degree. (2) 14 felony convictions and several county jail terms (3) He was on Probation himself in Alameda county.</p>
<p>He was discovered when an Alameda county cop who had arrested him a couple times came over to the San FRancisco Courthouse to testify in a trial.</p>

<p>To Ronald:</p>
<p>MV Transportation was ordered to pay Mr. Hartley $172 thousand plus dollars.  The article did state that.  The more Whites there are that lodge complaints the more difficult it will be for under-qualified non-Whites to get promoted above their capabilities.  Most Whites are afraid to do this,unfortunately.  It won&rsquo;t pay to take a negative attitude with respect to this situation.  The problem with Whites is that they&rsquo;ve had their &#8216;fight&rsquo; conditioned out of them by the controlled media.  It is coming back, but we may have to lose a lot more before any kind of progress is seen.</p>

			<p>The fact that this even appeared in the MSM is amazing.</p>
<p>Has any MSM publication ever explicitly pointed out the utter failure of AA?</p>
<p>&#8221;..Yolanda White, a black woman, was hired to replace Hartley, despite being under qualified&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Ms. White did not meet MV&rsquo;s own published qualifications for the job of general manager, as she lacked a college degree&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Does this not prove that she was ONLY hired because she was a black woman, promoted well past her abilities, over more qualified Whites?  Would a White ever be hired who lacked the &#8216;published qualifications?&rsquo;  This has been obvious for years but it seems Whites are starting to fight back  &mdash;   and win.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; White was replaced last year as general manager&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope there&rsquo;s more of this as Whites have been openly discriminated against in the job market for several decades now.</p>
<p>Even the arbiter&rsquo;s wise words were set in print.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Instead of making a legitimate and measured business judgment about the qualifications of other potential applicants both inside and outside of MV, the skids were greased to ensure that Ms. White was the selectee&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kudos to the editor of the Raleigh News &amp; Observer and writer Matt Dees (couldn&rsquo;t be related to Morris Dees, could he?).</p>
<p>Maybe the MSM is starting to print more articles favorable to Whites because their subscriber base has dropped off so much(because so many of us are tired of their leftist bias).  Now if they&rsquo;d start publishing stories about black-on-White crime maybe I&rsquo;d renew my subscriptions.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s so 80&rsquo;s. Already been done. That&rsquo;s what happened after Reagan fired the air traffic controllers (who as a group went on strike). At least, in ghettos and places like the local childrens community center, mucho ads for air traffic controller training/jobs were posted up. I wonder how militant, pro-European centered community centers for children, paid for by the tax payer, would go over, propped up in &#8216;white&rsquo; neighborhoods all across America?</p>

			<p>This kind of firing happens all the time, but only a few Whites have the courage to sue for justice. <br>
Whites should decide once and for all that they will no longer be sacrificial lambs on the altar of PC.</p>

			<p>Im working on my commercial pilot&rsquo;s license, so I use the ATC system regularly, and I can say that for the most part the controllers are easy to understand, but a few places (Memphis Center is a good example) seems to have a lot of controllers on staff that aren&rsquo;t quite so easy to understand. I have *no idea* why</p>

<p>All these relatively good jobs blacks or other non-whites have almost completely taken over, in the drive for &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, if they were to start a program to recruit whites there for whatever their insane reasons, I wonder what it would be called? It would be pretty funny. I can imagine it being called &#8216;re-diversity&rsquo;. Whatever word they&rsquo;d use, I bet it would be pretty funny.<br>

			<p>If they want to promote &#8220;diversity,&#8221; then why don&rsquo;t they fill the ranks with top-performing students from predominantly Black universities.  There are very promising students there.  The problem is, &#8220;diversity&#8221; mongers like Cora Cole-McFadden always want to fill management and executive positions with &#8220;underprivileged&#8221; and always underqualified people.  Then, the same old thing happens every time - they take over the position, the people who report to them resent them for getting the position without proper credentials, they run the organization into the ground, then blame it on &#8220;unfair treatment.&#8221;  Then, their stories of &#8220;injustice&#8221; make the &#8220;news&#8221;papers.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m beating a dead horse, but I cant help it: Forced diversity is dumb.</p>

			<p>This happened to my father, a few months before I graduated high school. He hadn&rsquo;t missed a day of work in 12 years before this. (My parents taught us that there&rsquo;s no good reason for missing work. Their feelings have changed about the job market.) He didn&rsquo;t get his pension or retirement from all the years that he worked. </p>
