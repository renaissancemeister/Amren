<h1><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-chinatowneast19-2008jun19,0,5800685.story">New Chinatown Grows in Far East San Gabriel Valley</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Pierson, Los Angeles Times, June 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In fact, much of the eastern San Gabriel Valley has more in common with Taipei, Beijing or Shanghai than it does with neighboring Los Angeles. Here, Asian-immigrant entrepreneurs have transformed once-sleepy suburbia into a Chinatown like no other.</p>
<p>They are far from struggling newcomers trying to achieve the American Dream in other Chinese enclaves such as Monterey Park and San Gabriel farther to the west.</p>
<p>Here, the power of Chinese culture and its economy is on display, said Joel Kotkin, an expert in urban affairs and ethnic economies.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s so overwhelming,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a suburb anchored to the tribal economy of the Chinese and China. They have an ideal life with a spacious backyard and institutions and amenities close by. You have a 15-minute commute to work rooted in city of Industry. You don&rsquo;t have to step out.&#8221;</p>
<p>And many don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The combined populations of Rowland Heights, Hacienda Heights, Walnut and Diamond Bar have not only doubled in the last two decades but also are now two-thirds Asian.</p>
<p>Close to 40% of the businesses in Industry are ethnic Chinese-owned.</p>
<p>Up the hill from Life Plaza, at Blandford Elementary School, close to 60% of the students are Asian.</p>
<p>Many are the children of wealthy immigrants, dropped off in luxury cars by their mothers. Many fathers are absent, having to work in China.</p>
<p>The school recently had to revamp its lunch policy. The main office was overwhelmed at noon with mothers trying to deliver hot lunches either from home or Chinese restaurants. Now they must leave the meals on a cart outside the school gates at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Parent volunteer Rosy Chong said she overheard a newly arrived Korean parent&rsquo;s daughter ask her mother, &#8220;When are we going to America?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She thought Rowland Heights was a stopover&#8221; in Asia, Chong said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Teacher Cindy Kim sees it firsthand in her classroom. In an environment so dominated by Chinese and Koreans, it&rsquo;s difficult to teach lessons about other cultures.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had Cesar Chavez assemblies, and it was difficult for them to comprehend,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;I&rsquo;d ask for background information, and I wouldn&rsquo;t get a lot of input. They&rsquo;d ask, &lsquo;Who is that?&rsquo; Our big holiday is Chinese New Year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school usually holds its book sale after the New Year&rsquo;s celebration, knowing the students have &#8220;lucky money&#8221; to spend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like many middle-class Chinese and Taiwanese immigrants, the Tsais opted for the area over more established enclaves like Monterey Park and Alhambra, partly because the homes were newer and larger.</p>
<p>The Tsais&rsquo; fortunes increased dramatically in 2000 when Leg Avenue began making and designing sexy Halloween costumes for women.</p>
<p>They used old connections to secure factories outside Taipei and in Guangzhou and Shanghai to manufacture the designs affordably.</p>
<p>The racy nurse and pirate outfits became so popular the company went from $1 million in sales in 2000 to recording $87 million last year.</p>
<p>Their original Rowland Heights property has grown to become a 1.5-acre plot featuring three houses shared by more than 20 family members and a fleet of luxury cars.</p>
<p>The family imported ancient wood chairs and stone from Taiwan to form a table under the gazebo in the courtyard. Their annual Chinese New Year&rsquo;s parties have become affairs for 400. This year&rsquo;s party featured Peking duck, rowdy Taiwanese dice games and the doling of $30,000 in red &#8220;lucky money&#8221; envelopes to visitors.</p>

			<p>This is the sort of immigration story I like to hear.  It&rsquo;s the only one that can maintain economic growth, keep the national IQ at or above the 100 mark, and put downward pressure on the crime rate.</p>

			<p>Another reason to bring back the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Chinese Exclusion was a wonderfull thing. The Colonization of American territory by China should not be tolerated. It&rsquo;s really amazing isn&rsquo;t it. Overpopulated China gets to export it&rsquo;s population to overpopulated California. I hate to say it, but America is becomming a joke nation.</p>
<p>What is the point of saving California&rsquo;s endangered species. There is plenty of them in the San Gabriel mountains. I&rsquo;m not interested in saving California&rsquo;s geneline future generations of Chinese living in California. I hope California becomes an ecological waste land. The current drought -worst in twenty years-should help speed up the ecological death of California.</p>
<p>Will vdare.com cover this story or we get some more of Steve Sailer&rsquo;s hyperdimensional multiple regression analysis of the Hindu &#8220;Americans&#8221; IQ. Some people and organizations that should know better just aren&rsquo;t serious.</p>
<p>At least count there are one million Iranains living in California. Pray for more droughts,an economic collapse and other apocalyptic events, bring on the dystopia.</p>

<p>That is, it&rsquo;s a colony of China.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have an ideal life with a spacious backyard and institutions and amenities close by.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is, they&rsquo;ve gotten out of China.</p>

			<p>AMERICA!!!  The world&rsquo;s dumping ground for all its unwanted malcontents, rabble, and criminals who want to set up a colony to mirror the failed one they left.</p>
<p>Diversity means death, the death of a nation, a culture, a nation-state.</p>
<p>The Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans are not so foolish.  </p>

			<p>The Chinese are good, hard-working and honest people. But, they already have China. Isn&rsquo;t 1.5 BILLION asians in China enough? Why do they want America too?</p>

<p><br/>
Crime Rate: Very very very low. Lower even than a similar city with only White people. </p>
<p>High School Graduation Percentage: Very Very Very high. Higest of any race, including Whites. </p>
<p>College Graduation Rates: Very high. Higher even than Whites. </p>
<p>However, these questions really aren&rsquo;t the issues. The Chinese perform above the White level in these three areas. There&rsquo;s no contesting this, as it&rsquo;s well documented by Rushton and others. </p>
<p>The thing that concerns me is, how are they in accepting and assimilating into White American culture? Are they willing participants in their adopted country as far as having national pride and a national identity (ie - being proud of America and being an American citizen)? </p>
<p>Are they or their next generations willing to participate in the defense of this country by joining the Marines or the Army or Navy and possibly dying for their adopted country? </p>

<p>Not me. I don&rsquo;t want ANY non-white immigration. Regardless of IQ levels, immigration of other races means the death of our own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teacher Cindy Kim sees it firsthand in her classroom. In an environment so dominated by Chinese and Koreans, it&rsquo;s difficult to teach lessons about other cultures.</p>

<p>And does anyone think that these immigrants  be there from China, Mexico, Vietnam, Nigeria etc. are going to give one ounce of caring about American history such as the founding fathers?</p>

<p>Chinese faced ridiculous amounts of discrimination before (and still do. Look above for the comment about bringing back the Chinese Exclusion Act) and yet as a whole have succeeded beyond even the level of the citizens of its adopted country (Whites in America). </p>
<p>Blacks and Mexicans ought to be ashamed of themselves. They have no excuses left. </p>

			<p>Having actually grown up in the area I wouldn&rsquo;t call Walnut and Diamond Bar extensions of Asia, the architecture and construction is simply too spread out.  There isn&rsquo;t a real dominance of Chinese or Korean signage.  Now Monterrey park and Rowland Heights on the other hand do look they were pulled out of Asia.  The street scenes in some of these areas do look like Taipei, albeit with far lower population density.</p>
<p>Also the Asian population moved into these areas as they were developing.  Diamond Bar wasn&rsquo;t really developed until the mid 80&rsquo;s Rowland Heights was a pretty desolate place too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say some wonderful businesses were displaced during the demographic transition.  I remember a Japanese man who ran a very fine hobby shop filled with many models and role playing games. Unfortunately his shop did not survive the demographic transition,it was probably frequented far more by whites than Asians.</p>
<p>Old World deli held out for the longest time but it too proved to be unfit for the new ecosystem.</p>
<p>One thing I do notice in my area (Rowland Heights) is alot of empty commercial real estate.  Hollywood Video and another large store are nothing more than empty husks in their respective shopping centers.</p>
<p>The commercial building boom in my area is completely out of control we have numerous empty buildings and even more going up all the time.</p>
<p>Did the Asians contribute to the economic vitality in the area: absolutely.  Its hard to imagine why anyone else would have developed this area with prosperous Orange County to the South and San Marino/Pasadena/Arcadia to the West.  </p>
<p>Personally I feel that this place would probably be more like El Monte or at best Duarte, nice but somewhat underdeveloped.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the area developed so much because of self segregation but it created a natural ecosystems for Asian oriented businesses to develop in that probably wouldn&rsquo;t have survived elsewhere.</p>
<p>When a population hits a particular mark it can support more businesses attracting more people and supporting even more businesses.</p>
<p>Also this area is mini silicon valley.  A number of large Taiwanese electronic/computer companies are here: Olevia,Shuttle,Foxconn,MSI.  They all have signficiant operations in this area.  I would go so far to say that most of the Chinese importers/manufacteres in the US are probably located in this small area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say this is a perfect place to live but its not a bad area.  You can ride your bike at 2:00 a.m. and feel reasonably safe.  Many of the Chinese restaurants are open until 12:00 or 2:00.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong in many ways I do miss pre 1986 America.  The architecture the businesses but society is different not just because of race.  We don&rsquo;t value models and role playing games or reading the way we did back then.  Crown books has gone from one of my favorite stores to a poor imitation of itself.</p>
<p>But in other ways Rowland Heights is a nice place to live.  The Japanese food in the few authentic Japanese restaurants here is exceeds anything available in Orange County and costs far less than expensive restaurants such as Blue Fin in Newport Beach.</p>
<p>The Chinese food, if you know where to look is second only to Chinese food in China or Taiwan.</p>
<p>In Rowland Heights especially there are many businesses packed into small areas so your shopping and eating choices are quite immense.  </p>
<p>Is the area foreign:somewhat.  But does the area pull in foreign capital from Asia and facilitate the importation of goods from Asia: absolutely.  This area is key part of the US economy.</p>

			<p><i>Many are the children of wealthy immigrants, dropped off in luxury cars by their mothers. Many fathers are absent, having to work in China.</i></p>
<p>Which is to say the reason for a lot of the wealth is the fact that the fathers have contacts in China they can use to outsource manufacturing to a cheaper place. They&rsquo;re not necessarily working harder than Americans. They also may be helping to relocate jobs from America to China. Over half of the companies in Silicon Valley started by Indian immigrants outsource work to India, so that what appears to be economic &#8220;vitality&#8221; in the US is actually the source of the gian sucking sound.</p>

<p>Given the above information and demographic trends, the answers to your questions are probably 1) very low 2) 100% 3) somewhere in the region of 50 - 60%, in line with affluent East Asian averages.</p>
<p>Does that make them White? No. </p>

			<p>It is a pity that the immigrants from my SE Asian 3rd world country who are living in Los Angeles are not as successful as these chinese. It looks like it is true that the Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans are the Model Minorities that are desireable to an American Community.</p>

			<p>The Chinese want to establish a colony in America, because their living space runs out. Despite the one-child-policy their population is still growing. The Chinese also have a big problem with pollution and soil degradation.</p>
<p>This is not happening since yesterday!<br/>
Look it up it the &#8220;The Rising Tide Of Color&#8221; by Lothrop Stoddard. <br/>
He warned us, but who to heed?</p>
<p>East Asians can think ahead, like Europeans.<br/>
But unlike Europeans they have an extremely well developed sense of group cohesion, unhindered by judeo-christianity and the teachings of the Frankfurt School. </p>
<p>Indians are also very numerous and India is severely overpopulated, but it seems that the Chinese are more intelligent.</p>
<p>Now whe can witness some kind of race happening in North America between these big peoples of India and China, each numbering more than a 1000 million people:<br/>
Who can first invade and conquer new living space??<br/>
(&#8220;Lebensraum&#8221; as we used to call it in Germany)</p>
<p>Now the worst thing for European people (that of course includes Euro-Americans) is to give up America and allow the Chinese to spread there!</p>
<p>The Chinese also try to colonize Australia, with considerable success.<br/>
Australia and New-Zealand is lost in the middle term, therefore the whites down under sould consider moving to America and strengthening our numbers there!<br/>
If Europeans in America give up, no quarter will be given to them. It is a biological fight of life and death - primitve Darwinism in action. Only those with the will to fight will survive.</p>

			<p>You will never see this level of acheivement in a all black or hispanic community, those communities are better known for their level of crime, illegitimate children, welfare recipients, unkempt homes, trashy neighborhoods, and on and on. There&rsquo;s a great story about an asian group in New Orleans, from the worst devatated area, working together have rebuilt their neighborhood helping each other, not relying on gov. handouts, while blacks in that same area are still whining about not being given enough handouts. Somehow most of the media has overlooked this story.</p>

<p>Blandford Principal Jo Ann Lawrence said some parents told her they were reluctant to send their children to another school in the district because there were too many Latino students there.<br/>

			<p>  East Asians in moderate numbers are good for the economy and good citizens. However, mass migration can lead to group conflicts and demands for group rights and ethnic preferences. The incentive to assimilate decreases with large numbers.  Unfortunately, too much immigration has lead to the growth of large ethnic/racial colonies in the United States. Although I&rsquo;m less worried about the Chinese, Japanese and Koreans, than I am about the Mexicans and Central Americans. These Hispanics? have arrived in far greater numbers and are much closer geographically and culturally to their home countries. They are also less well educated and more crime prone. </p>

<p>Native Born White Americans would not be worse off if LEGAL asian immigration was shut down to O. You seem to think they would be worse off. Why is that? If the Chinese Exclusion Act had not been repealed A majority White America would be producing the nations doctors,enginners and scientist just like it did in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moderate&#8221; Asian immigration has led to the evil H-1B and L-1 B visa programs and to over 140 members of the US congress-members of the India policy groiup-on the take of the very wealthy hindu &#8220;American&#8221; community whose representatives like to go on shows such as Lou Dobbs and threaten Native Born White Americnas with political retaliation if the H-1 B and L-1B visa programs.</p>
<p>The &#8220;moderate&#8221; number of asians who entered OUR America in the 1970&rsquo;s were heavily concenttratd in the engineering. They were allowed in and the style wages and jobs from thousands of Native Born White Men who served their naton in WW2-men such as my late father,father of seven- and the Korean war.This is bad enough. But with chain migration,asian numbers increased. The &#8220;moderate number of asians who came into OR America during the 1970s has resulted in a,massive deskilling of the Native Born White American population. It has also resulted in the massive destruction of thousands of years of collective Native Born White American engineering experiencing. Now we are in the realm of genocide. But to make Asian philes such as you Sardonicious, this is of no major consequence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moderate&#8221; levels of asian immgration was and will never be a benefit to the majority Native Born White American population.</p>
<p>I just want to say something the asian fetish that I see on American Renassaince and Vdare.com-Peter Brimleow and Steve Sailer- is appalling.</p>
<p>The Asian colonization of the California State University system is outrageous . This apparently doesn&rsquo;t bother &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; such as Saradonicious.</p>
<p>Asians are not interchageable with Native Born White Americans anywhere in America. If you don&rsquo;t accept this, you are not a White Nationalist. In there on way, Asians in OUR America are just as dangerous as the Mexicans and the Central American gang bangers.</p>

			<p>Looking back into history, it seems to me there is a pattern. From what I understand, white civilizations were spread out around the globe in the ancient world. What happened to these white people? I hypothesize that an influx of Asians into these areas caused the demise of many ancient white civilizations. If this is the case, the white race is in grave peril. I have always been a live and let live type of person. I&rsquo;m just concerned that in the future, the white race is not going to be afforded this option.</p>

<p>Because they are not European. They are not interchangeable with European Americans. American is not an idea nation. Interchabge millions of Native Born White Americans with millions of Chinese of living in China and America will cease to exist. This should be obvious to you.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe this, well go to San Gabriel Valley. When the Asians move in, Native Born White Americans move out. </p>
<p>As far as the legitmate racial interests of White Amerians go, there is no economic,ecological and cultural justification for importing Asians into OUR America. WE are competing with them for the scarce resources of America.</p>

			<p>  I have lived in the San Gabriel Valley for all of my 47 years!  This Asian colonization started with Monterey Park, then spread to Alhambra, Arcadia, San Marino and also Rowland Heights, Hacienda Heights, Diamond Bar, Walnut! Other cities like El Monte, Rosemead etc. have large percentages of Asians as well. This is invasion and COLONIZATION~!  Entire boulevards are lined with Chinese-language signs and businesses.  It is an absolute DISGRACE what our so-called &#8220;leaders&#8221; have done to America through this insane white-replacement immigration policy! I am ashamed of &#8220;our&#8221; Government that HATES white people so very much as to allow this!  I cannot have children but it doesn&rsquo;t bother me much anymore as I see what butchery has been inflicted on the culture and future of my country!</p>

<p>As most Amreners would probably concur Chinese people are not stupid and will hire the best person possible.  I personally know of several Chinese owned companies where the top decision makers are white guys.  I know one company in particular where the US sales manager (white fellow) is paid more than anyone in the home office in Taipei, including the CEO.</p>
<p>Many of these Chinese companies are quite diverse and hire people from a number of races and backgrounds, like good capitalists they just want the best people working for them.  Many Chinese companies don&rsquo;t set out to be diverse by any means but often end up with a diverse mix of people here in California because that&rsquo;s what might work best in their environment or industry.</p>
<p>As I said earlier the San Gabriel area would have probably been completely overlooked in favor of the Los Angeles or Orange County if the Chinese hadn&rsquo;t come in and relocated various operations here on a large scale.</p>
<p>I have yet to see a credible case of whites leaving an area because of the Asians are &#8220;taking over&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Admitedly working in a predominantly Chinese area is different than working in a predominantly white area but in both cases I would argue it seems as though the best and brightest do succeed, regardless of race.</p>

<p>Yes, and I am sure that countries in East Asia could benefit from entire communities of hard working whites moving in as well.  The bottom line is that the whites don&rsquo;t belong there, and the native Asians can get the job done themselves.  The same applies to America.  Whites don&rsquo;t need Asians in their countries.  Do you respect that?  What is hard to understand about this?  As whites, we don&rsquo;t owe anybody anything.  Why can&rsquo;t people leave us alone?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll that&rsquo;s not really happening you&rsquo;re actually seeing more Western expats enter China, in fact a friend of mine might be transfering to Shanghai(he&rsquo;s white by the way).</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you respect that? What is hard to understand about this? As whites, we don&rsquo;t owe anybody anything. Why can&rsquo;t people leave us alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how the world works Courtney we have globalization for example IBM transfered their head buying office from Armonk, New York to Shenzhen China:</p>
<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/IBM-shifts-procurement-HQ-to-China/2110-1014_3-6125686.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.cnet.com/IBM-shifts-procurement-HQ-to-China/2110-1014_3-6125686.html</a></p>
<p>Whether you like it or not corporations are trying to build global structures and that means transferring people around the world.  That means more whites in Asia and some Asians here in the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is invasion and COLONIZATION~! Entire boulevards are lined with Chinese-language signs and businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say this change has simply been for the better period, with all things there is a give and take.  Economically California is still a vibrant state and I would argue that those same Asian businesses make it so.  </p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before many large Taiwanese electronic companies are located in the San Gabriel Valley : Shuttle,MSI Olevia.  These companies pay alot in taxes and develop goods for the US Market and facilitate their importation from factories in Asia.</p>
<p>Many of these Chinese companies are also conduits of investment bringing money from Asia into the US and helping to create economic growth and opportunity for American citizens of all races.  The Japanese did this in Torrance to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s done is done and its more important that you people begin looking at using what&rsquo;s happened to help make America more prosperous instead of simply complaining.  <br/>
You people are always talking about how whites are so innovative and dynamic.  Well here&rsquo;s your chance to prove it.  </p>
<p>Is Asian emigration a challenge or is it an opportunity for creative and intelligent whites to get ahead in a changed environment?  To paraphrase Nietzsche &#8220;that which does not destroy me makes me stronger&#8221;.  Yes it is destroy and not kill.</p>
<p>The future belongs to those with the courage and tenacity to seize it.</p>

			<p>Courtney, I really like a lot of your comments but I have to mention that as a person who is open to some immigration that we allowed many of these people to come in here. By we, I mean white government/society, not us personally. I don&rsquo;t think it is fair to kick them out after offering them a place to stay as long as they are not criminals. </p>
<p>Asian countries, on the other hand, have not attracted many whites as mass immigrants in the past and now that e asians are wealthier, they are resisting any types of permanent immigration. They are justified in not allowing in immigrants, white or otherwise, however I don&rsquo;t think we can penalize productive legal immigrants in our countries for our foolishness. We took them when we thought we needed them. We need to stop current immigraton policies immediately and change how many immigrants we are allowing into our country, I hope the same for Europe.</p>

<p>  When I said moderate, I had in mind maybe 30,000 per year for all of East Asia. This is far smaller than the current numbers.<br/>
Immigration from all countries would be solely based on education, skills and income. I don&rsquo;t approve of the H-1B racket either. <br/>

			<p>The situation is far worse in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. </p>
<p>Sustained mass immigration has transformed Toronto, Sydney and Auckland into heavily Asian populated cities within the space of a few decades. Faced with an Asian flood, the historic white populations of Canada, Australia and New Zealand are increasingly voting with their feet and surrendering their largest cities to Asian, mainly Chinese, immigrants. This large-scale white flight away from the immigrant-impacted areas has accelerated the transformation of these European-founded cities into Asian colonies.</p>
<p>In short, these countries have allowed themselves to become Chinese &#8220;lebensraum&#8221;. In doing so, they are committing national suicide at an alarming pace. </p>
<p>The United States should avoid making the same mistake.</p>

<p>When you consider the damage Asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; have already inflicted on the majority Native Born White population, why should we tolerate any  number above 0. Prior to to the passage of the 1965 immigration refrom act, hardly any Asins were being allowed into America. And during this time period,we put a White man on the moon(this no doubt upsets vdare.com&rsquo;s Brenda Walker) After,1965 most of the Asians comming into OUR America were heavily concentrated in the Engineering profession. Enginereing company executives noticed this and began getting rid of Native Born White American Engineers at places such as the Gruman arospacce, Malcolm Pirne engineering in WEst Chester Count and many other Engineering and aerospace companies across OUR America. The American Engineering Society-founded by Billy Read- was an attempt to fight back against this Asian legal immigrant aggresion against Native Born Whie American Males.</p>
<p>The back of the Asian lobby in this country should be broken and dsposed of as quickly as possible. WE already conceedd an inch to the Asians-30 thousand a year-and  as a consequence, WE are looking at the very real possibility of the massive skilling of the Native Born White American  workforce and the destruction of thousands of years of collective Native Born White Amerian engineering expereince. This is what vdare/com should be focusing on with a laser beam on a daily basis. Instead we get the Asian fetish garbage from Steve Sailer-it is the things that vdare.com and Sailer don&rsquo;t discuss on a daily and weekly basis that makes this inference credible- almost on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The Asians in America are the mortal enemy of the Native Born White American majority. Every White Nationalist should understand this obvious point. </p>

<p>White America needs a extremely painfull and hard kick in the pants. This is the only way White America that will be motivated to save its self from complete racial and econimic dispossession.</p>
<p>It is very clear that it is not possible to reason with people anymore. Way too many White Americans have overadapted to the beltway consensus that is hell bent on destryoing White Americans. White Americans will no longer give their allegiance to this system when the system deprives a critical number of White Americans of  a middle class existence.</p>
<p>A critical number of White Americans have to be shocked and traumatized out their sports comsumption jock sniffing sleep walk. The trance must be broken.</p>
<p>Worst of the worse is better. Native Born White Americans need to develope an extreme phobia of post-1965 non-white immigrants and their offspring.</p>

			<p>As usual the weird pro-Asian sentiment on this forum remains strikingly divisive among the posters. Only Jupiter consistently takes up the sensible pro-White stance in these debates worthy of a website that is supposed to have the best interests of Whites in mind. I appreciate his tireless efforts debating this annoying issue again and again and am glad to see that his intelligent position at least has some support besides my own  &mdash;  thanks to Courtney, Drew and others.  </p>
<p>Indeed, it is this strange almost cult-like worship of Asian intellect here that has disillusioned White separatists like me from supporting Amren financially or attending it&rsquo;s conferences.  I only check in once in awhile to see if anything in regards to this problem has changed.  Invariably I&rsquo;m disappointed and so return to supporting more clearly pro-White sites.</p>
<p>Whether Asians are low-crime or intelligent or whatever is not really the point.  Maybe I&rsquo;m just an unhep ol&rsquo; hayseed but I had thought that the aim of a pro-White site like Amren was to seek solutions to preserving the White race, not to hand off our gene pool and self-created societies to Asians. Are the pro-Asian posters just confused or is it me?</p>
<p>The character or ability of Asians is not relevant, the point is that they are not White people and hence don&rsquo;t belong in our space competing for our jobs, our homes and our mates, spawning half-caste children.  That&rsquo;s the bottom line.<br/>
