						<p>Honk if you love Hispanics.</p>
<p>A license plate that touts &#8220;Hispanics Discovered Florida&#8221; may soon join the 109 specialty tags drivers can choose from.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Danny Ramos, the group&rsquo;s president [National Hispanic Corporate Achievers, a Longwood group that sponsors minority job fairs], said the tag&rsquo;s message is about cultural pride for Florida&rsquo;s 3.6 million Hispanics &mdash; even if not all of Latin American or Spanish descent identify with the term.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every community wants to be recognized for its contributions to society,&#8221; Ramos said. &#8220;I think this is just part of our assimilation process and our acceptance in Florida.&#8221;</p>
<p>A preliminary concept for the plate seeks to unify Hispanics by going back to their historical roots &mdash; when Spaniards colonized the peninsula before the arrival of English-speaking settlers.</p>
<p>One concept features the image of a Spanish galleon and the date 1513 &mdash; the year Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Le?n first landed in what is now Florida.</p>

			<p>Spaniards DID discover Florida. &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; did not! As long as you&rsquo;re going to consider Black Dominicans, black Puerto Ricans and black Cubans as &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;, this makes no sense. </p>
<p>Yes, isn&rsquo;t it funny how these people seem to be so opportunistic about their Spanish heritage when it&rsquo;s convenient? </p>

			<p>Completely ridiculous, if the Spaniards did not, forgive my bluntness, kick their butts they wouldn&rsquo;t even consider themselves &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;.</p>
<p>How weak and pathetic, these people could have been conquered by virtually any European country, from the Poles to the Germans, and if they were today they&rsquo;d be calling them self Teutonic or Slavic but since they were conquered by Spaniards they call themselves Hispanic.  How ridiculous.</p>
<p>It is just as valid, using that logic to create a license plate that said &#8220;Europeans discovered Florida&#8221;.  Lets all forget that when Florida was &#8220;discovered&#8221; it already had people living there.<br>

			<p>Hmmm&hellip;.it sounds like the (brown) Hispanics like to have it both ways. Many of them like to claim pure or nearly pure idigeneous (American), and fantasize kicking out all of the non-(Brown) Hispanics. But now they like to associate with the White conquistadors, to &#8220;show off.&#8221; Although the Puerto Ricans and Cubans are generally much less anti-White than the Mexicans (and most of the other non-Carribeanian Brown Hispanics outside of Chile and Argentina), I am sure it has little to do with celebrating White Heritage (for most of them). </p>
<p>I am a Floridian resident, and even have a White Spanish ancestor (from Spain) from the colonial period. It annoys me when people call the Brown Hispanics &#8220;Spanish.&#8221; </p>

			<p>Juan Ponce de León, a Spanish conquistador, discovered Florida on April 2, 1513. There were indigenous tribes there before that of course but they certainly weren&rsquo;t Mexicans&hellip; lol. </p>
<p>A mexican is a citizen of Mexico which is a state. A state is a political association with effective sovereignty over a geographic area. Hence a Mexican can be one of the white, black, oppressed amero-indians, or whites that have citizenship in Mexico.</p>
<p>Since Mexico didn&rsquo;t actually become Mexico until they declared their independence from Spain in September 16, 1810, it is technically impossible for a Mexican to have discovered Florida before Juan Ponce de León did on April 2, 1513.</p>
<p>The name itself wasn&rsquo;t even decided on until independence from Spain was secured. Afterwards, it was decided that the new country would be named after its capital city, whose original name of foundation was México-Tenochtitlan after the Aztec Mexicas that inhabited the city in pre-Columbus times. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not rocket science to deduce from this that neither Mexicans nor Aztecs discovered Florida but the modern liberals won&rsquo;t even allow what I have shared here into the classroom though it is the historical factual truth for fear it would take away from their politically correct enculturalism design for this country. </p>
<p>Florida was most likely first discovered by roving bands of Siberian Paleo-Indians on their way South (e.g. toward what we call Mexico today) or possibly pre Paleo Indian Clovis most likely on their way South (which opens up the controversial Solutrean hypothesis meaning the Europeans may have actually discovered Florida before the Siberians came to the Americas). In any event, it surely wasn&rsquo;t Mexicans. </p>

			<p>Yes, they are comparing white Spaniards with the likes of Mestizo&rsquo;s. Only thing they forgot is Spain is in Europe. And most of the so-called Hispanics crossing the border are of mostly Indian Mogoloid background not White European.</p>

			<p>Mestizos are not really Hispanics, but they love the title because they think it lends them class.  They further parlay this into a permanent alternative to Latino (another lie) and Chicano (perhaps more fitting).  I read one group of Mestizo Mexicans actually seeming to project this into a kind of inplied genetic relationship with any European nation that uses a Romance - that is, a Latin based language.  When are we going to assert to these dimwits that Latins were white people and Latin is a major Caucasian root language?</p>
<p>Spain was settled by Celti-Iberians before Romans allowed established some settlements.  Then the German Vandals (Andulusia) and Visigoths moved in.  These were the people who gave Spain El Cid.  Spanish is a combination of Latin, Gaelic and an early Germanic tongue.  And it has nothing to do with these little brown people assulting our border and culture.  Nothing except that they were named and converted by their Spanish Conquerors to the point that they don&rsquo;t know who they really are&hellip;.. so they make things up.</p>
<p>What I notice is that indigenous people in North America have a habit of making up history and even connections like this and repeat it enough until they believe it.  If they repeat it enough to a dumbed down American youth, it gains acceptance and another important definition defining white culture and heritage has been destroyed, if not actually stolen.</p>

			<p>Once again the root cause of the Republic&rsquo;s decline is voided into the public domaine. THE critical question is what is an American. Apparently not a naitonality. Because this seems to be so, the general public cannot condemn subversive, divisive, racial expressions such as this. Therefore we continue to be saddled with those who will never have a tenacious desire to maintain the Republic and its immutable moral and governing principles.</p>
<p>For those who ridicule this plate, it is no more inappropriate than those who declare, while claiming to be citizens, that they are Jewish-Americans, Irish-Americans, German-Americans, Polish-Americans, Italian-Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans,<br>
 ad nauseum.</p>

			<p>The term &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; was a creation of the Office of Education during the Carter Administration. The description of its origin is narrated in the article &#8220;The Orgin of the Term &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;, by Grace Flores-Hughes. The article was printed in the Harvard Journal of Hispanic Policy, Volume 18, 2005-2006. The authoress has been appointed by the Texas carpet bagger to a five year term on the Federal Service Impasses Panel. The term expires in 2009.</p>
<p>As commentators have noted, real Spaniards may be offended by the reduction of Ponce de Leon to a mixed blood, stateless  <br>
 commoner. The Catholic Encyclopedia describes him as &#8220;decended from and ancient and noble family&#8221;, which is to say of white,Iberio-Celtic, Visigothic stock.<br>

			<p>A ridiculous claim of course, but one which they understandably wish to make&hellip;seeing as the civilizational accomplishments of the Spanish people are great and manifest and the accomplishments of the &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are pretty much non-existent.  </p>
<p>Perhaps it would be a good idea to revive the Spanish empire&hellip;the hispanics haven&rsquo;t exactly been flourishing since it came to an end.</p>

			<p>The American Indians discovered and occupied Florida about 40 thousand years before Spaniards did.  The Spaniards came to the New World seeking gold, not land nor slaves.  When they discovered that the American Indians lived in the Stone Age and didn&rsquo;t work metals, they moved south to Mexico and beyond where the locals did work gold.  Then as now Hispanics accomplish nothing on their own and live parasitically off of foreign men and women better than themselves&hellip;  </p>

			<p>I hope some Indian, er, excuse me, NATIVE AMERICAN groups protest saying the same things they do about Columbus (&#8220;Columbus didn&rsquo;t discover America. Native Americans were already here!&#8221;). </p>
<p>Works for Hispanics too&hellip; they couldn&rsquo;t have possibly &#8220;discovered&#8221; Florida since people were already living there when Hispanics arrived.  Geez, whatever. </p>

			<p>If you visit some of the areas associated with Conquistadors in Spain, you will find strawberry blondes, freckles, light eyes and skin etc.  Obviously the Vikings!  They knew how to sail those ships hundreds of yeasr before the armadas.  Take a look at the route from Sweden/Norway, Holland, N. France, England.  All sea routes pass Spain on the south.  You&rsquo;ll see the same thing in So. Spain, as the Greeks, etc, sailed out the Mediterranean, many blondes/blue eyed, and mixed with N.Africans. Who were the Conquistadors?  My guess is their names were Lars, Olaf, Sven etc.</p>

Were not ever a Republic anymore because the one we select and elect just spit in our face with almost every action they take. As of now whites still are the majority in the USA but that will soon change, then the bleeding hearts will find our what their weak minded deeds have done to their grandchildren..</p>

			<p>I bet the Spanish goverment heaved a big sigh of relief 1810 to 1830 when all their American colonies revolted and became independent.</p>
<p>Spain got rid of a corrupt, criminal disfunctional burden when it lost Latin America.  No wonder Spain did little or nothing to keep those colonies.</p>

			<p>to Cliff Yablonski:</p>
<p>They could try but it won&rsquo;t work.  The Moors were not Spanish but Islamic invaders.  Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand united Spain and drove them out.  In fact all the Moors (and the Jews) were expelled from Spain in the summer of 1492, before Columbus sailed.  Queen Isabella financed Columbus&rsquo; mission but he was Italian.  Besides, blacks didn&rsquo;t sail anywhere-aren&rsquo;t they afraid of the water? <br>
Btw, the daughter of the Spanish queen and king was Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of Henry the Eighth, the English Tudor king.  She had more Plantagenet blood (English royalty) than he.<br>

			<p>       Gentlemen I truly sympathize with your irritation of the equivocal use of the term &ldquo;Hispanic&rdquo; which allows our little brown friends to claim to be the discovers of Florida  and victims of Spanish imperial oppression at the same time. In the first instance, Hispanic is used in the sense of anyone who is from a Spanish speaking culture. In the second instance its anyone who is non-white from a Spanish speaking culture, especially Mestizos, who are part of cultural Marxism&rsquo;s pantheon of the persecuted. </p>
<p>        However that being said, I am disturbed by the glee of many of you at proclaiming the red Indian&rsquo;s, (not to be confused with the Hindoos!), as the &ldquo;discovers&rdquo; of Florida and America.</p>
<p>      Our Indian friends discovered nothing but what was over the next hill while simultaneously forgetting what was over the last one. They simply nomadicly wandered across the Americas over thousands of years.  They had no clue where they were located in relation to the rest of the world. They never left their tribes&rsquo; home areas to venture thousands of miles in a matter of months, charting, mapping and chronicling what they find then return to their people&rsquo;s territory to make their civilization aware of these far off lands with the ability to return to these places on a regular basis.</p>
<p>         The Europeans actions of exploration &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; these areas so now the whole world, all of the nations of the world, know where these places are. Europeans are the first ones to record all the separate pieces and put them together to make one whole. Europeans in this sense truly discovered<br>
the world.<br>
         <br>
        Also if you read history texts from the 1960&rsquo;s forward you will notice many will criticize the Eurocentric view of history. What to these books is a blight is to me a virtue.</p>
<p>       What these explores did, (Columbus, Leon, Balboa, Soto, Cabot, Hudson, Cartier, Magellan, Gama etc.) was discover these places for THE civilization. The only one that matters, OUR civilization which is European civilization. </p>
<p>      Eurocentrism in history says that we and our family of nations are separate from the rest of the world in some sense. There is an &ldquo;us.&rdquo; Saying &ldquo;the Indians discovered America&rdquo; is saying &ldquo;we&rdquo; as Europeans and Americans never did exist or have ceased to exist. </p>

<p>How can these people now claim that hispanics are responsible for discovering Florida?</p>
<p>As many have noted, it was white Spaniards who discovered Florida. If the discover of Florida is to be celebrated, it should be made clear that white Spaniards are responsible for this great achievement.</p>

			<p>I know at least one full-blooded German who applied for, and got, admission to a well-known research University since her family is from Argentina. Affirmative action is a joke.</p>

			<p>Wait a minute, I thought it was the Indians that discovered North America, of which Florida is part of it.</p>
<p>Maybe ever state should have a plate saying who discovered it. Just off the top of my head, the English discovered Virgina, the Dutch discovered New York, the Russians discovered Alaska, the French discovered most of the states in the Midwest, the Viking discovered Minnesota, and the English, Sir Francis Drake, discovered California and Hawaii. </p>
<p>But that would never fly because they are White</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ok so now I want a plate that lists all white anglo saxon achievements.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a plate would never be permitted because its size would obstruct your vision on all sides of your vehicle and probably protrude from the vehicle to the degree that it would take up more than one traffic lane.</p>
<p>I would like to add that not all White achievements were of Anglo-Saxon origin. Leonardo da Vinci, Enrico Fermi, Francico de Goya, Jonas Salk, Louis Pasteur etc. were not Anglo-Saxon. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I am sure the Seminole indians who had lived in the Everglades for the last few thousand years would be interested to know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought that as well but I was wrong. Check the link below. However, that being said, there were indigenous peoples there before the arrival of the Spanish.</p>

			<p>Saying &#8220;Columbus discovered America&#8221; is a poor way of giving him the real credit for changing history so dramatically. That&rsquo;s why neither Vikings nor Amerinds are given the credit.</p>

			<p>Perhaps Florida needs a more realistic license plate depicting Hispanic&rsquo;s contribution to the state in the way of Mexicans beheading little girls:</p>

			<p>Little do people know that many conquistadors had ruddy complexions with blond and red hair courtesy of their Visigothic ancestors although the Celt-Iberians were known to have some fair characteristics as well.  They did not resemble stumpy brown mexicans that infest most of our major cities as &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221;.  </p>

			<p>Here are other proposed specialty tags:</p>
<p>1.  Civil Rights is For Everyone Not Just Africans, Hispanics, and white Bolsheviks.  Comment.  No, while this is correct it is too long.</p>
<p>2.  Sovereignty or Death.   Comment:  I like it.</p>
<p>3.  Diversity Kills &#8220;E Pluribus Unum&#8221;.  Comment:  Love it.</p>

			<p>Okay, so I do not get to own a tag with the Confederate flag as it is &#8220;offensive&#8221; to blacks. I AM offended by this proposal. I think we should go back to STATE TAGS like we had years ago. </p>
