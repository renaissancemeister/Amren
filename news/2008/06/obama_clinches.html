<h1>Obama Clinches Nomination, Plans Celebration</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack Obama clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday, becoming the first black candidate to lead a major party into a campaign for the White House.</p>
<p>Vanquished rival Hillary Rodham Clinton swiftly signaled an interest in joining the ticket as his running mate.</p>
<p>Obama arranged a victory celebration in St. Paul, Minn., at the site of this summer&rsquo;s Republican National Convention &mdash; an in-your-face gesture to Sen. John McCain, who will be his opponent in the race to become the nation&rsquo;s 44th president.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old Obama outlasted Clinton in a historic campaign that sparked record turnouts in primary after primary, yet exposed deep racial and gender divisions within the party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to one participant in an afternoon conference call among Clinton and members of the New York congressional delegation, Rep. Nydia Velazquez said she believed the best way for Obama to win over Hispanics and members of other key voting blocs would be to take the former first lady as his running mate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am open to it,&#8221; Clinton replied, if it would help the party&rsquo;s prospects in November, said the participant, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the call was a private matter.</p>
<p>Obama sealed his victory based on primary elections, state Democratic caucuses and delegates&rsquo; public declarations as well as support from 22 delegates and &#8220;superdelegates&#8221; who privately confirmed their intentions to The Associated Press. It takes 2,118 delegates to clinch the nomination.</p>
<p>Clinton stood ready to concede that her rival had amassed the delegates needed to triumph, according to officials in her campaign. They stressed that the New York senator did not intend to suspend or end her candidacy in a speech Tuesday night in New York. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to divulge her plans.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s triumph was fashioned on prodigious fundraising, meticulous organizing and his theme of change aimed at an electorate opposed to the Iraq war and worried about the economy &mdash; all harnessed to his own innate gifts as a campaigner.</p>
<p>With her husband&rsquo;s two-White House terms as a backdrop, Clinton campaigned for months as the candidate of experience, a former first lady and second-term senator ready, she said, to take over on Day One.</p>
<p>But after a year on the campaign trail, Obama won the kickoff Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3, and the freshman senator became something of an overnight political phenomenon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came together as Democrats, as Republicans and independents, to stand up and say we are one nation, we are one people and our time for change has come,&#8221; he said that night in Des Moines.</p>
<p>A video produced by Will I. Am and built around Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;Yes, we can&#8221; rallying cry quickly went viral. It drew its one millionth hit within a few days of being posted.</p>

			<p>I could be wrong, but I&rsquo;ve got a feeling there&rsquo;s a Republican operative somewhere with some devastating information on Obama and/or his wife that could well be quite explosive.</p>
<p>Sean Hannity mentioned that somebody is circulating the rumor that there&rsquo;s information that this Michelle referred to white people as &#8220;whities,&#8221; and made other derogatory comments.</p>
<p>But I think there is even worse info to reveal, but it&rsquo;s just a hunch.  Time will tell.</p>

			<p>If this is true:</p>
<p>(1) George Soros has won both party&rsquo;s nominations.  He&rsquo;s behind both McCain and Obama.</p>
<p>(2) Clinton, Inc. wasn&rsquo;t the genius political machine that everyone thought they were.  The only reason they seemed strong is that their opponents were George H.W. Bush (1992), Bob Dole (1996), and the Stupid Party in general (1998-9 impeachment saga).  A minnow is a shark in a tiny pond.</p>

			<p>  The AP tried harder than it normally does to hide its political biases in this story, but its idolizing of Barack Obama leaked through anyway. For instance, notice how the story refers to his &#8220;prodigious fundraising.&#8221; Does anyone think that if a White candidate had raised the tons of money he did, the press would not have been snooping around to find out how that person had broken campaign funding laws to do it (the assumption would have been that they DID break them   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s just a question of finding out how.)</p>
<p>  The press in general, ebullient beyond belief to have a black well positioned to be elected president, has refused to do any real vetting or investigating of Obama   &mdash;   and we&rsquo;ll all pay the price, I fear. When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, a leading feminist famously announced, &#8220;We&rsquo;re all (n-words) now.&#8221; If worse comes to worst in November this year, many of us of the Caucasian persuasion will have occasion to re-word that to, &#8220;We&rsquo;re all Crackers now.&#8221; </p>

			<p>Let the games begin. All those Obama worshippers, prepare to to see the false messiah destroy what was once the greatest society ever created. Those self hating whites shall finally reap the punishment they have long desired, sadly they will not be alone. White America shall no longer be the land of the free, but the land of the oppressed. Punished by those who call us white devils, and their new emancipator.</p>

			<p>Believe it or not, I&rsquo;m actually glad that Obama finally won and that he did it the way he did it.  Clinton voters have become completely alienated.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s much more than that.  Obama is a vile racist and black supremacist.  The lemmings in the democratic party suspect it but have been working overtime with the denial.</p>
<p>Obama has only been partially successful in distancing himself from his rogues gallery of racist, anti-American freaks.  So many people desperately want to believe he isn&rsquo;t like that though.</p>
<p>They are about to be smacked hard in the face by reality.  There is a tape of Michelle Obama saying the same racist stuff that Jeremiah Wright and Father Pfleger got caught saying&hellip;.and worse, much worse.  There might even be her caught saying a racial slur against whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before that tape ends up on Youtube or on TV.  If for no other reason than a vindictive Hillary Clinton getting revenge on Obama for stealing what is rightfully hers.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s candidacy is done before it even began.  The question is, how bad will the fallout be for the rest of the DNC.  How many whites will finally figure out that all black issues, especially ones involving electing officials, are about hatred of whites, and little else.</p>

			<p>Well, I can say this.  I am laughing because Hillary has been a race traitor her entire career.  I can&rsquo;t blame blacks for voting him in, we do vote with those who look like us.</p>
<p>Now, the question is is the US going to become like those cities run by blacks, which are crime ridden, disgusting, such as Detroit.</p>

			<p>The ticket has been set in stone for some time now by the &#8216;powers that be&rsquo;.  All the in-fighting between Obama and Hillary, all the name-calling will all end as a Black man teams up with a Blond-haired White woman to run the country.  He will take on Hillary as his &#8216;White B _ _ _ h&rsquo;.  AH, THE MEDIA&rsquo;S FANTASY COME TRUE AT LAST!!  Obama President.  Hillary Vice-President. </p>
<p>All the relentless photos of the two either side by side (their photos that is) displayed endlessly in newpapers, magazines, on television, news reports, on AOL, MSNBC, etc. has been for a purpose -  and that purpose is to indelibly imprint the image of a White woman together with a Black man on our brains and influence young White girls and White women to date Black men.  It couldn&rsquo;t be more obvious, and now (if elected) the two will be running the country! OHHH! All the rabble-rousing and civil rights protests and riots of the 1960&rsquo;s and beyond are now all worth it.  Is it not so very wonderful?</p>

			<p>If Obama is smart, he will reject Hillary as running mate.  She is, after all, a Clinton and as such she would not hesitate to have him killed in order to advance her own political ambitions.  Doesn&rsquo;t anybody remember how many people &#8220;conveniently&#8221; died when her husband was in office?</p>

			<p>This is truly a sad day for America&hellip;  Actually, I knew it was all over on Super Tuesday when we got stuck with Juan McCain!  I still cannot figure how on earth this back-stabbing traitor won the nomination as he hasn&rsquo;t been getting any support from the Conservative base since&hellip;  But deep down I knew all along that the whole &#8220;election process&#8221; was rigged from the start&hellip;  Just another scam to let the people &#8220;think&#8221; that they still mattered.</p>
<p>Of the three remaining candidates, I thought that Hillary would at least be the lesser of the three evils&hellip;  Perhaps we could &#8220;bend&#8221; her a bit on the amnesty issue&hellip;  But no.  As of today, we are now officially stuck with the two worst possible &#8220;candidates&#8221; - Lying Liberal Juan McCain and Anti-American Marxist Barack Hussein Obama.  </p>
<p>Both of these &#8220;top-runners&#8221; will do their best to dissolve our borders and turn us into a North American Union.  In fact, Barack Obama is already receiving pushes from the Washington Post and other &#8220;establishment types&#8221; to style this &#8220;union&#8221; after the European Union, and we all know here on AmRen how wonderful that experiment has been&hellip;</p>
<p>I have done everything in my power to try and protect America these past two years&hellip;  Polls; Petitions; Surveys; constant Faxes and E-Mails to all sorts of Senators, State Reps, Assembly Members; Donations to Tancredo, American Patrol and other good American causes; etc. but it all seems to no avail.</p>
<p>Common sense and the will of the people just don&rsquo;t mean anything anymore.  We no longer have any kind of representation in the White House.  We no longer live in a democratic society.  Our voices mean absolutely nothing.  And the Hispanic Institute and other Latino groups are now joining forces to boycott CNN against Lou Dobbs as I write.  What little voice we as Americans (or in my case, as a Permanent Resident Alien) have left is on the line.</p>
<p>What a fantastic victory for the global corporations and their bought and paid for globalist elite politicians.  What a tragic loss for the American people.</p>
<p>My spirit is broken today as I&rsquo;m sure that many sensible and patriotic Americans feel as well, but who knows?  Tomorrow&rsquo;s another day&hellip;<br>

			<p>&ldquo;The 46-year-old Obama outlasted Clinton in a historic campaign that sparked record turnouts in primary after primary, yet exposed deep racial and gender divisions within the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How utterly laughable!</p>
<p>If there was anything &ldquo;historic&rdquo; about the Democratic primaries, it was that their &ldquo;collective&rdquo; was violently disrupted by their own worship of bitter anti-American entitlement groups and the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media&rsquo;s willingness to favor the racially oriented groups, over similarly gender based groups. The disgusting gushing and fawning, of the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media fools at Comrade Osama&rsquo;s white &ldquo;vanquished rival Hillary Rodham Clinton,&rdquo; proves this beyond all doubt.  </p>
<p>Comrade Obama is declared &ldquo;the winner,&rdquo; yet Hillary just has won the South Dakota primary with 57% as I write this.</p>
<p>What happens if she wins Montana&rsquo;s primary tonight too?</p>
<p>What happens to pigs like MSNBC&rsquo;S Chris Matthews, who has been squealing quite predictably all night about the &ldquo;first person of color in the Western World&rdquo; to win a major party&rsquo;s nomination before these final two primaries&rsquo; results are even in&hellip;blah, blah, blah, and oink, oink, oink&hellip;.?</p>
<p>Well, there is one advantage for such porkers: they can either continue to coo ecstatic about multiculturalism&rsquo;s and Obama&rsquo;s positives; or wax fanatic over America&rsquo;s and McCain&rsquo;s failures, respectively?</p>
<p>How odd, the media and politicians win again?</p>
<p>Fancy that?</p>
<p>As always and of course, God help us all!</p>

			<p>While watching Obama&rsquo;s speech, I noticed that many people in the audience were extremely fair-haired and fair-complexioned, and they were screaming their hearts out for him. Minnesota, of course, was mostly settled by Scandinavians. I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if liberalism is just part of Scandinavian blood, no matter where they live. </p>
<p>As some posts have mentioned in response to other articles, Eastern and Southern Europeans seem to have a different mindset. I don&rsquo;t think he would attract a big crowd in their neighborhoods.    </p>

<p>Read between the lines with Hillarys comments about Whites. <br>
It&rsquo;s a strategy on the part of the Obama/Clinton &lsquo;08 Campaign. This is what the PC crowd has been waiting for and the moment has arrived. Non-Whites and Women (Non-White friendly, Anti-White Male, Feminists) running things. After all didn&rsquo;t Bill Clinton publicly say that a Non-White America was a good thing and what we needed? This would only fulfill HIS dream. </p>
<p>So she makes this comment to show she cares for us, and we all know she positively does not care for us any more than her husband did. But she DOES have contempt for us, as does Obama.</p>
<p>And THAT would justify the cynicism behind her attempt to identify with us, especially when she knows how desperate we are for some, even a little, Political representation.</p>
<p>No, her comments, following Obamas, was the brain-child of one of them or someone on their Staff, and then plotted out in a meeting room and hatched, like a new born chick, at the right moment, in the right order (first his comment, then hers) to their willing accomplices in the Press. Sheer head to toe Show Business. The Campaign just like something on TV, part Soap Opera, part Sunday morning Political Program, to suit the mentality and intellectual ability of its audience, shallow (the Non-Whites) and pretentious (the &ldquo;Enlightened&rdquo; Whites). Though both share the same features. </p>
<p>No folks, it was just their carefully staged, choreographed attempt, to fool us all by having Obama and Clinton play a bit of &ldquo;Good Cop - Bad Cop&rdquo; to fool us into voting them into Office and thereby participating in our own destruction. Nothign more. Politics is all about favors, and there is NOTHING we&rsquo;re going to get from them in return for our votes. Well, that&rsquo;s not entirely true. We&rsquo;re going to get something, but it won&rsquo;t be a favor. In an uncertain world that is something we can all count on.</p>

<p>Not bad Dedalus. I remember reading this post at the time and being intrigued. But now, I have to say, I&rsquo;m impressed. And not just with the prediction, but the analysis too. It&rsquo;s just all pretty scary as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. Not just WHAT is happening, but HOW it&rsquo;s happening. I think the worst is yet to come.</p>

			<p>If one thinks the dissention over the 2000 elections were contentuous, just wait and see the riots/looting/raping/burning/pillaging/murders and other civil disobedience if Obama is not elected, it will be as bad as if he IS elected.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Obama arranged a victory celebration in St. Paul, Minn., at the site of this summer&rsquo;s Republican National Convention &mdash; an in-your-face gesture to Sen. John McCain, who will be his opponent in the race to become the nation&rsquo;s 44th president.&#8221;</p>
<p>My gut response to reading this was - &#8220;How crude! Both on the part of Obama and the Journalist who wrote the article. Why is an &#8220;in your face gesture&#8221; necessary?  This is the man who is going to &#8220;heal&#8221; us? Why would he do that? Not that I care about McCain. I don&rsquo;t. But it just struck me as yet more arrogant childishness.  </p>
<p>But I have to say this. It&rsquo;s another gut response I have had everytime I see Obama speak on TV. If you look closely enough you can tell, that even HE knows he&rsquo;s a fraud.  I don&rsquo;t think I am imagining things. No, I realize that he is full of himself. But it&rsquo;s the White genes, the guilty conscience. Because Blacks by and large are as Michael Levin said of them, that they are full of themselves and unrepentent ( I believe the quote from Mr. Levin is from a book review by Jared Taylor that you can find here).</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m quite pleased over the victory. The shoe is on the other foot now, so with their guy in Washington they won&rsquo;t have the premises for complaint. I don&rsquo;t think Obama is going to ruin anything anymore than any of the other candidates, so whatever does happen, it&rsquo;s a small price to pay for the fact that the minority is now in charge, and therefore gone are the inherently unquestioned minority status as a victim of white governance. This time, they are victims of ethnic governance, and have to shut up until the next impeachment.<br>

			<p>at the risk of disturbing the conservative consensus here, 2 points:</p>
<p>1) Bush pretty much wrekced the US with no help from Obama: mass immigration, a trillion dollar boo boo in the middle east, the dollar worthless, a huge trade deficit, exported jobs, a vanishing middle class, no action on climate, increased dependency on foregin oil, chaos and corruption on wall street, in hock to China, and most importantly, the US is just NOT taken seriously any longer in the world - trust me, I live abroad.</p>
<p>2) If Americans are disciplined and don&rsquo;t just whine about how their country is being taken over, then they can make Obama the poster boy for the new US consensus on race: </p>
<p>very limited immigration, zero tolerance for crime, individual merit, no quotas, no AA, no more speech codes, no more apologies for past mistakes, no more guilt and defensiveness, and no excuses for blacks or whites who do not behave civilly.</p>
<p>Without all these massive controls, whites are free to rebuild their communitiesand institutuions, as are blacks, and there is room for mixed communtiies as well for anyone who chooses them.</p>
<p>Congratulations! Blacks have arrived! If whites will elect a black president, then discrimination is a thing of the past, and there are no excuses left for failed blacks!!</p>
<p>Another plus:<br>
Obama is less likely to blunder into a another trillion dollar mistake than Mcain.</p>

The sad thing is, this is really just a referendum against Bush&rsquo;s lack of leadership.  The even sadder thing is that in the public perception Bush is associated with the right.</p>
<p></p>
<p>RE: riots   &mdash;   actually, that&rsquo;s an interesting idea.  One wonders if blacks and bleeding-hearts will feel that Obama is &#8220;entitled&#8221; to this election and will raise hell if he loses.</p>

<p>Wrong Wrong Wrong!!!! A vote for mcamnesty continues to allow the strangelhold the 2 party system has on us. mcamnesty will push for amensty/guest workers/etc which will destroy this nation. As an ex-republican I am voting 3rd party this time around. If enough people vote 3rd party, we can break this 2 party stranglehold (both party&rsquo;s are horrific, socialists vs left of center repubs). Maybe not this election but in future elections. At a minimum, if enough conservatives vote 3rd pary the GOP might get a hint (doubt it though). Look into the CONSTITUTION PARTY with Pastor Chuck Baldwin as the candidate. He is vehemently opposed to amnesty and this insane mass immigration of muslims and non whites. At least check it out before you vote &#8220;lesser of 2 evils&#8221; again. If we don&rsquo;t break the 2 party system, we are doomed anyway. Just a matter of how fast (light speed with dems or train with repubs, but the end result is the same).</p>

If Obama loses, look for instantaneous riots by angry black mobs, Win or lose, there will be violence in the streets across America.

<p><b>10 Things To Do Before The Election:</b></p>
<p>1.  Clean your rifle.</p>

<p>3.  Sharpen your knives.</p>
<p>4.  Make sure everyone in your household knows how and when to use the items in  1, 2, and 3 above.</p>
<p>5.  Lay in stocks of water purification supplies, ammo, any required medicines, and food in that order. </p>
<p>6.  Make sure your vehicles&rsquo; gas tanks are always at least half full.</p>
<p>7.  Map out escape routes from the cities to your SAFE area (Selected Area For Evasion). Try to pick routes away from major traffic arteries.</p>
<p>8.  If possible, preposition supplies from #5 at your SAFE area.</p>
<p>9.  Since the trend is to burning property during riots, buy several inexpensive fire extinguishers.</p>
<p>10. KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT about your preparations.</p>

			<p>Barack Obama clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday, becoming the first black candidate to lead a major party into a campaign for the White House&hellip;</p>
<p>Barack Obama was HANDED the nomination!&hellip;he DIDN&rsquo;T win it!&hellip;The FIX was and IS in!&hellip;the puppeteers who pull the strings and REALLY run this country have MADE SURE of it!&hellip;Hillary was NEVER a threat or an honest &#8220;candidate&#8221;&hellip;the missteps she AND her husband took&hellip;the words they DID and DIDN&rsquo;T speak&hellip;were calculated and deliberate to ENSURE she did NOT win!&hellip;her candidacy blocked out anyone who was a SERIOUS CANDIDATE!&hellip;she was CHOSEN to run to give the AMERICAN PEOPLE that they actually had a CHOICE!&hellip;and to make it APPEAR that Obama had actually WON instead of what the TRUTH is&hellip;he was HANDED the ULTIMATE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POSITION sought!&hellip;EVERY thing that has come out about this man, the limited information we have, has shown his RACISM and ANTI-AMERICAN feelings&hellip;and he has been given a FREE PASS!&hellip;his wife is WORSE and SHE has gotten a FREE PASS!&hellip;He HASN&rsquo;T &#8220;CLINCHED&#8221; a thing!</p>
<p>The 46-year-old Obama outlasted Clinton in a historic campaign that sparked record turnouts in primary after primary, yet exposed deep racial and gender divisions within the party&hellip;</p>
<p>He was PROGRAMMED to &#8220;outlast&#8221; her&hellip;the RACIAL DIVISIONS have been ATTRIBUTED to HER and her husband&hellip;yet, the TRUE racist statements have come from the Obama side and his friends, acquaintences and MENTORS!&hellip;while he can boast of winning the African-American vote and can speak of WHITES, and his WHITE GRANDMOTHER, in racist ways, and is NOT held accountable&hellip;SHE was not allowed to speak of having the support of WHITE WORKING CLASS AMERICANS!&hellip;when SHE said that SHE was accused of being the RACIST!&hellip;when the TRUTH was spoken by BILL&hellip;that the RACE CARD was played&hellip;HE was attacked as RACIST!&hellip;when certain individuals spoke the TRUTH&hellip;if it weren&rsquo;t for the color of his skin he would NOT be running for president&hellip;he has no experience, no track record, no voting history&hellip;no one KNOWS what he TRULY stands for!&hellip;if a WHITE MAN with the SAME lack of credentials tried to run, HE would have been advised to wait!&hellip;and if a WHITE MAN had a wife as OBNOXIOUS and IRRITATING and UNATTRACTIVE with such a LACK OF CLASS&hellip;he would be advised to PUT A MUZZLE ON HER!&hellip;she&rsquo;d be sent to ETIQUETTE and LADYLIKE classes!</p>
<p><br>
The former first lady as his running mate&hellip;.&ldquo;I am open to it,&rdquo; Clinton replied&hellip;</p>
<p>While I am NOT and have NEVER BEEN a Clinton supporter&hellip;what the Democrat Party did to her to ENSURE an Obama win&hellip;what the party did to the VOTERS&hellip;the AMERICAN PEOPLE to ENSURE a Barack &#8220;victory&#8221;&hellip;if I were her I would have NO loyalty to this party!&hellip;if I were her I would show my love for the COUNTRY is greater than that of the party and would throw my support and my delegates to either McCain or Barr!&hellip;while the delegates and super delegates may be democrats&hellip;they cannot vote Republican&hellip;but they CAN withhold their support for Obama&hellip;and can VOICE their support for McCain or Barr&hellip;and WITHDRAW in a PUBLIC WAY from the Democrats!&hellip;for the love of this COUNTRY!</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;We came together as Democrats, as Republicans and independents, to stand up and say we are one nation, we are one people and our time for change has come,&rdquo; he said that night in Des Moines&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just IT&hellip;the CHANGE that&rsquo;s coming our way!&hellip;all WHITES better beware!&hellip;if you think the ENTITLEMENT that the BLACKS believe they have is out of control&hellip;just wait!&hellip;and IF he doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;win&#8221;?&hellip;there will be rioting and burning and black on white violence&hellip;and so my advice would be to prepare and to lock and load!</p>
<p>The REAL SHOW is about to begin&hellip;to see how McCain will MISSTEP and MISSPEAK to ENSURE an Obama win!&hellip;the fact that McCain got the nomination because of the VYABLE and WINABLE candidates dropping out of the nomination process and handing their support to him is very SUSPECT!&hellip;the SAME puppeteers are pulling the strings on THAT end also!&hellip;they ENSURED that McCain, an old, sick, liberal and UNWINNABLE candidate was put in to give the IMPRESSION that when Obama is PUT INTO POWER&hellip;he actually RAN and WON the election!&hellip;as if it was NOT designed!</p>
<p>OUR electorate and Constitutional process has been HIJACKED, sabotaged and taken out of the hands and control of the AMERICAN PEOPLE!&hellip;the AMERICAN VOTER!&hellip;the question that remains and all AMERICANS must ask themselves is this&hellip;&#8221;Who are the puppeteers pulling the strings and what are their intentions&#8221;?!!!</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s been almost one year since Obama&rsquo;s run for the presidency really began to be noticed.  Up until then, all of us&hellip;white/black&hellip;conservative/liberal&hellip;felt that Clinton would be the Democratic nominee.  That was a forgone conclusion.  A year ago, I was already anxious about her potentially becoming the next president because I just didn&rsquo;t see a viable Republican (conservative) candidate on the horizon.  Besides, Bush has screwed up so much in his 8 years that it goes without saying that even Republicans are ready for a change.  That is why I fully expected Clinton to become the next president.  I just decided that I&rsquo;d grit my teeth and deal with her for four years since I was certain that she&rsquo;d make enough people mad that she wouldn&rsquo;t get re-elected for a second term.  A year ago, I never would&rsquo;ve thought that Obama would actually wind up as the nominee.  I have to say that as much as I didn&rsquo;t like the thoughts of &#8220;the other&#8221; Clinton presidency, I am literally terrified of an Obama presidency.  What is wrong with so many people in this country?  Obama is a racist.  He has ties to the Nation of Islam.  His dad was a Muslim, as is his brother.  He has also been trained in that tradition, and I believe that he&rsquo;s still a closet Muslim.  As for his version &#8220;Christianity&#8221;, he ascribes to Afrocentric beliefs.  His wife is allegedly out there ranting on about &#8220;whitey&#8221;, and she&rsquo;s definitely said other controversial things in his run to become the nominee.  What is this guy made of&hellip;Teflon?  Nothing sticks to him!  When I see the many white faces in the crowds of everywhere he gives a speech, I just cringe.  There&rsquo;s no excuse for it&hellip;especially after the stuff that &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Wright has said.  People keep saying that Obama is &#8220;new and refreshingly not so political&#8221; or that &#8220;he stands for change&#8221;.  If you want to know what Obama stands for, then all you have to do is take a good look at his mentor and the  many other controversial people who he has always surrounded himself with.  Are Americans really this stupid?  Are we?  To come ever so close to electing a closet Muslim, white-hating, black guy to become the next leader of the free world only 7 years since Muslims killed 3,000 people on American soil?  It defies all logic.</p>
<p>Oh&hellip;one last thing&hellip;concerning the potential for riots if he doesn&rsquo;t win.  About 6 months ago, my husband and I were discussing the fact that riots could erupt if he ultimately loses in his bid for the presidency.  Since we live in the South, we are a bit more apprehensive about the possibility of rioting.  Obviously, due to where we live, we have a substantially large black population.  Just in going about our daily lives, we tend to over-hear blacks talking about Obama from time to time.  It&rsquo;s very obvious that to most of them they believe he&rsquo;s the second coming.  I overhead one of them tell a black bag boy at a local grocery store that if Obama becomes president, then he (the bag boy) will probably start earning $30,000 or more a year.  The lady was all happy and giddy with just the anticipation of Obama  becoming president.  We&rsquo;ve even overheard one say that Obama will &#8220;stick it to whitey&#8221;.  There&rsquo;s definitely a lot of hope on the part of blacks out there.  Obama is, for all intents and purposes, their messiah.  Yeah, there&rsquo;ll definitely be rioting in the streets of America if he loses.  I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be confined to the inner city either.  That&rsquo;s the scary part.  </p>
<p>Sorry this is so long&hellip;just had to vent.      </p>

After all the media attention this man has received, I have no clue how he stands on one issue.  He talks nonsense, like most blacks, and he will rule like a black&hellip;PURE NONSENCE.</p>

<p>In the Sean Hannity interview of Rev. Jeremiah Wright in March 2007, every time Hannity tried to ask Wright a question, Wright insisted that Hannity could not even have a discussion with him until he had read the books on Black Liberation Theology by Dr. James Cone. <br>
<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=zUdjhKbImwE." rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=zUdjhKbImwE.</a> </p>
<p>Cone&rsquo;s two most famous books are: <br>
·	Black Theology and Black Power, 1969, 160 pp. <br>
·	Black Theology of Liberation, 1970, 214 pp. <br>
 (Amazon has a service that allows customers to digitally search inside some books. Just enter the page numbers below, and it will bring up the quotes.) </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the core beliefs of Black Liberation Theology that Dr. James Cone taught to Rev. Wright, and that Rev. Wright taught to Barack Obama for 20 years as his spiritual advisor. Once Obama knew that Wright&rsquo;s core beliefs were based on the teachings of Dr. Cone, surely he would have read Cone&rsquo;s two most famous books. Although most articles attribute Cone&rsquo;s inflammatory quotes to the first and most famous book, they are actually in the second book. <br>
 <br>
A BLACK THEOLOGY OF LIBERATION</p>
<p>p.27. Black theology refuses to accept a God who is not identified totally with the goals of the black community. If God is not for us, if God is not against white racists, then God is a murderer, and we had better kill God. The task of black theology is to kill gods that do not belong to the black community. </p>
<p>p.59. That the God language of white religion has been used to create a docile spirit among blacks so that whites could aggressively attack them is beyond question. But that does not mean that we cannot kill the white God, so that the presence of the black God can become known in the black-white encounter. The white God is an idol created by racists, and we blacks must perform the iconoclastic task of smashing false images. </p>
<p>p. 111. What need have we for a white Jesus when we are not white but black? If Jesus Christ is white and not black, he is an oppressor, and we must kill him. The appearance of black theology means that the black community is now ready to do something about the white Jesus, so that he cannot get in the way of our revolution. </p>
<p>Barack Obama may be a Christian, but of a kind that few Americans have heard of. Or he may not believe a word of the above nonsense, and is just posing when he tells America he is a Christian. (Has anybody noticed if he has his fingers crossed behind his back when he says that?) Regardless of whether he believes that rabid racial nonsense, or it is just a pose to get elected, does America need a president that delusional or duplicitous? </p>
<p>A question: If American blacks are so oppressed by whites, why are so many foreign blacks desperately trying to get here? Obama, Michelle, Wright, and Cone can&rsquo;t seem to figure that out.    </p>

			<p>To add to my post above:</p>
<p>(3)  Pat Buchanan said earlier in the year that Democrat Party superdelegates are not the kind of people that like to ride to the Alamo.  In other words, they wouldn&rsquo;t cause contention by taking the nomination away from the candidate who got the most delegates from primaries and caucuses, even if it wasn&rsquo;t enough by itself to win the nomination.  Perhaps this news demonstrates.</p>

			<p>     The comments by &#8216;Question Diversity&rsquo; hit the nail right on the head. We are no longer masters of our fate. Do you think that it&rsquo;s a coincidence that Europe and the United States are going through some pretty rocky times? This is a plot to weaken the western free nations so that we no longer trust our leaders and will turn to dictators to solve our problems. Once this happens, you can say &#8216;good-bye&rsquo; to individual freedoms. Welcome to the One World government. The so-called oil crisis, illegal immigration, and Moslem extremism are just a smokescreen. Our leaders don&rsquo;t want to solve these problems. They want them to get worse until we scream for a strongman to save us. The people in the Oval Office and in Congress are not stupid. They are deliberately leading us down the path to destruction. After the world government takes over they will be tossed a few crumbs to keep them quiet while the rest of us mind numbed robots march in step to the altar of socialism and anonymity. </p>

			<p>A few things to consider if Obama becomes President:  </p>
<p>(1)  If, Heaven forbid, a lunatic assassinates him while he is in office, Obama would be celebrated as another bigger-than-life black martyr hero, like Martin Luther King.  To appease the angry blacks, a huge statue of him would be built in Washington and we would never hear the end of what a great man he was.  </p>
<p>(2)  He might decide to let in, say, 500,000 to 1,000,000 Kenyan asylum seekers a year.  After all, they are in civil strife over there and he identifies with his African side, so what is to stop him? </p>
<p>(3)  His wife Michelle is quite hostile to whites.  Maybe this doesn&rsquo;t bother you, but it bothers me.</p>
<p>(4)  America will be going down a new road it has never traveled before.  Will our country&rsquo;s culture become more Afro-centric and less European?  (After all, if we had a Mexican-American President, would it be surprising if our country became more Mexicanized?)</p>
<p>(5)  How will having a black President and black Cabinet affect our country in international relations?  I think it will help us when we deal with Africa or the Caribbean islands, but what about other regions?</p>
<p>(6)  You have to understand that no matter what do for non-whites, some of them will never like us.  In large part it is because of jealousy.  White people everywhere are losing their countries to non-whites.  Having a non-white President will just accelerate our decline.</p>

			<p>Its so fitting that this has happened to Hillary Clinton. She and her hubby, good &#8216;ol slick Willy, have spent their whole lives selling out their fellow Whites to blacks. Now let them have a full taste of their own medicine. What goes around comes around. Clinton&rsquo;s first BIG MISTAKE was in thinking she would take a large share of the black vote. Like any good liberal she could not bring herself to accept an obvious truth, that blacks would put their race first and vote tribally. Partly because of this, she didn&rsquo;t take Obama seriously enough in the beginning. </p>

			<p>John McCain is superior to these wretched posturing phonies in every conceivable way. Its one thing be a man of principal that makes mistakes such as McCain is, its another to be a hollow media image with no achievments, no substance, nothing but slick sound byte emptiness, and a willingness to pander to the lowest levels of society in order to get elected.<br>

			<p>If you think that American whites have been the victim of systematic violence and abuse under the white liberal race traitors, just wait until Obama is sworn in as president.  When that happens, we will have the entire executive branch of the general government systematically targeting whites with all of its power(which is quite considerable thanks to our current leader in the white house).<br>
I suggest, thinking very seriously about obtaining a second passport if you do not already have one.</p>

			<p>I only partially understand the game plan of the liberal agenda.  It&rsquo;s about forming alliances with disaffected groups; homosexuals, feminists, the poor, blacks, etc. against the mainstream majority.  I have a question I&rsquo;d like some liberal on here to answer.  When the nonwhite Democrats exceed the White ones and the political concerns move more and more towards the nonwhite elements of the party, won&rsquo;t you end up being marginalized?  How are the White Democratic politicians who look after your issues going to stay in power?  Hillary Clinton is proof that no one, even the elite, will be immune.</p>

			<p>Would Senator Obama have the nomination now if the truth about his unsavory relationships had surfaced sooner? Would women still be fainting in his presence. Would Jewish liberals still be groveling at his feet? It is patently obvious that in order to assuage white women Senator Clinton will have to be on the ticket. </p>
<p>That said, Senator Clinton is in an awkward position - if she runs as Vice President and he wins then in four years she may well be either too old or too identified with the failed policies of President Obama. If she doesn&rsquo;t run then the African - Americans  will hold her accountable for Senator Obama&rsquo;s loss. </p>
<p>Senator Clinton must give the appearance of supporting the ticket, while being turned down by Senator Obama for Vice President, and then let  Mr. Carville do what he is famous for - <br>
after Obama has been defeated Senator McCain will have to prove to be a disaster. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Senator Clinton may well take the fight to the convention, since she has the popular vote along with the states necessary to win the general election - plus she has gotten stronger at the end while Senator Obama has proven to be what one would expect from the product of affirmative action.</p>
<p>Hmm - no wonder Senator Clinton is carefully weighing her options.   </p>

			<p>&ldquo;Vanquished rival Hillary Rodham Clinton swiftly signaled an interest in joining the ticket as his running mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton is and always has been, a vile Red gorgon.</p>
<p>Just now, it is reported that the Wicked Witch of Multi Cultism will suspend her campaign and endorse the audaciously hopeful mulatto this Friday.</p>
<p>Given all that as happened; given the machinations of the Democratic Party operatives to reduce the Michigan and Florida delegations; given that 23 supporters/superdelegates demanded she back him (chief among them black Congressparasite, Charlie Rangle) today; and the disgusting behavior of the media, she should show some spine and refuse to do so. She should renounce her membership in the Democratic Party and join Senator Joe Lieberman in the ranks of the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; independents in the US Senate.</p>
<p>Then, she should give a raspberry to the whole accursed bunch of them and announce that she will also be running as an independent &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; in the 2008 general election, for the Presidency of the United States. Or in other words, laugh at Comrade Pelosi and the other girls in the Democratic Party and let it be known that she will, with bold optimism, scorch the political landscape for Comrade &ldquo;to be&rdquo; General Secretary BO. She should then unload with her patented shrillness, the litany of: anti-white proclivities, un-American fanatacism, and outright incompetence, that this worthless parvenu brings as his chief  attributes to the table.</p>
<p>She should, but she won&rsquo;t!</p>

			<p>With the blacks this was all about race. A half black in office was better than none. I personally know whites that supported Obama. I view them as race traitors and will no longer associate with them. The white race has been dumbed down by the infiltration into our social institutions by minorities. Year after year scholastic goals had to be lowered to facilitate their access and movement through these institutions. In a generation the United States will be like the former Rhodesia now Zimbabwe or S. Africa which were testaments of the ingenuity and preservence of the white Afrikaners. Today these people are all but extinct due to the white liberals in their in their own governments. Now the dogs of war have been unleashed in these same countries where blacks make a pitiful attempt at self rule while commiting unspeakable acts of brutality upon each other.</p>

			<p> The powers that be are pushing Obama because he is half African and we desperately need African resources to come online to maintain the infinite growth game. Western companies are getting no where in Africa because of corruption and the obvious hatred of Whites, what with the years of slavery thing. A President Obama would return to Africa as a King, he already has drawn large crowds while touring the continent. </p>
<p> China is doing very well at securing resource contracts in Africa while Western companies are besieged with corrupt officials and violence from local gangs. I am not saying this is a good idea, just saying that things are getting pretty desperate.</p>

			<p>I agreed with Hillary Clinton on some things and disagreed with her on others.  I registered and voted for her in the primaries because she wasn&rsquo;t Obama.  He is just too cozy with the kind of people who hate me, and I hate them right back.  </p>
<p>If John McCain has any sense, now is the time to appeal to Clinton&rsquo;s supporters.  A friend who told me about this message board and doesn&rsquo;t come here anymore herself says that what went down at the polls in states with many poor white people was basically a white riot.  She was laughing at the time, but there is truth in that statement.  </p>
<p>I am planning to vote for McCain.  Again it is not because I love everything about him because I don&rsquo;t.  It is because he is not Obama.  My friend calls him &#8220;that racial arsonist.&#8221;  Good term for him.   </p>

<p>Until now we&rsquo;ve never really seen the true face of the cosmopolitan neoliberal system they&rsquo;ve been trying to install for the last sixty years. </p>
<p>Watching the TV coverage of the primaries, I was shocked by how blatant the pro-diversity, race-mixing, equalitarian propaganda has become. </p>
<p>It was like taking a trip to Cuba and watching one of their ridiculous state-run TV stations salivate over Fidel Castro.</p>
<p>Obama has added some much needed proportion to our political picture. </p>
<p>From now on the anti-white policies of our government are going to much harder to conceal.</p>

			<p>This past January, I was hoping that Bill Richardson would win the Democrat nomination and that Ron Paul would win the Republican nomination.</p>
<p>Then I would have wanted Ron Paul to win the Presidency in November.</p>
<p>As much as I did not vote for Barack Obama when the Primary came to my state of Pennsylvania, I still would not want for some lunatic to assassinate him if he becomes President.  It would be a far worse fate for America if that were to happen, then having him complete one, or two terms, as President.</p>
<p>If Obama were murdered these are least some of the disasters<br>
that would occur:</p>
<p>1) Anti-white racism would be further ignited among blacks, because many blacks would be racist enough to blame all whites for the murder, even against sincere white people who used to be Obama&rsquo;s fervent supporters.  Violent attacks against white people would skyrocket!</p>
<p>2) Race riots would break out in Philadelphia, New York, and other major American cities.</p>
<p>3) It would be a disaster for the NRA and the rights of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms.  The anti-gun fanatics would also be infuriated like black people, and would even be in a lot more of a rage to ban all firearms.  Believe me, all you hunters reading this post, the anti-gun people want also want to take away your rifles and shotguns, not just handguns and assault weapons!  The anti-gun people have a bigoted mind-set to blame all firearms for crime and murder.</p>
<p>As much as I did not like George W. Bush as President, when he leaves office, as required to do so under the Constitution, I will miss the fun of yelling at protest rallies &#8220;George Bush, kiss my Tush!&#8221;</p>

<p>Billary figured it out a little too late.  Where were we in her thoughts 15 years ago?</p>
<p>Our Presidential candidates have the right to grovel to us.  If they give up this right, they can go back to the Senate, an office already above their deserved station.  I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t serve in a Senate that would have Teddy Kennedy.</p>

			<p>Several observations:</p>
<p>1) Liberals needed a half-black to embrace as their ideal &#8220;race trumps gender&#8221; anointed candidate.  100% black would have been &#8220;too black&#8221; for them.  But Obama makes them feel &#8220;safe&#8221; in their diversity celebration.</p>
<p>2) Ann Coulter&rsquo;s current article is exactly right.  She points out how up in arms liberals were about Bush defeating Gore, because &#8220;Gore got more of the popular vote&#8221; - which is irrelevant to choosing the president, but not to selecting a party candidate.  Now that Hillary has received more of the Democratic primary popular vote, what do they say?  That she has been &#8220;vanquished&#8221; and should step aside.</p>
<p>3) An important but ignored point, with regard to the August nominating convention, is that almost undoubtedly Hillary would soundly defeat Obama, were all Democratic primaries re-voted today, because people now have a better appreciation for who Obama is.  It was easier to dupe them a few months ago.</p>
<p>4) The Democratic primary has shown that, for black women, race has overwhelmingly trumped gender, whereas for many white women, gender has trumped race.</p>
<p>5) As for a general election between Obama and McCain (double yuck!):  If 95% of black women can vote for a half-black man without being called racist, then can 95% of white men NOT vote for that same half-white man without being called racist?!</p>

<p>Although this is undoubtably true, I&rsquo;d also add that this is expedient to them in another way, viz., they want the future of the United States to be mongrelized. This is also why &#8216;Tiger&rsquo; Woods is such a boon to their cause. He is a mixture of several races and is the poster image of what they desire this country and all the West to become.</p>

     Here is what you should do. Never blog again on AMREN or any other source not endorsed by Morris Dees and Hand Gun Control Inc. Do not purchase a weapon if you have to fill out a Federal Firearm transfer form. If you have a carry permit, surrender it at once. Purchase Obama`s book, &#8221; The Audacity of Hope,&#8221; at Waldon Books and be sure to use a credit card. Donate 25 dollars to the National Democratic Party. Clear off all right wing sites from your favorites page on your computor. Oil and cosmolize all your fire arms and find a safe unknown place to entrench them.<br>
     Write a letter to the editor about how you feel empowered and free from past bigotries by Obama`s nomination. Get the Hell off their radar before all you care about including your very life becomes the property of somebody else. The republicans have made certain they will lose in November. Obama may very well be the last elected president of the country. No Roman would ever have dreamed that the republc they loved and fought for would be destroyed by those that cared more for order than liberty. After Julius Caesar was made dictator for life, Rome descended into tryanny, a trip that took 500 years. Our`s may very well take 500 days or less.<br>

			<p>The central issue is not the fact that Senator Clinton has won the popular vote, not the fact that she has gotten stronger as the campaign came to an end, nor the fact that she is better qualified in virtually every way than her opponent, and certainly not the fact that she would, by far have the best chance of being elected; but rather the fact that her opponent is an affirmative action African - American (with an absolute free pass by the mainstream press). </p>
<p>Senator Obama makes egg head liberals feel smugly superior while simultaneously serving to &#8220;balm&#8221; over their perceived white guilt. Collectively, they act as if to say, look at me, I&rsquo;m young, smart, hip, and liberal. When asked to name one thing that Senator Obama has ever done that even remotely indicates an achievement, they answer in unison and with the standard party line: &#8220;he wants change and so do I&#8221;.       </p>
<p>When all else is said and done I would prefer a Bush Three than a Carter Two.</p>

			<p>Obama doesn&rsquo;t have the nomination until they vote on it at the convention in August.  What&rsquo;s wrong with the Democrat Pary?  They had this thing sewn up hands down until Obama came along.  I was perfectly willing to sit out the election along with alot of other conservatives and let the dragon lady win.  The whole dynamic of this race has changed for me now and I&rsquo;m going to have to cast a vote for that neocon Bush clone now. I&rsquo;m hearing alot of news on the MSM from the RNC who expects a third of Democrats to vote for McCain now.  I&rsquo;m hearing alot of angry women saying their going to get even by sabotaging the election.  Putting Clinton on the VP ticket won&rsquo;t help that much either because alot of voters aren&rsquo;t going to vote for a black guy anyhow.  If they nominate him they&rsquo;re shooting themselves in the foot.   </p>

			<p>The blacks and their smattering of white allied indoctronated gen-xers combined still lack the numbers to defeat McCain.  The only &#8220;change&#8221; this grinning idiot has to offer is the fact that he is the first black to win a primary.  Sorry dude, but that hardly makes you presidential material&hellip;</p>

			<p>Look into the CONSTITUTION PARTY with Pastor Chuck Baldwin as the candidate. He is vehemently opposed to amnesty and this insane mass immigration of muslims and non whites. At least check it out before you vote &ldquo;lesser of 2 evils&rdquo; again. If we don&rsquo;t break the 2 party system, we are doomed anyway. Just a matter of how fast (light speed with dems or train with repubs, but the end result is the same).</p>

<p>I was thinking about Baldwin yesterday.  I miss his articles on VDARE, and I am a Secular and Independent. The basic message I get from his articles is that Christianity today is top heavy with people who are, well, superfical and conformist.  More interested in courting celebrity and making money than in following the principles of their theology.  Impossible to argue with him there.  That would explain why Christians know how Bono is and have no idea who Solzhenitsyn, one of the most important public figures of the 20th century, let alone arguably the most important Christian. And what he&rsquo;s done, ie; Stand up to a corrupt power system, go to jail for his efforts, survive, come out more focused on his spiritual life then any personal resentment (which in itself should be more than enough) but, perhaps most importantly for us, DOCUMENTED his experiences!</p>
<p>And I am sympathetic to this poster too, but the whole system would have to break down for us to challenge the two party system. I think that what a lot of us are trying to do is keep a building standing that is already crumbling to the ground.  Time to get out of its way and work on an alternative.  Same goes for the Universities.</p>

			<p>Blacks would have gotten nowhere were it not for tying themselves to big sister- the white feminist- it would be nice to see this alliance break.</p>

			<p>It will be interesting to see who Barack will owe once he is elected.  Like Bill Clinton owed Pamela Harriman et al.</p>
<p>The people he will promote will be his biggest backers behind the election (Ambassadorships, Department Secretaries, etc.).<br>
