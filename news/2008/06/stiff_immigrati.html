<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The Swiss media was unanimous on Monday in saying that Switzerland&rsquo;s biggest political party, the rightwing People&rsquo;s Party, had taken a beating at the polls.</p>
<p>Most editorialists agreed that the self-designated opposition party had come undone after voters rejected three proposals it had backed, including reintroducing the ballot box for naturalisation procedures.</p>
<p>For Zurich&rsquo;s Neue Zürcher Zeitung, voters gave the People&rsquo;s Party a lesson it shouldn&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not the fact that they lost that should make them think, but rather how, especially for a party that claims to know what the people wants,&#8221; it wrote.</p>
<p>For the NZZ, by making criminals out of foreigners who want to become Swiss, the People&rsquo;s Party also underestimated voters&rsquo; capacity to reach a sober, unemotional decision.</p>
<p>For Lausanne&rsquo;s 24 Heures, the votes were a sign of political maturity, while for Fribourg&rsquo;s La Liberté they showed that voters had the wisdom that the People&rsquo;s Party so often like to call upon.</p>
<p>For Zürich&rsquo;s Tages Anzeiger, it was clear that most voters were fed up with the rightwing party&rsquo;s radical approach, which it said did not reflect Swiss reality and people&rsquo;s everyday lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;With its campaign .&nbsp;.&nbsp;., the People&rsquo;s Party challenged a majority of voters who want to see the return of one of the virtues of Swiss politics: the desire and the capacity to find compromises,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Lucerne&rsquo;s Neue Luzerner Zeitung sees Sunday&rsquo;s vote as a turnaround. &#8220;Voters inflicted a Waterloo on the country&rsquo;s most successful party for the past few years, betraying a political change of mood,&#8221; it wrote.</p>
<p>Geneva&rsquo;s Le Temps agreed, saying that it was more than a defeat, but also a warning. &#8220;This does not mean the party will collapse, but it will leave some traces in the veins of this monolithic structure,&#8221; it noted.</p>
<p><b>Spanking</b></p>
<p>Zurich tabloid Blick, the country&rsquo;s biggest selling newspaper, said that Sunday&rsquo;s vote was a &#8220;spanking&#8221; for the party&rsquo;s figurehead, the former justice minister and billionaire Christoph Blocher.</p>
<p>Blocher, it said, put his own money on the line to support the campaign ahead of the vote, in an attempt to avenge his eviction from the government by parliament last December.</p>
<p>The Berner Zeitung picked up on the same theme, pointing out that defeat must have been particularly painful for Blocher. &#8220;It looks like he has already passed his zenith,&#8221; it wrote.</p>
<p>The party&rsquo;s decision to proclaim that it was in the opposition after Blocher&rsquo;s eviction seems to have backfired according to commentators.</p>
<p>For 24 Heures, the warning the People&rsquo;s Party has received was directly related to this choice. What it lacks, it said, is a coherent political programme with proposals that can bring together a majority of voters.</p>
<p>However, nobody considers the rightwing party down and out for the count.</p>
<p>For the NZZ, beating two ballots announced by the People&rsquo;s Party against the extension of a free movement of peoples accord with the European Union will be much harder. &#8220;The result promises to be much tighter,&#8221; it wrote.</p>
<p>And for Bern&rsquo;s Bund, foreigners will remain the party&rsquo;s core political theme and its best card to attract voters. Issues such as asylum or gypsies will guarantee the party some future success.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the details of this referendum, but I&rsquo;m guessing that the proposal was blocked due to the large number of Germans, French, Italians etc who live in Switzerland and don&rsquo;t want to prevent their relatives getting citizenship. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the Swiss want their country flooded with third-world immigrants.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know alot about Switzerland but I do know that something has drastically gone wrong here in America. The very possibility of us having Obama as president turns my stomach. And if in fact he is elected, this will divide this country like nothing we have seen before. Rap and Wright in the Whitehouse? White America is pretty much screwed and in a generation we may look like Zimbabwe or S. Africa.</p>

<p>The problem is the Swiss don&rsquo;t have enough diversity yet. People who are not around a lot of diversity tend to be sheltered and naive. Take the Swiss and send them to any inner-city in America where they can experience up close and personal lots of diversity. Tell them this is your future. THEN they&rsquo;d come around.</p>

			<p>Kind of like in America, they always try and march out a few Irish illegals who just want to make a better life.</p>
<p>And many Americans have Irish heritage (legal immigrants mind you) so they try and get us to cave in - funny enough with an appeal to people with whom we share a natural genetic and racial link.</p>
<p>Of course, there are only a few thousand Irish illegals - and something like 15-30 million hispanic illegals&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the swiss were not casting a vote for more 3rd world poverty, violence, ignorance, and behaviors.</p>

			<p>20 years from now, when Switzerland&rsquo;s cities are no longer safe, when they have a huge black/Asian underclass, when their once beautiful countryside is littered with rubbish and when the rape of Swiss women and girls becomes commonplace - few Swiss will connect the dots.  They will blame their problems on white racism, poverty, inequality and segregation.  They will live in fear, longing for what once was, as they&rsquo;re fed one lie after another.  Meanwhile the leftist elite, sitting securely within their gated mansions, will laugh an evil laugh.  &#8220;Mission accomplished&#8221; they will say.</p>

			<p>What were they thinking? They don&rsquo;t even have any cotton to pick. Maybe they were overcome by recreational drug use. So much for the Swiss. What is America&rsquo;s excuse, manic depression, insanity, self loathing, or just hell bent on self destruction? Seems like there are getting to be a lot of countries being run by radical marxists, looks like we may be next. Watch for the freedom robbing presidential directives, coming to the country you live in. The three most feared words in America &#8220;THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT&#8221;. </p>

			<p>At least give the Swiss credit for allowing a referendum.  Most countries just pass laws regardless of what the people actually want.  However the Swiss had an opportunity to vote in a truly democratic fashion, unlike many so called democracies.  A referendum insures that there can be no doubt that this is what the people wanted.<br>

<p>This is the basic problem; the idea that being Swiss, French, German, British, Dannish, Polish, etc., is just a matter of filling out an application.  If they hadn&rsquo;t made this major jump in logic they would not be able to claim that they were making criminals out of these people  They might be able to visit, even work for a while, but become Swiss?  They pretend that there is no Swiss identity, no racial or cultural foundation.</p>

<p>Yellowman, the Swiss have being implementing their laws and policies via referendum for decades so this is not a recent development with them. ROFL.</p>
<p>Referendums involve voting as with any election procedure.  Now, what makes you think the outcome of a referendum can never be forged as can any election?  </p>
<p>In such a instance, the outcome would most defni<i>tutely</i> not be a reflection of the will of the people.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you agree?</p>

Exactly.  Whiteplight has said it well.  It&rsquo;s the whole modern notion of a <i>&#8220;Proposition Nation&#8221; </i>  that is being spread from America to other  white countries. It&rsquo;s the notion that nationality is nothing more than a ZIP code or street address. And a country is nothing more than a large apartment house, with constantly changing tenants, and no sense of identity or loyalty.</p>
<p>We seem to be, alas, the center of the infection, although it is not entirely our own fault.  The very concept of national (and even worse, racial) identity is being attacked by those who would like to level us and &#8220;equalize&#8221; us all into one muddy mass of indistinguishable humanity: the Marxists&rsquo; vision of paradise, the rightists&rsquo; vison of hell.</p>

			<p>The modern, trendy notion of a &ldquo;Proposition Nation&rdquo;  that  has been fed to us is now being spread from America to all other white countries.  It should be noted that along with pluralism and multiculturalism, it is not bad or harmful for everyone. It all depends on <i>what&rsquo;s good for whom.</i> Some are served quite well.</p>
<p>In fact,  the notion that nationality is little more than a ZIP code or street address, and that a country is nothing more than a large apartment house with constantly changing tenants,  actually serves the needs and purposes of transients quite well.</p>
<p>If you were a transient, always on the move, this would be a perfect arrangement for you. And so, just as individuals can be transients, there are some populations that are transients too.  Maybe not every generation, but never staying too long in one place, always on the move, nonetheless.</p>
<p>Thus, some are harmed, but others are served. It all depends whose ox is being gored.  Essentially, the question becomes: &#8220;Is it good for the Transients?&#8221;</p>
