<h1><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/education/2004450677_reseg01m.html">The Resegregation of Seattle&rsquo;s Schools</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linda Shaw, Seattle Times, June 1, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly three decades after Seattle Public Schools integrated almost all its schools through busing, that racial balance is long gone.</p>
<p>Leschi Elementary, about evenly divided between white and minority students in 1980, has a nearly all-minority population once again. The same is true for Brighton Elementary, Dunlap Elementary, Van Asselt Elementary &mdash; and all but two of the 26 schools that, the year before busing started, were considered racially imbalanced. Today, a total of 30 schools &mdash; close to a third of the district&rsquo;s buildings &mdash; have nonwhite populations that far exceed the district&rsquo;s average of 58 percent. In 20 of them, nonwhite enrollment is 90 percent or more.</p>
<p>Seattle schools don&rsquo;t look exactly like they did before districtwide busing began in 1978. There are fewer nearly all-white schools. Minority students are not as concentrated as they once were in the central part of the city.</p>
<p>But Seattle Public Schools, like many districts across the nation, has slowly, steadily resegregated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The segregation is often the byproduct of who lives where. But other schools end up that way through the choices parents make.</p>
<p>The Seattle School Board is weighing what, if anything, to do about the situation. As the board plans a major overhaul of how it assigns students to schools, its members face conflicting desires.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The board is more limited than ever in what it can do, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s closely watched desegregation decision a year ago. The court ruled that Seattle and Jefferson County Public Schools in Kentucky could no longer use a student&rsquo;s race in deciding where some students attend school.</p>
<p>Seattle School Board members may face pressure to do something. If they don&rsquo;t, said James Kelly, president and CEO of the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle, he&rsquo;ll recommend that the league&rsquo;s board of directors take legal action.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Busing worked on paper</b></p>
<p>Seattle never had the kind of laws that, in places such as Little Rock, Ark., forbade white and minority students from going to school together.</p>
<p>But Seattle did have housing covenants and other discriminatory practices that limited minority families to certain neighborhoods. The school segregation that those practices caused was what the district&rsquo;s busing plan, adopted in 1977, was designed to change. The district turned to busing after more than a decade of other efforts, including a voluntary transfer program that, at its peak in 1969-70, attracted just 3 percent of district students.</p>
<p>Mandatory busing involved about 12,000 of the district&rsquo;s 54,000 students. Three years after it started, the district reached its racial-enrollment goals.</p>
<p>By 1980, only one school &mdash; Cleveland High &mdash; still was considered &#8220;racially imbalanced&#8221; because its minority population was 20 percentage points or more above the district average.</p>
<p>But mandatory busing didn&rsquo;t create as much diversity as the numbers might appear to show. White enrollment dropped by 28 percent in the first three years of busing, with many students moving to the suburbs or private schools, according to a district history of its desegregation efforts. (Minority enrollment over the same period went up about 10 percent.)</p>
<p>More minority than white students ended up riding buses, despite careful planning to avoid that. And too many schools, integrated on paper, were still segregated in the lunchroom, and sometimes even the classroom.</p>
<p>Busing did not achieve one of its main goals, which was to raise academic achievement, said Dorothy Woods, who spent decades as a teacher, principal and instructional coach in Seattle schools.</p>
<p>It did not improve relationships between teachers and students, she said, or rigor, or instruction.</p>
<p>As the district reduced busing in 1989, then ended it entirely eight years later, the racial balance at many schools continued to unravel.</p>
<p>From 1970 to today, the district&rsquo;s enrollment dropped from 85,000 students to 45,000. The nonwhite enrollment nearly tripled, and is now 58 percent. The city&rsquo;s population, over the same time period, grew 8 percent, and its minority population more than doubled.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something the Seattle School Board is considering, although not to a large degree.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hard truth,&#8221; says School Board member Steve Sundquist, &#8220;is that the school district is hard-pressed to single-handedly overturn segregated housing patterns in the city.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Split is economic as well as racial</b></p>
<p>Today, black and Asian-American students each make up 22 percent of the mix in Seattle. The Latino population &mdash; at 12 percent &mdash; is growing the fastest, and there&rsquo;s one school &mdash; Concord in West Seattle &mdash; where the majority of students are Latino. Native Americans make up 2 percent.</p>
<p>About 60 percent of the district&rsquo;s schools have a mix of three or more ethnic groups in significant numbers, something that sets Seattle apart from cities where the racial divide is between black and white or Latino and white.</p>
<p>Different areas of the city, however, vary widely from the districtwide averages.</p>
<p>In the southeast, for example, 93 percent of the public-school, elementary-age students who live there are nonwhite. In Queen Anne and Magnolia, it&rsquo;s 27 percent.</p>
<p>In the north end as a whole (plus Queen Anne and Magnolia), minorities make up 40 percent of public-school students. In the south, they comprise 72 percent.</p>
<p>Parents Involved in Community Schools, the group that filed the lawsuit against the racial tiebreaker, argued in court that Seattle no longer needed the racial tiebreaker because the city&rsquo;s high schools already are racially diverse. The group looked at data from 2000-01, when only one high school &mdash; Rainier Beach &mdash; had a student body that was less than 10 percent white.</p>
<p>The picture has changed since then. Three high schools &mdash; Rainier Beach, Cleveland and Franklin &mdash; now have white populations under 10 percent. At the elementary level, some schools have just a handful of white kids, or just a few minority ones.</p>
<p>Wing Luke Elementary, for example, counted four white children among its 322 students last fall. At Dunlap, there are seven. At Loyal Heights Elementary in Northwest Seattle, there are 10 black students, 17 Asian-Americans, 27 Latinos, two Native Americans &mdash; and 323 whites.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s north-south split is economic as well as racial.</p>
<p>In the north, there is just one elementary school where three-quarters of students qualify for free or low-cost lunches. In the south, there are 14.</p>
<p>Housing and income patterns, however, don&rsquo;t explain everything about the racial mix in Seattle schools.</p>
<p>In one case, the district created a school designed for one ethnic group, the African American Academy. Parents and community leaders pushed to open that school as a place that would nurture African-American students and teach them about African-American culture and history.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seattle has five elementary schools, for example, where the percentage of nonwhite students is far greater than the percentage of nonwhite students who live in the surrounding neighborhood.</p>

			<p>Whites have always voted with their feet.  The fact that an arrogant, ignorant, activist supreme court made an unconstitutional ruling in Brown(and has been continuing to make similar clearly unconstitutional rulings since) is clearly not enough, even with the force of the police state to make integration of whites and blacks work.  They will never live or go to school together on an equal footing because they are not truly equal and never will be.</p>

			<p>Seattle is Obama-land and home of so many elitist, artistic, and literary whites who rant with righteousness about their superior moral development and enlightened racial tolerance. In truth, their &#8220;other friends&#8221; are more likely to be upwardly mobile Asians with graduate degrees, not downtown blacks. They can still explain away the civilizational, educational, and intellectual differences with blacks as correctible environmental and nutritional deficiencies. La La Land has moved up the coast from California where citizens are finally figuring out that white American culture, blemished as it is, is worth saving. African American students in every class, at every grade-level, in every school, in every school district, in every state, and in every mixed race nation are underperformers as compared to white and Asian kids. Can anyone cite as single school anywhere where this is not so?  I rather enjoy the humorous dissonance of white flight Obamaites whose true racial attitudes are expressed by where they enroll their little darlings. It&rsquo;s the same all over the world, even in the enclaves of the last true believers.</p>

<p>Go figure.  In 1970 the nonwhite enrollment was about 18 percent.  Once you reach a tipping point, discipline and learning decrease sharply.  In 1970 Seattle was not too far below 25-30 percent, white parents saw what was coming and those who could afford it pulled their kids out of the public system.  <br>

			<p> &#8221; Racial &ldquo;balance&rdquo; is a thing of the past. &#8220;</p>
<p>Does being &#8220;in the past&#8221; mean a thing is necessarily inferior?<br>
I&rsquo;m a little confused. I thought that the concept of &#8220;inferiority&#8221; was an affront to Egalitarianism. I thought that we were supposed to be seeing the world with perfect clinical sterility.  Are we now to understand that that was the &#8220;old&#8221; Egalitarianism? and that the &#8220;New&#8221; Egalitarianism permits of the contemplation of Superiority? <br>
We all know that New is unquestionably better than Old, dont we?<br>
And isnt that a perfectly orthodoxical statement of the Enlightment faith? Surely we will agree that the Enlightenment is a thing of the past, wont we? What say ye Oh ye Enlightened Ones?</p>

			<p>This isn&rsquo;t hard   &mdash;   whites moved out once intra-district deseg started.  That way, there could never be racially balanced (i.e. some whites) schools within Seattle because there aren&rsquo;t any whites in Seattle left.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Busing worked on paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Busing did not achieve one of its main goals, which was to raise academic achievement, said Dorothy Woods, who spent decades as a teacher, principal and instructional coach in Seattle schools.

As the district reduced busing in 1989, then ended it entirely eight years later, the racial balance at many schools continued to unravel.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now, if only they would admit to the absolute, dismal failure of integration for our entire society as a whole, we might be able to keep from splitting violently along lines of race and ethnicity in the near future.</p>
<p>Having a dialogue on race means to recognize that integration is a failure and discussing a peaceful partition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Change,&#8221; can be defined as what is going to occur when blacks have their enclaves and whites have theirs.</p>
<p>We either recognize that out-of-touch elitists determnined integration was viable on paper, but, as with busing, it&rsquo;s a abysmal failure in real life terms, or we start drawing the battle lines, because, in the end, it will all be the same, only with fewer people.</p>

			<p>kids are mere pawns to be tossed around to fulfill these liberals&rsquo; utopian dreams, despite the fact that everyone universally opposes integration whenever given a choice.  despicable.</p>

<i>&#8220;We like to think of ourselves as these enlightened, liberal folks,&#8221; says School Board member Harium Martin-Morris. &#8220;But the fact is our schools aren&rsquo;t the way that people really think they are.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The problem is that liberals believe everyone has, or should have, their view on every issue. They arrogantly, wrongly, and desperately want to believe everyone thinks as they do.</p>
<p>The fact is the schools are the way they are, not because people aren&rsquo;t aware of the segregation &#8216;problem&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s that most parents are keenly aware of the INTEGRATION problem and they are actively working to protect their children from integration.</p>
<p>I propose a compromise.</p>
<p>IF liberals want integration, let them set up specific schools that work to achieve a racial balance. That way, parents can send their kids to blacks schools or white schools or integrated schools of their choice.  </p>
<p>Although many on this board may not like my second proposal, I would suggest that a funding formula be set up where blacks schools are given slightly more money per black student to compensate for any alleged historic social imbalance. </p>
<p>My third proposal would be that if schools are found to be doing better than other schools, instead of trying to create a racially balanced school, the school board should look long and hard at what makes one school more successful than another and the poorly performing school should adapt the same programs as the highly performing schools.</p>

			<p>Why not let the apples fall where they may&gt;? Simple, do schools assignments according to where you live. Problem solved. Then minorities won&rsquo;t be subjected to white liberal racism.</p>
<p><br>
These are the race realists of course, in Washington state, that openly said &#8220;Planning ahead&#8221; etc was a &#8220;white thing&#8221;. And it is.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In one case, the district created a school for one ethnic group, the African American Academy.  Parents and community leaders pushed to open that school as a place that would nurture African-American students and teach them about African-American culture and history.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a novel, wholesome idea!  Now, what would those same parents and community leaders think of using public money to create a European American Academy for THAT particular minority ethnic group?</p>
<p>I suspect this would result in shedding too much light on the IQ/learning/achievement gap.  I also suspect that the school wouldn&rsquo;t be large enough to accommodate the throng that would apply for enrollment; including those &#8220;of color&#8221; who can&rsquo;t abide white people having anything to themselves.     </p>

			<p>&#8220;The Seattle School Board is weighing what, if anything, to do about the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Why? Are minorities being harmed by not being around white students? If yes, what justifies subjecting these harmful minorities to the white students then in the first place? Don&rsquo;t they matter to the school board?</p>

<p>You mix clean water and dirty water, you get dirty water. Instead of well educated students of both races, you get little Eminems aping the dominant culture of the ghetto dwellers.</p>

			<p>At lest two catastrophes resulted from forced integration.</p>
<p>Whites lost billions of dollars buying new houses that were no better than the ones they were driven from.  This money could have been invested to improve the lives of all Americans.  So the victims of forced integration and the rest of America are poorer.  </p>
<p>Also the once beautiful neighborhoods have been turned into &ldquo;hoods&rdquo;.  The blacks are worse off now missing out on the rising tide lifts all boats benefits of white generated improvement, and forced to live among the government engineered degenerated minority stock. <br>

			<p>Likely one reason there are not enough white kids in Seattle schools to satisfy some school administrator&rsquo;s diversity fetish, is that Seattle is becoming one of those cities where white families just don&rsquo;t live.  Lots of singles, gays, and lesbians.  Seattle also has lots of those fanatical eco-commandos who don&rsquo;t believe in having kids (you know, the human extinction movement loons).</p>
<p>Maybe the Seattle school-board should pay white parents to move there and enroll there kids in public schools.  They should pay them alot to do it.</p>

			<p>One Milwaukee suburb ( and others) are watching the schools decline as blacks move into neighborhoods where the schools are &#8220;good&#8221; and white.<br>
The result has been a steady decline in standards and less safe schools.<br>
As this suburb tips to be majority non white we see why the black kids do poorly. At their houses there is a permanent party. There is a clear hatred of learning and a hatred of white European culture. The Asian kids on the other hand, are doing very well, on par with whites, but both are finding the schools intolerable as the blacks bring in gang culture and what is basically a peasant attitude towards learning.<br>
As we move out to more white suburbs, the blacks follow us, clearly thinking that a good school system will benefit them. Of course it doesn&rsquo;t</p>

			<p>&#8220;But Seattle Public Schools, like many districts across the nation, has slowly, steadily resegregated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, people don&rsquo;t want to send their kids to school with a lot of blacks because too many of them ruin the school with their crime and bad behavior. I think it&rsquo;s funny that it has come home to Seattle, one of the most leftist cities in the country. They were all for integration until it landed at THEIR door.</p>

			<p>Brown v. Board in conjunction with the leftist agenda to destroy traditional western institutions is why American kids today can&rsquo;t find Canada on a map. </p>
<p>Blacks lower the level of discourse. Always. Always. Always. </p>
<p>The violence and crime they bring are just an added bonus. </p>
<p>And oh, I was bussed: I went to public schools from kindergarten through the eighth grade.  Like my middle school, the Junior High I went to was pretty ugly.  I can remember an eighth-grade art class I was in that had not one, but two pregnant girls in it, one girl who would drink vodka out of her purse, and a guy who was at least sixteen, if not older, who would blurt out profanity randomly  &mdash;   it was hard to tell if he was truly retarded, or just stupid.  I also remember one day where I encountered three different fights going on in one hallway while on the way to class. The bathrooms always smelled like marijuana.</p>
<p>9th-12th I went to a private school, having begged my parents. Night and Day.  There were maybe 5 blacks in a school of 800.  Sheer fear of numbers made for a no-chimpout educational experience, one not dumbed down for the sake of diversity and equality.  </p>
<p>The American public education system, 100 years ago, was the envy of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now garbage, and no one who values their children should send them to a public school.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Seattle is Obama-land and home of so many elitist, artistic, and literary whites who rant with righteousness about their superior moral development and enlightened racial tolerance. In truth, their &ldquo;other friends&rdquo; are more likely to be upwardly mobile Asians with graduate degrees, not downtown blacks. They can still explain away the civilizational, educational, and intellectual differences with blacks as correctible environmental and nutritional deficiencies. La La Land has moved up the coast from California where citizens are finally figuring out that white American culture, blemished as it is, is worth saving. African American students in every class, at every grade-level, in every school, in every school district, in every state, and in every mixed race nation are underperformers as compared to white and Asian kids. Can anyone cite as single school anywhere where this is not so?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is so true. I live in a secure white enclave called Bainbridge Island; secured carefully by high housing prices and a expensive ferry system for access. Island is 98% white, 1.5 Asian and 0.38% black. From this distance the elites watch the horrors of Seattle school district while sending their well mannered children to white schools. Literally billions of dollars are spent on the seattle school district, gangs run rampant, drugs, violence, knifings, shootings are everywhere. For LESS money per student, the island turns out one gifted student after another.    </p>

			<p>The INTENT of forced busing to end segregated school systems was intended to ensure better education for Blacks. The RESULT of forced busing to integrate schools is a sharp LOWERING IN THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION FOR NON-BLACK STUDENTS!</p>
<p>Which explains why concerned parents would rather sacrifice and skrimp to send their kids to private or religious schools, or move out of a geographic area entirely.</p>
<p>Black parents almost never concern themselves with the quality of education their offspring receive. Knowing full well welfare and crime will support their kids from cradle to grave. Any questions?<br>

			<p>   In all the years that this country has tried to force different people together through outlandish practices as integration, billions, possibly trillions of dollars were wasted. Race relations are worse now than ever before. The educational system has failed, we score lower than most &#8220;first world countries&#8221; ie. western countries. Education has been dumbed down to try and help minorities keep up. Schools have become a dangerous place for our children to be. The only answer, at least short term, and economically feasible, would be to home-school our children. There is no way our children can get an education in the public school system. There is something wrong in America today, actually something evil. And our children are the ones in danger. </p>

<p>&gt; Mine too, Reader&hellip; What strikes me about this Seattle story is the reputation Seattle has for being liberal and left in public policy.  But it seems as if the actual majority was against integration from the start and still is today.  Was doest it mean?  To me, it seems to mean that somehow all the liberals in Seattle somehow got into government mid level positions and have had their way through image making and guilt tripping the population.  As a telling example, I know at least one - one time Berkeley radical student that was in favor of busing until it concerned her children.</p>
<p>Reality bites and has been biting for at least three decades.  But the dreamers remain and still try to sell their dreams.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the majority of the problem lies in the passive protestant (Lutheran) style culture of Northerners.  They can&rsquo;t imagine being impolite or seeming racist.  But they actually don&rsquo;t like the results of their style of Christianity.  As one brought up as a Lutheran and familiar with Garrison Keelor&rsquo;s portrayals of Lutheran&rsquo;s (for comedy) I can see how this works in states like Wisconsin, Michigan and other norther states like Washington - where I happen to live.</p>

			<p>The real trouble is going to start when the white areas refuse to fund the non-white areas with their taxes.  An attempt to force whites to pay, with legislation, will be made.  That attempt will fail, as local and state governments refuse to cooperate because of past abuse and trampling of their rights (not to mention the disastrous effects we&rsquo;ve seen over the last 40 years or so).  Expect rioting in the non-white areas followed by a brutal crackdown by the federal government.</p>
<p>It will be the beginning of our federal system, at long last, admitting that non-whites are not only an incredible burden, but the only real threat to their power.</p>

			<p>I wonder what the integrationists really think they can do now that there aren&rsquo;t enough white kids left to integrate the schools.  It&rsquo;s interesting that they can admit that integration was a failure   &mdash;   it didn&rsquo;t raise black academic achievement, it didn&rsquo;t make the races love one another   &mdash;   but they still think it&rsquo;s a desirable thing to do.  The only conclusion I can come to is that the advocates of racial integration have as their primary motivation the desire to punish white people.<br>

			<p>Whites have always voted with their feet. The fact that an arrogant, ignorant, activist supreme court made an unconstitutional ruling in Brown(and has been continuing to make similar clearly unconstitutional rulings since) is clearly not enough, even with the force of the police state to make integration of whites and blacks work. They will never live or go to school together on an equal footing because they are not truly equal and never will be.</p>

			<p>If &#8220;diversity&#8221; were a natural state there would be no need for the term &#8220;diversity&#8221;! Were &#8220;diversity&#8221; desirable there would be no need for busing since the neighborhoods themselves would be diverse. If diversity benefited minorities there would be no need for affirmative action. Apparently, this country&rsquo;s concept of equity is to artificially assist those elements who are incapable of competing on their own. The only time one finds the Japanese &#8220;complaining&#8221;, for example, is when the &#8220;quota&#8221; limits their number into the desirable educational institutions. </p>
<p>In any large populations there are always statistical abnormalities that exceed the mean. But for those individuals, irrespective of race, who are for whatever reason, fortunate enough to be bright, common intellectual ability creates a bond which trumps race; however, that is the rare exception, not the general rule. If, as the egghead liberal professors assert, there is no difference intellectually between the races, then why is there this continual emphasis on &#8220;diversity&#8221;!          </p>

<p>The euphemism for what you describe is called by the Black politicians and their parasitical constituency as &#8220;consolidation&#8221;.</p>
<p>King Willie Herenton and the local Black politicians of Memphis have been trying to push consolidation schemes for years. The welfare populace of Memphis grows and grows, while the productive White taxpayers have been fleeing the city for decades. So now the city is trying to parasatize the Whites who&rsquo;ve fled the city but still live in the county. </p>
<p>If Memphis can&rsquo;t find more taxpayers to parasatize it will eventually end up like Detroit and be almost wholly kept afloat by state and federal tax dollars.</p>
<p>As America&rsquo;s cities grow ever browner and blacker and become little more than third world welfare holding pens, you will see ever more schemes to rob the productive White parts of America in order to keep these brown and black welfare colonies going. </p>

			<p>American academia is ideologically distracted about the most beneficial way to organize elementary and high school education - which obviously never should have been along racial quota lines in a boneheaded attempt to achieve &#8220;equal&#8221; results, but in layered grade classes grouped according to individual performance, with two-way mobility between groups according to individual achievement, grade by grade.</p>
<p>This would be the intelligent way to structure educational institutions, wherein students would naturally find their own true level. A way which would blessedly get irrelevant ideology and social philosophy the hell out of the academic picture. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for us all, American academia has long since abandoned quality of education as a primary concern, and for the last four decades have spent their time trying to stamp every students into same-size multi-color cookies, thus ignoring natural realities that stare them in the face every day, diligently wasting the public&rsquo;s time and taxes, and thoroughly disgracing themselves and their profession. </p>

Just look at the wasted taxpayers money bo buy buses so kids can be transferred to another district .  dident make sense back then and does notmake sese now&hellip;misfit</p>
