						<p>White teenagers are less likely to go to university than school-leavers from other ethnic groups &mdash; even with the same A-level results, according to official figures.</p>
<p>The gap is widest among male teenagers from poor backgrounds, raising fresh fears that working class boys are becoming the education &#8220;underclass&#8221; in England.</p>
<p>According to a Government report, just over one-in-20 white boys from poor homes goes on to university.</p>
<p>This compares to 66 per cent of Indian girls and 65 per cent of young women from Chinese families.</p>
<p>An analysis published by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills said the rise in the number of women going to university over the last 10 or 20 years &#8220;had made the performance of males look relatively dismal&#8221;.</p>
<p>The report said many working class white boys dropped out of education at the earliest opportunity, aged 16.</p>
<p>Bill Rammell, the higher education minister, said schools needed to intervene at an earlier age to get white boys interested in college and university.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that culture plays a very important role,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Part of what we have to do is to look across society and look among the ethnic minority groups where there is a very strong attachment to education and try to learn from that.&#8221;</p>
<p>An analysis carried out by the DIUS looked at the number of teenagers going on to university, broken down by gender, ethnicity, social class and achievement at school.</p>
<p>It found that women were in the minority at university up to 1992, but over the last 15 years the balance had shifted.</p>
<p>Last year the proportion of young men studying for a degree fell to 35 per cent, compared to 47 per cent of women.</p>
<p>Despite fears that women are much more likely to go to university, the report said ethnicity and social class had a &#8220;larger&#8221; bearing on staying on rates.</p>
<p>The gaps &#8220;did not disappear entirely&#8221; even when comparing students with the same A-level results, researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, in the case of ethnicity, it was overwhelmingly clear the young people from non-white backgrounds were much more likely to participate in higher education than their white peers with similar prior attainment,&#8221; said the study.</p>
<p>Just six per cent of white boys eligible for free school meals went to university compared to 26 per cent of working class young men from ethnic minority backgrounds. Some 34 per cent of girls from deprived ethnic minority families went to university, according to researchers.</p>
<p>Young white men from poor homes were eight and a half times less likely to go to university than ethnic minority women from middle-class families.</p>
<p>Among some ethnic groups, university participation rates were even higher.</p>
<p>Overall, 58 per cent of men from Indian backgrounds and 66 per cent of women go on to university. Among Chinese families, 60 per cent of boys and 65 per cent of women go to university.</p>
<p>Black Caribbean boys were the only group less likely to go to university than white boys.</p>
<p>The Conservatives said the disclosure proved that Labour was failing pupils from poor homes.</p>
<p>But the Government insisted a series of programmes had been launched to break down the barriers, including sending successful male role models into state schools.</p>
<p>In Leicester, undergraduates hold a football competition for schoolboys to give them a taste of student life.</p>
<p>It is also hoped the Government&rsquo;s new-style diploma qualifications &mdash; combining work-based training and classroom study &mdash; will prove more popular than traditional A-levels among many young men.<br>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s say all this is true.  I don&rsquo;t think white working class boys and men will become an &#8220;underclass&#8221; in the same sense as blacks.  After all, would you fear walking through the few remaining white working class neighborhoods at a late hour?</p>

			<p>Incredible!  This is what happens when you take a white country and invite in millions of non-whites and give the non-whites preference.  You end up by replacing the old white ruling class with a non-white, non-English one.  This is presumably one of the central goals of the multiculturalists and they must be very happy with the outcome of their work.  The fact that this involves the destruction of the native white population or its relegation to underclass status must also gladden their little hearts.</p>

			<p>Britain isn&rsquo;t going to do anything about this disturbing trend.  This is what their liberal powers-that-be want and even thrive on. It will only get worse (that&rsquo;s liberal for &#8220;better&#8221;) when it is discovered that some universities are just too White (and/or too White male) to be tolerated.   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening in the US, too, only the &#8220;Carribean boys&#8221; would be welcomed with open arms here, particularly if they&rsquo;re athletes.  At least Britain&rsquo;s Asian students are serious learners, studying science and medicine, and they are probably getting good grades. </p>

			<p>I noticed this while attending UCLA. I estimate that between 5-10% (or less) of college undergrads are non-Jewish, heterosexual, white men from the middle and working classes, although this group constitutes roughly 30% of the population. There is no doubt that this demographic represents a &#8220;political identity&#8221; and that it is completely unrepresented, while at the same time it is the most overly taxed. Our numbers are even lower at the graduate level. This is, of course, reflected in the professional ranks.</p>

			<p>Betrayed from within by white feminists, harranged from without by a sea of envious third worlders, ridiculed by continual liberal academic propoganda&hellip;. yes the white man is down&hellip;.But not out. We will survive. The continual barrage of grants and institutional encouragements to all peoples outside the white hetero male category,.. to excel in the typical white male stations has helped to hamstring the white male socially economically and psychologically&hellip;.But&hellip; we&rsquo;ll be back, because its in our genes and in the stars. Incidentally.. I harbor no malice toward any other breed of man, I only feel the need to represent and perpetuate my own.</p>

And if any program were enacted to help these boys, as soon as it became a success, it would be co-opted to suit the needs of non-whites.</p>
<p>In my neighborhood of South Buffalo, a local politician set up a job training, GED school for our community. As soon as it became successful, all the non-whites decided it was the place for a second chance. It&rsquo;s no longer a neighborhood school and now caters to everyone but white South Buffalo residents.</p>
<p>Blacks can&rsquo;t make these programs work in their community so once again, they have to take what they can&rsquo;t make for themselves.<br>

			<p>This is an example of what I was saying in another comment I leftconcerning affrimative action. </p>
<p>The pitiful greedy cretins that compose England&rsquo;s government turned their backs on their own White children and are now concerned because they&rsquo;re lagging behind the immigrant/minorities whom they&rsquo;ve given entitlements to all these years.</p>
<p> All the while serving their own English children ample portions of White guilt&hellip;&hellip;and NOW they wonder why the kids have given up! It amazes me how modern governments of Anglo/Nordic/Euro nations are so determined to destroy their own people. But it amazes me even more how these people are just sitting back and allowing them to do so.</p>

			<p>THE GOVERNMENT SPONSORED GENOCIDE OF THE WHITE MALE.</p>
<p>High schools discourage white students from attending college.  Corporations do not have any OUT REACH for white boys and do not allow white boys to take part in BRING YOUR DAUGHTER TO WORK activities.  Trips to companies and colleges are only open to the BLACK and TAN student.  In addition, white male students are prevented from enrolling in the higher level advanced placement courses offered during the summer to BLACKS and TANS.  Today&rsquo;s female feminest teacher considers the slower learner male student as a trouble maker, an inferior, and worthless.</p>
<p>Male students are also graded at the same low standards as the BLACK and TAN student but will never get admitted to college without the kind of one-on-one remedial work given to the BLACK and TANS for free.</p>
<p>Private schools are the only hope for the White Middle Class.</p>

			<p>I suppose the browbeating of whites taught as doctrine in the British public educational system has taken its toll.  Probably many on the left in Britain are reading these results with glee.  In Britain, as in many Western nations, representative government does not exist anymore.  The government and the courts are so rigged with leftists there is no way for the people to gain control again.  Unfortunately, that may leave an overthrow of the government as the only remaining option.</p>
<p>Revolutions have occurred countless times in human history, why not now?</p>

			<p>If Chinese work harder and study harder and outcompete white people in university spots fairly, what&rsquo;s the problem? </p>
<p>Is it true that whites can&rsquo;t compete academically with Chinese? </p>
<p>Tell me it ain&rsquo;t so&hellip;</p>

			<p>Remember that the American engineering cadre comes from the ranks of the lower middle classes; they are the smart boys of the working classes.</p>
<p>And that is why they have been run over by American Big Business with their imported H-1B army.</p>
<p>The American Techies have absolutely ZERO clout to protect themselves from the economic forces arrayed against them.</p>

-   &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
The crowing irony in this -  the outrage, really   &mdash;   is that the Labour Party was supposed to be the champion, the representative, of the working class and the poor.   Now it&rsquo;s revealed for the wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing that it really is.</p>
<p>Elitist Marxists aren&rsquo;t concerned for the workers at all. They want to eliminate them and replace them with a more manipulable electorate.</p>

<p>And I noticed this last month when I had occasion to ride through the Univ. of Calif. at San Diego, La Jolla,  on a Sunday afternoon.   I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing that almost all the faces there were Asian.  In fact, I saw only one young man that I would consider  Caucasian, and  he was a dark Semitic type. Not one of those  &#8220;California blonds&#8221;   that the Beach Boys used to sing about!  </p>
<p>Oh, well. That was back then.</p>

			<p>As a number of posts have indicated, this is pretty bad. Many groups are forming, often around the immigration issue, often locally. Many are fairly informal. For example, many of the outgrowths of the Ron Paul groups (in the US) are often continuing - search in meetup.com .  Although note that there are forces within some of the groups, like the outgrowths of the Ron Paul groups, that are trying to push away from immigration issues, but at least in my group, some immigration activists regained influence.<br>
The point is, start organizing or getting connected or something. Also get savvy. Don&rsquo;t throw your efforts away. But neither be intimidated by all the wishy washiness about us. <br>
If you go to a group and someone makes even a brief statement against illegal immigration, ask the person afterwards if there are some other groups to attend. There can be a wide variety of kinds of groups, from ones that work on tax reform with an additional fearful approach to immigration, to groups that worry openly about the survival of whites. There is also a lot of ferment at the local political level to put local people in office friendlier to our causes, at least in my area (Las Vegas). <br>
Get connected. And don&rsquo;t give up right away. Where you can, try to get information on what ideas are working and aren&rsquo;t working. Become activist, don&rsquo;t only talk pie in the sky. <br>
Even searching on line can lead to groups in your area that you didn&rsquo;t know of. For instance in our area a new chapter of Council of Conservative Citizens,( http://cofcc.org/ with a statement by Sam Francis, is possibly forming), and you could have found this out just by googling it. Of course be a little cautious of a group for a little while till you get a little bit of feel for the group, and don&rsquo;t commit till then.<br>
Don&rsquo;t expect the whole thing to be an easy haul. It seems there are problems of every sort. But it also seems there is more determination and fear than ever before. Somehow try to gain savvy - find people to share savvy - dont expect to find the right people for yourself right away, but at least know this is one of the things you are looking for. And there are many people who can at least share some savvy with you.</p>

			<p>I am lost to understand why white founded governments have betrayed their own cohesive cultures to prove others are equal or better.  Other countries do not demote/deprave their own for others.  Something is wrong and it sits in the governments of betrayed white people.   V</p>

			<p>  I can tell you the answer right now, I&rsquo;m white, have two white kids and guess what, I can&rsquo;t get a dime in tuition aid for them, I&rsquo;m paying out of pocket for both. I&rsquo;m sure some under achieving minority is enjoying college at my expense though.</p>

Tsk tsk. The marxists need an oppressor class. Who will it be if White males are no longer branded oppressors?<br>

			<p>Re..&#8221;You end up by replacing the old white ruling class with a non-white, non-English one. This is presumably one of the central goals of the multiculturalists and they must be very happy with the outcome of their work&hellip;&#8221;<br>
The ruling class of Britain is not being replaced. The working middle class is; the relinquished whites are sinking down under the weight of the leftist - elitist - statist class which serves as the shock troops of the rulers. The colored are there to serve as a buffer easily manipulated because they have no origin-based claim to rights. Remember, Britain has no formal Bill of Rights; its civility is a matter of tradition, and traditions can always be broken. Muslim noisemakers can&rsquo;t break this system down because they can be quickly rounded-up. Britain is a surveillance society, and always a few steps away from being a police state.</p>

			<p>This country has subjected the white male to quite a cultural beating over the decades. They would rather build prisons for young white males than see them brought up proud and educated. </p>
<p>Only the soft white modern liberal honky white males are celebrated by our society anymore. You know the kind&hellip; like meathead in Archie Bunker&rsquo;s All in the Family.</p>
<p>Real men like John Wayne are simply imprisoned today and blocked from the opportunities they once had in yesteryear. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing as fun as a little bit of deconstruction on the deconstructionists. Good one! And it&rsquo;s simply playing by the established rules. It&rsquo;s the highest form of enlightened scholarship!  lol  Too bad we don&rsquo;t get pay and awards for our efforts. Keep up the good work though. It&rsquo;s what they deserve every waking minute of the day.  </p>

			<p>We Whites have been played for the biggest patsies in history. I would move to another country but I&rsquo;ve got nowhere else to go. All the White countries have been forced to integrate while everyone else has maintained their racial and cultural purity. One day the key won&rsquo;t fit in the front door of the country and we will be scratching our heads on the stoop. &#8220;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on?&#8221; &#8220;You don&rsquo;t have a home here any more&#8221; says the minority leaning out of your second story window. Your teeth will clench and the nails will bite into the palm of your hand. All the wars that we&rsquo;ve fought and died for, the constitution, Thomas Jefferson, Washington, Ben Franklin, the moon landing. Why?</p>

			<p>In Stanford, UC Davis, UC Berkeley, UCLA, it&rsquo;s hardest to get in if you&rsquo;re Chinese. The hierarchy of most difficult races for admission goes: Chinese, Caucasian, southeast Asian, Latino, and Black. </p>
<p>Yet Chinese are very much overrepresented in all of those top schools in California. A White and a Chinese with the same academic record, the White will get in before the Chinese. Yet Chinese still oftentimes dominate in numbers. </p>
<p>Do White people want to act like Blacks and complain if their test scores and grades aren&rsquo;t better than Chinese kids, yet want preferential treatment based solely on race? Do we want affirmative action for White people? </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that an admission of academic failure as compared with Chinese kids? (just like black affirmative action in schools is an admission of academic failure of black kids compared to white kids)</p>
<p>Like what we&rsquo;d say to Blacks, (&#8220;stop complaining and asking for preferential racial treatment and start studying and focusing on schoolwork. That&rsquo;s how you get ahead.&#8221;) I believe we should say to Whites in relation to Chinese. </p>
<p>White children simply need to apply themselves more in school and get those A&rsquo;s that Chinese kids do. Mind your schoolwork. There&rsquo;s no excuse. </p>
<p>Treating everyone the same without regard for racial preferences and only looking at individual merit and achievement, that is our goal. Anything else is akin to Black PC affirmative action. </p>

<p>White societies were built for the benefit of white people, not for the benefit of the chinese.  </p>

			<p>There actually already is a large white underclass in Britain.  It has grown along with the growth of the welfare state.  It participates in the welfare culture just as much as the third worlders do.  It is an example of a systematic policy of self destruction.</p>

			<p>The modern liberal war against white boys, in the aggregate, has been very successful.</p>
<p>Read this article: <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200005/war-against-boys" rel="nofollow">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200005/war-against-boys</a></p>
<p>Generations of white boys (not to be confused with the urban derogatory &#8220;whiteboy&#8221; slang used against all white males regardless of age) in the USA and UK have grown into the men that built their countries, fought their wars, and led them into victory after victory for generations.</p>
<p>And this is how they are repaid?</p>

			<p>I have two young girls and I send them to a school here in Sydney. It is a private school but not an expensive one that caters for ages all the way from kindie to high-school. I won&rsquo;t mention the name for fear of the do-gooders targetting it. Everytime I go there I am in heaven. There are NO third worlders or asians. It&rsquo;s like a holiday camp for anglos. I&rsquo;m not quite sure why this is, maybe the location. But I can tell you one thing. There are no guns, no knives, no fights, no gang-members and NO PROBLEMS!</p>

			<p>Start getting savvy, in lots of ways. A few ideas are in this thread. Experience and sharing experiences and information is one way. Try to find individuals or sort of groups of sort of like minded individuals to your more important values.<br>
I got involved with the Ron Paul campaign here in the US. Eventually it turned out a way to meet people against various parts of political correctness. A few days ago I got a letter - a mass mailing - from Ron Paul. Now that the presidential campaign has come to an end, they want to keep the energy of freedom (to me that freedom to think and reason based on facts) continuing. The new website, just starting, for the new continuing campaign is <br>
 www.campaignforliberty.com <br>
There were lots and lots of different idea-ed people in the Ron Paul movement. Personally I think some of the ideas need some more careful thought and criticism. But at least disagreement is not silenced with the label of &#8220;hate and racism&#8221;. <br>
Keep tabs on this site. Ideas and groups may pop out of it. Also try meetup.com  -  it only takes stumbling on one cluster of individuals to start to find out about a number of other splinter groups (splintering is human nature, and it is diversity in its good form).</p>
<p>As far as getting savvy, you don&rsquo;t realize how many ways there are until you start doing it. You realize there are new functional savvy issues at each rung which you did not imagine till you stepped up on it and spent some time on it and got experience by going out into the real world or by sharing such experiences. Also if you have the temperament, go to some organized existing groups even if you don&rsquo;t agree with them and see how they manage to stay organized and effective. Final thought. One of our biggest challenges is coming up with a sufficiently broad formula that works.<br>

			<p>you may ask your self, why I would care about an article like this, well guess what, its because I happen to be viewed as &#8220;white&#8221; by the vast majority of Americans and non-Americans. You see I care about America, and Americans only, don&rsquo;t get me wrong Americans come in all shades and ethnicity, but to be an American that&rsquo;s something else all together. We have a lot of people in America, (not the confusing redefining Latino garbage word for the Americas, that they use to bastardize the United States of America) who are not really Americans, they are here temporarily, they don&rsquo;t want to be Americans, they don&rsquo;t want to learn the American language, they don&rsquo;t want to marry Americans, they don&rsquo;t want to vote for Washington, or Jefferson, they want Juan Vargas, Cruz Glutamate, or Kim Juan Ill. These people vote based on what they can get for &#8220;THEIR&#8221; people, not all Americans, but only &#8220;THEIR RACE, THE RACE,&#8221; These people are not Americans, and they should not continue to live in MY America that&rsquo;s right MY America, because I am an American, I pay taxes, I don&rsquo;t cheat on my taxes I share the burden of all Tax payers in Universal suffrage. Americans don&rsquo;t want socialism, communism, or Fascism. We don&rsquo;t like welfare, EBT, or food stamps. those of us with any amount of intelligence vote for republicans even if we were or are registered democrats. True Americans will fight for their nation, during times of invasion, or dictatorship, and true American uphold the constitution in its written meaning, not the bastardized liberal version of a living, interpret as you go document.  We are True Americans by no other name or hyphenation.</p>

&#8220;Naturalization is the process by which people can become citizens of a country they were not born in. The United States Constitution grants Congress the power &#8220;to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization&#8221; (Article I, section 8, clause 4). Soon after the Constitution was ratified Congress passed the Naturalization Act of 1790 (1 Stat. 103). The act provided</p>
<p>    that any alien, being a free white person, who shall have resided within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the United States for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen thereof, on application to any common law court of record, in any one of the States wherein he shall have resided for the term of one year at least, and making proof to the satisfaction of such court, that he is a person of good character, and taking the oath or affirmation prescribed by law, to support the Constitution of the United States&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

Excellent points, gentlemen. You Whites had it right way back when. </p>
<p>Curiously, though, you Whites then added this : </p>
<p>&#8220;The Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub.L. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, July 2, 1964) was a landmark piece of legislation in the United States that outlawed segregation in schools, public places, and employment. &#8220;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964</a></p>
<p>This Civil Rights Act and other pieces of legislation effectively opened up America for the world. </p>
<p>And the world came. </p>
<p>Chinese came to America, worked very very hard, saved money, bought homes, started their own businesses, and now many are rich. Like me. </p>
<p>And everything thing we did, every step of the way was legal, since America allowed it. (think Civil Rights Act)</p>
<p>Are we Chinese to blame for taking an opportunity to better ourselves when the chance presented itself? </p>
<p>Or are American Whites to blame for opening up your country and giving us the opportunity? </p>
<p>I happen to like it here in America. I pay taxes (boy do I ever. I bought my house for three million dollars with no loans, and taxes are quite a nice chunk of change!), my boys have both served in the military, and I own and run my own business. </p>
<p>Everything I do is legal and allowed under United States law. </p>
<p>I just so happen to be Chinese. </p>
<p>If you guys are upset with me being here, don&rsquo;t blame me. Blame your government. In my shoes being who I was, you would have done the same. <br>

			<p>Boys are having a harder time in school these days in the US.  Apparantly that applies in the UK too.  </p>
<p>A lot of us wackos think boys in general are having a harder time than girls because males are more easily poisoned by the mercury in their vaccines, and by other environmental insults. BPAs and pthalates are two that are starting to get notice after decades in widespread use.</p>
<p>Yes, I still believe in a mercury-autism connection.  Clearly there is more to autism than just mercury, as unvaccinated kids do have about 50% of the rates of autism that vaccinated kids have, but mercury is a big chunk of the cause.</p>
<p>Beyond autism, there is ADHD/ADD and the rapidly increasing rates of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in todays youth.  Not to mention just plain losing IQ points.  Mercury has been shown to kill more cells in petri dishes in presence of testosterone, and fewer cells in the presence of estrogen.</p>
<p>If any of you have kids that have behavioral problems or are just not doing as well in school as you think they should, look at heavy metal exposure.  Some of the damage can be reversed.</p>
