<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>New crime statistics released Wednesday show that just 20 youth are together responsible for 324 offenses in the capital last year.</p>
<p>One 17-year-old boy has the dubious distinction of already having 90 offenses on his police record. He was arrested 12 times last year alone, mostly for theft.</p>
<p>He tops the list of the 20 most active criminals under the age of 18. Last year&rsquo;s most active offender under the age of 18 was just 15 years old. He was arrested 39 times and has a total of 61 offenses on his record since 2004.</p>
<p>Almost all the juvenile offenders are boys. Only one girl was on the list. She piled up 10 offenses last year alone.</p>
<p>Oslo&rsquo;s top politician, municipal board leader Erling Lae of the Conservatives, said the city is setting up a program with the police aimed at tackling the juvenile crime problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a series of measures, like contact with the families, and following up children from the time they start school until they start working,&#8221; Lae said. &#8220;We can never do enough, but we must try to make sure that some groups don&rsquo;t fall out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lae doesn&rsquo;t think the city has been successful in integrating immigrant families into the community. Around 50 youth account for some 20 percent of all juvenile crime in Oslo, and 66 percent of the 50 aren&rsquo;t ethnic Norwegians, even though many have Norwegian citizenship.<br>

			<p>Same old story. Always we haven&rsquo;t done enough to &#8220;integrate&#8221; the unassimiable races into western cultures&hellip;..as if that is the reason! Why isn&rsquo;t there a worldwide movement to shut these commie liberals up? Are we going to let them get away with destroying our people and our lands? Find out who these people are and their agenda and then STOP them.</p>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s no surprise&hellip;of coures old devil whitey is to blame.  I mean who else could we blame for this? Surely not the criminals. </p>

			<p>What are the Norwegians crying about? In NYC, those topping &#8220;the list of the 20 most active criminals under the age of 18&#8221; are all convicted multiple murderers and worse. Robbery would not make the top 100 on this list in NYC or Detroit, or any other major (black) American city.</p>

			<p>Can someone please tell me who these &#8220;children of immigrants&#8221; are? I have a sneaky suspicion it is MUSLIMS. There are lots of Kurds and Iranians in Norway and they are causing plenty of trouble. I bet that is who is doing this. The media really does us a disservice by not reporting the ethnicity of these folks.</p>

<p>&gt; Maybe because it is more tied to the Norwegian&rsquo;s Lutheran Christian outlook than being a communist.</p>
<p>I remember singing &#8220;Jesus loves the little children, all the children of the world&hellip;..&#8221; When I was growing up and spending every Sunday in a Lutheran church.</p>

			<p>Your sneaky suspicion is indeed right, but far worse than Iranians or Kurds, those are samosas, I meant Somalis. True to style, their arrival has led to an epidemic of rape.</p>

<p>Well, Scandinavia as a whole is very secular, so I don&rsquo;t know about that. Multiculturalism has infected almost all white countries, whether they&rsquo;re religious or not, so there must be a more fundamental reason.</p>

			<p>Why oh why don&rsquo;t people in countries like Norway take a good hard look at places like the US and see what happens when you have large numbers of blacks etc.? I guess they don&rsquo;t realize who(blacks) in this country is responsible for most of the gun violence. They could save themselves so much trouble by repatriating these immigrants. However, I&rsquo;m afraid they will have to learn the hard way.</p>

			<p>I am not saying that Europeans should not import Blacks, but they should be very careful about the Blacks that they import. We judiciously screen our African immigrants to the US, and as a result they are the highest performing immigrant group of all. These refugees just seem to be a problem everywhere. Somalis, Sudanese, Liberians&hellip;they just create problems. They can go to other African countries if they are refugees. Refugees are like illegals in that they are unscreened immigrants who are allowed in en masse and hence tend to be problematic.</p>

			<p>One explanation for the importation of Africans into Scandanavia might be snobbery; their elites wantd to prove they could run a multiracial society better than us dumb Yanks.</p>
<p>Someday, I&rsquo;d like to see the native, white rape victims of these Fourth-Worlders file class-action suits against their own government leaders, for having imported the rapists into what had been peaceful, safe countries.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Lost in Paradise,&rsquo; has raised an interesting point. If NYC and Detroit are the models for how far things can get, with still no solution, then think how far the Norwegian cities still have to go before they hit the bottom.</p>

<p>The world seems divided between, those who blame &#8216;communists&rsquo; for all the worlds ills, and those who blame white racists (specifically the former group) for all evil. In other words, the group that really gets blamed. For one group is empowered while the other is not. One of the two groups has a monopoly over public information, and has had this control seemingly forever. As long as I&rsquo;ve been a alive. Two different groups tho. I know which group I blame, and I&rsquo;m a communist sypathizer myself.<br>

			<p>Actually whiteplight the more devoutly christian nations in Europe like Croatia, Poland and Serbia are more racially consious and hence anti-multiculti then secular/athiest England, Sweden, etc nations. My personal observation through years of travelling and analysing European cultures.  </p>
