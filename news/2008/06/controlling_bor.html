<h1>Controlling Border Important for Most Americans</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Angus Reid Global Monitor : Polls &amp; Research, June 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Adults in the United States have a clear idea of what the most important goal of their immigration policy should be, according to a poll by Rasmussen Reports. 63 per cent of respondents believe gaining control of the border should be a priority, while 28 per cent would prefer to legalize the status of undocumented workers already living in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In May 2006, U.S. president George W. Bush addressed the nation to discuss his immigration proposals. Bush outlined five clear objectives: securing the borders, creating a temporary worker program, holding employers to account for the workers they hire, allowing illegal immigrants &#8220;who have roots&#8221; in the country to apply for citizenship, and helping newcomers assimilate into American society.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Polling Data</p>
<p>Which is more important? Gaining control of the border or legalizing the status of undocumented workers already living in the United States?</p>
<p>Gaining control of the border &mdash; 63%</p>
<p>Legalizing undocumented workers &mdash; 28%</p>
<p>Not sure &mdash; 8%</p>
<p>Methodology: Telephone interviews with 1,000 likely American voters, conducted on Jun. 10, 2008. Margin of error is 3 per cent.<br>

			<p>Mexico is a hopelessly corrupt narco-state, with as Lou Dobbs has convincingly proven so many times, hundreds or thousands of hopelessly corrupt politicians. They cannot solve the drug problem because the drug problem IS MEXICO. The whole government is part of it, and the longer this nation deals with Mexico, the more certain that Mexico&rsquo;s corruption will spread across the U.S. We are already having problems with the integrity and maintainance of our own democratic system and its leaders, allowing greater involvment with Mexico will be our end, as even our forefathers knew some hundred and fifty plus years ago.</p>

			<p>Immigration policy and invasion are two different animals. And truly pathetic that there are 28% who don&rsquo;t see it. 10,000 illegal aliens defying our border laws every day is in no way an &#8216;immigration&rsquo; issue. </p>
<p>&#8216;Gaining control&rsquo;. &#8216;Securing the border&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Not enough. Weak language yields weak responses, predictable outcomes. Fail.  </p>
<p>Better deal with the second animal appropriately, otherwise the  invaders will be the ones writing immigration policy. And every other policy thereafter. </p>
<p>How about demanding the border be made &#8216;impregnable&rsquo;? Then back it up with the necessary force and the necessary will to use that force. Can&rsquo;t &#8216;gain control&rsquo; of immigration, can&rsquo;t &#8216;secure the border&rsquo; without it.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s already been proven twice in our history that the only permanent solution to illegal immigration is mass deportation.  Added border security is a plus, but detaining and deporting illegals here in America will alone solve this problem.  It&rsquo;s more than possible to accomplish this; our leaders simply lack the stones to even try. </p>

			<p>It is truly amazing how we live in a country where we have all the institutions of democracy&hellip;..yet we are a de facto fascist state due to apathy of those who live here.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the people who live here want our border SEALED.  Yet, our Presidential candidates are a choice between a black supremacist neo-nazi who wants open borders and a maverick, republican in name only&hellip;..who wants open borders.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because that 63% of the country that wants our border sealed up tight, was too busy watching &#8220;Dancing with the Stars&#8221; to vote during the Presidential primaries.  True conservatives who wanted to seal our country against invasion&hellip;.people like Duncan Hunter and Tom Tancredo got what&hellip;.1% of the vote?  Even those who got their lazy butts off the couch for 5 minutes to stroll on down to vote, couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to spend 5 minutes on the internet searching for who the candidates were.  Hell, they couldn&rsquo;t even be bothered to watch any of the debates or they would have immediately known at the very least that McCain does not represent their best interests (it&rsquo;s sort of assumed these days that the democratic candidates are all nameless, faceless, crazy marxists).</p>
<p>People have ZERO reason to complain.  They had their chance and blew it&hellip;.out of sheer apathy and laziness.</p>

			<p>  Controlling the border is important to the people, not our politicans. Both Obama and McCain support Shamnasty that would legalize 12 to 20 million illegal immigrants. Others have estimated that the relatives of these illegals (who would be able to come under family unification) could add an additional 100 million to our already crowded cities and suburbs.  </p>

			<p>Securing the border is all fine and dandy, but the real solution to solving illegal immigration lies in a multipronged attack aimed at ELIMINATING THE MAGNETS that draw them and keep them here. </p>
<p>1. No birthright citizenship<br>
2. No entitlements. No welfare. No food stamps.<br>
3. No jobs. For employers: 1st offense, $10K/head  2nd offense loss of business charter, 3rd offense mandatory jail and seizure of all assets<br>
4. No hope of citizenship ever. Enact legislation forbidding amnesty to anyone here illegaly under any circumstance.<br>
5. Punishment for being here illegaly. 1st offense, deportation and seizure of all assets in the US, 2nd offense, immediate deportation and banned from entering the US agian for any reason, 3rd offense mandatory 1 year in jail and siezure of assets. And no hearings for assylum.</p>
<p>This is good basis as there must be consequences to their actions or nothing will ever change. The point is to remove the economic and social reasons to come illegaly, and they will stop coming. With no hope of making $ and no hope of citizenship, why bother. Those already here will find it difficult and no incentive to stay so they will leave of their own accord eventually. This is known as the ATTRITION strategy. It will take many years but the problem was a long time in the making and will take time to resolve. But if enacted as described, we would not need to spend $B&rsquo;s each year securing the border. We have sufficient force to watch for drug smugglers and other nefarious people, but they spend their time chasing economic immigrants (who are used as cover by the gangs), not the criminals. We have been soft on the problem as well. So it will take a while to prove we really are serious this time. And, the answer to the problem can not be, just to let everyone in as the libs want. That accomplishes nothing. We are then over run by legal foreigners with the same problem.</p>

			<p>1. No birthright citizenship<br>
2. No entitlements. No welfare. No food stamps.</p>
<p>The rest of your items need not seriously be addressed since your first 2 would effectivly stop anyone coming into the U.S. as those are the primary reasons and circumstances that bring so  many illegal 3rd worlders into the U.S. Deportation should be a ride to the nearest national boundary and put across it (to bad if it happens to be the 11 mile limit of california&rsquo;s shore)and NOT a comfortable plane ride to their own countries at tax payers expense</p>

			<p>Honestly, if we do not end illegal immigration and send back the illegals we are going to make a temporary undesirable situation permanent.</p>
<p>Consider that an illegal immigrant network has taken over. As immigrant workers persisted in certain vocations they brought their friends and relatives to fill vacancies as they occurred. As immigrants came to dominate entire sections of the workforce, the language and culture of the workplace changed in ways that made American workers out-of-place. Plus, employers used them to break unions and undercut American workers. </p>
<p>The results are that technology and productivity of immigrant-enclave jobs tend to be frozen, guaranteeing that dirty jobs get less and less attractive to Americans and effectively block 45 million poor Americans from ever getting off public assistance and doing that work. Work which they used to do right up through the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>America and its citizens lose out in many important ways: They are not able to compete directly with immigrant workers in the labor market resulting in soaring public social costs and greatly diminished tax revenue, higher prices for the goods produced by immigrant workers are passed on to the consumer because the industries preserved by them demand protection from imports, the national value system and culture are systematically displaced, etc&hellip; </p>
<p>Modern liberals want to keep the citizens of this country living in poverty to protect their base of power while they import foreigners to do jobs that tens of millions of American citizens living in poverty should be doing.</p>
<p>Neo-conservatives support the current status quo because of their desire for the lowest possible labor cost. Neither group aligns itself with what is best for the long-term national interest of the country and its citizens.</p>
<p>But Cicero&rsquo;s observation in 55 BC is the antithesis of the modern liberal position today:</p>
<p>&#8220;The national budget must be balanced. The public debt must be reduced; the arrogance of the authorities must be moderated and controlled. Payments to foreign governments must be reduced, if the nation doesn&rsquo;t want to go bankrupt. People must again learn to work, instead of living on public assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you removed the illegal immigrants the need is created allowing for able body citizens living in poverty or near poverty to be weaned from public assistance resulting in very desirable medium and long term economic outcomes for the United States economy. What would prevent the necessary reform from occuring would be to follow the modern liberal suggestion and make the problem permanent by offering a path to legal status.</p>
<p>We would like to also note as critical to this discussion that leaving things as they are permanently prevents the necessary reforms from occurring by way of how established immigrant networks keep out Americans from doing this work.</p>
<p>All sorts of possible solutions are available but an effective blackout of their discussion in the university setting and the media, by the modern liberals and neo-conservatives prevents the public from considering them.</p>
<p>For example, consider how wages in agriculture would increase if we were to raise grain exports to oil exporting countries. Instead of paying $143 a barrel of oil and chargine $7 a bushel, for example, we began to charge much more for grain exports. That alone is an interesting discussion.</p>
