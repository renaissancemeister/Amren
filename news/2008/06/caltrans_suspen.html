						<p>Caltrans has abruptly suspended its popular Adopt-A-Highway program several months after an anti-illegal immigration group sued the state agency for discrimination after it was forced to move its stretch of highway farther from a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint along Interstate 5 in San Diego County.</p>
<p>State transportation officials have decided to put pending Adopt-A-Highway permits on hold while they review guidelines for the program, which allows groups and individuals to clean litter from a designated stretch of state road in exchange for a highway sign featuring the name of the business or organization.</p>
<p>Existing permits will remain in effect as the state Office of Administrative Law reviews the program&rsquo;s rules, said Edward Cartagena, Caltrans spokesman for District 11, which covers San Diego and Imperial counties. He could not estimate how long that process might take; state officials say they will seek public comment on the evaluation of the 19-year-old program.</p>
<p>Caltrans suspended applications June 17, Cartagena said. The decision comes more than four months after the San Diego Minutemen filed a federal lawsuit against the state agency, accusing it of discrimination and violation of free speech after Caltrans moved the group&rsquo;s sign. Saying that the location south of San Clemente could draw protesters, Caltrans moved the Minutemen&rsquo;s piece of road to a less-trafficked spot on California 52 in eastern San Diego County near Santee.</p>
<p>The founder of the San Diego Minutemen, Jeff Schwilk, said Monday that the agency&rsquo;s decision follows his group&rsquo;s failed attempt to adopt a different part of Interstate 5 last month. Schwilk says Caltrans officials allowed Jobing.com the piece of road 4 to 6 miles south of the checkpoint even though that business applied for the spot later. The agency then offered them a different freeway in the &#8220;middle of nowhere,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Caltrans estimates that more than 120,000 people have helped tidy state thoroughfares. According to the agency website, &#8220;the Adopt-A-Highway program is not a forum for advertising or public discourse.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ironically, the Minuteman organizations in Arizona often spend days picking up trash left by illegal aliens who migrate through the desert.</p>
<p>In St. Louis, a certain convicted felon who called himself a leader of a certain white sheet group wanted to adopt a stretch of interstate in suburban St. Louis, that goes through an area that is virtually all-white.  The state rejected him, and the ACLU helped him push it through the courts, and he won.  So, in reaction, the state legislature officially named that stretch of I-55 from I-270 to Butler Hill Rd, the &#8220;Rosa Parks Freeway.&#8221;</p>
<p>What happened next is obvious.  The person never cleaned up the highway, he was picked up on a burglary warrant, is now in prison, so his &#8220;group&#8221; had their signs removed.  Yet, I-55 is still called &#8220;Rosa Parks Freeway,&#8221; and white commuters who live in Jefferson County to get away from black crime in St. Louis have to have that sign staring at them in the snoot every evening.</p>
<p>If states are going to pull these stunts, I would rather see them eliminate Adopt-a-Highway programs altogether.</p>

			<p>I wrote on another blog and it was not printed, that whatever gets in the way of the continuing massive State destroying illegal immigration in California, is NOT ALLOWED. There are too many reconquista politicians in office in California who constantly put pressure on any agency that will not do their will. The will to allow the takeover to continue. This is not some great revelation. Any open minded person who follows politics in California knows this. </p>

			<p>Caltrans this and Caltrans that. The article never gives spokesperson names. I`d like to know the ethnic makeup of the people making the choice to shut down. White folks going along to get along, or angry Hispanics striking back in the only way possible. Which group runs Caltrans nowadays?!? </p>

			<p>If Caltrans treated a minority group this way, there would be a massive civil rights lawsuit and demands for tens to hundreds of millions of US$ in damages. But, as this is only white men getting discriminated against, it is OK. Move along, there is nothing to see here&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>Yep, sounds more and more like South Africa everyday. I wonder when our Uhru (night of the long knives) is coming. The Uhru &#8216;movement&rsquo; is picking up steam in South Africa. Blacks wearing T-shirts and bumber stickers saying &#8220;The Uhru is coming soon&#8221;. White South Africans are facing genocide.</p>

			<p>Fine if they suspended the Adopt-A-Highway program!  Let the state pay Caltrans workers to pick up the trash others had been picking up for free.  Let&rsquo;s hope the delighted taxpayers remember this in November.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an Uhuru group in St. Petersburg, Florida that rioted a few years ago, burning structures and stoning white motorists.  (They spell the term &#8220;Uhuru,&#8221; which the msm claims means &#8220;freedom in Swahili.&#8221;  But the militancy of these criminals makes no mistake that &#8220;night of the knives&#8221; is far more apropos.</p>
<p>You can be sure the MSM never mentioned a word about the group having it&rsquo;s roots in Africa, nor did they even suggest what the word might mean, while they were reporting on the chaos.  They have since wrote a bit more about it.  Instead they encouraged the white folks there to roll over and played dead by electing a black criminal as police chief, which they obediently did, no doubt thinking that would solve the problem. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re asking for it and they&rsquo;re going to get it too.  The Uruhu movement are patiently spending their welfare checks, waiting for another excuse to have at it again.</p>
<p>It has never occurred to them to do what whites do when an area gets scarce on jobs, which is to move where the work is.  They would rather sit tight, then pounce at the opportune time, because rioting has been so successful for them in the past.</p>
