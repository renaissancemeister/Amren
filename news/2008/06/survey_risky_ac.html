						<p>Hispanic high school students use drugs and attempt suicide at higher rates than their black or white classmates, according to a new federal survey that shows a continuation of a disturbing trend.</p>
<p>The study is the latest in a series of surveys of U.S. high school students every two years. The new report noted that black and white students are reporting less sexual activity than in years past, but there was no decline among Hispanics.</p>
<p>In addition, Hispanic students were more likely than either blacks or whites to attempt suicide, ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, or use cocaine, heroin or ecstasy.</p>
<p>Hispanics also most often drank alcohol on school property, were offered or sold illegal drugs, and occasionally skipped school because they feared for their safety, according to the 2007 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Experts were unable to come up with an explanation for why Hispanic behavior trends differed. However, they speculated that school environments many Hispanics face may differ considerably from what adolescents of other races encounter. Earlier research found that Hispanics and blacks more commonly attend highly segregated schools than whites or Asians.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s tremendous segregation in our schools,&#8221; said Howell Wechsler, director of adolescent and school health for the CDC. He said he was very troubled Hispanic teens had not improved in certain risk areas at the same rate as blacks and whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One example: About 10 to 11 percent of Hispanic students said they attempted suicide, compared with around 7 percent of whites and 8 percent of blacks.</p>
<p>However, whites reported the highest rates of smoking and heavy drinking, while blacks reported the highest rates of obesity, violence and sexual activity.</p>
<p>One striking behavior in which blacks fared the worst was television watching.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the new report shows that about 63 percent of black students watch three or more hours a day. In contrast, 43 percent of Hispanic students and 27 percent of whites watched too much TV, the report concluded.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The survey also found that more blacks use computers for non-school activities   &mdash;   like video games   &mdash;   than whites or Hispanics.</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s findings may indicate that black children have fewer sporting events, social clubs or other after-school options than whites or Hispanics, said Ralph DiClemente, an Emory University researcher who has studied adolescent health and media exposure.</p>

					<p>Success! Being this survey is an exercise designed to give them a life skill they&rsquo;ll need for the rest of their lives - lying to white folks. It builds up racism awareness and a respect for their own vibrant cultures and heritage.</p>

Bush II did say &#8216;family values don&rsquo;t stop at the Rio Grande&rsquo;. He just never fully explained the range of hispanic family values.</p>
<p>I wonder how much money it&rsquo;s going to take to solve these problems.</p>

					<p>Blacks watch more television than any other ethnicity. Just what I thought. That is where they learn most of their opinions about Whitey.They constantly see White-tee, doing bad things to Black-kee, and since they cannot distinguish fantasy from reality, they go out and do hate crimes against White-tee in an effort to even the score.</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; or &#8220;Latino&#8221; is used as a racial word by so many ignorant or PC people. Hispanic was meant to describe something tied to Spain, Latino was meant to describe someone who speaks the beautiful Latin language of the Romans, and they should remain so. Doing otherwise is an insult to the West and great nation of Spain and its heroic people who brought Western European civilization to the New World for the first time. Let us call nonwhite Hispanics and Latinos for what they are&hellip;mestizo, mulatto, triracial, Afro-American Indian, or Native American. These words are no more offensive than calling somebody black or white. I am sure the Romans are rolling over in their graves and the white nations of Argentina and Uruguay and large white pocket regions of Chile and Brazil are having a fit over the idea of being lumped in with the mixed and non-white people in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, Honduras, etc </p>

					<p>Argentina and Chile are not White. Almost all Chileans are mestizos and with Argentines, it is pretty much the same. Chileans are about 20% Indian. Upper class = 15% Indian, lower class = 25% Indian. Argentina is about the same. A series of 97 Argentines found Indian in all of them, ranging from 1.7% to 83%.</p>

<p>I watched a lot of television as a kid too. Probably because I had &#8216;bad&rsquo; parents. Actually, I had bad parents. One thing I noticed is that it gives the viewer the idea that everything &#8216;out there&rsquo; is better. In my case it really was. Even the dog I have now who sees the TV thinks &#8216;the real world&rsquo; outside is vastly more exciting. </p>
<p>Entertainment is in serious need of reform in our country. In many ways we can be proud (even it it&rsquo;s not always that good for you we are still the best at it!). <span class="caps">PBS, </span>infected by liberalism as it is too, is the way to go. Funny how hardly anyone chooses to watch it. I don&rsquo;t very often. That&rsquo;s just how things go, isn&rsquo;t it, and one of the reasons it needs reformed?<br>

<p><br>
If these &#8220;experts&#8221; weren&rsquo;t wilfully blind liberal twits and Raza apologists, they&rsquo;d see that the explanation is right in front of their faces: It&rsquo;s the IQ Gap, stupid! </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not smart enough to avoid <span class="caps">OBVIOUS </span>danger, you will succumb to it. So if mestizo teens are getting in trouble and exposing themselves to these <span class="caps">OBVIOUS </span>risks, and getting themselves needlessly killed in dumb ways, it only proves what &#8220;The Godfather&#8221; author Mario Puzo said in one of his book titles: &#8220;FOOLS <span class="caps">DIE</span>&#8221;<br>

					<p>What I&rsquo;d love to know is the answer to a couple of burning questions like: <span class="caps">WHO </span>funds these useless &#8216;surveys&rsquo; and &#8216;studies?&rsquo; What intellectual flyweight actually <span class="caps">BELIEVES </span>the rubbish turned up in these &#8216;well-researched&rsquo; studies? Do these studies actually <span class="caps">MEAN </span>anything other than keeping another fool busy with make-work for a few weeks or months?</p>
<p>That minority youths (Blacks, Hispanics) are more prone to crime and other behavioral problems is pretty much like claiming the Pacific Ocean holds many gallons of water! </p>
<p>The &#8216;expert&rsquo; writing this &#8216;study&rsquo; would have been better advised to <span class="caps">COUNT </span>how many motor vehicle accidents, nation-wide, were caused by Hispanics under the influence of alcohol or drugs. To count how many Hispanic births were ultimately <span class="caps">PAID FOR</span> BY <span class="caps">WHITE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS </span>across the width and depth of our nation. Or to count how many crimes were perpetrated by Hispanics within the same geographic boundaries. At least answers to <span class="caps">THOSE </span>questions would have some real significance and meaning.</p>

<p>Time to do your research. Argentina, like Uruguay, is vastly white and one of the safest and richest nations in South America ( I doubt that is a coincidence). Chile is at least 25% European.</p>

					<p>Isn&rsquo;t this racist to suggest that Mestizo students do worse when they &#8220;hang out&#8221; with eachother in Mestizo schools?</p>
<p>There are whites of European origin in Argentina,Chile, etc as in German, Welsh, Irish, Italian, etc.as in no mixed races.</p>
<p>That is who runs the countries largley.</p>

<p>I agree too many people watch television.  I remember a very intelligent friend of mine was attempting to debate me with what he had learned on television.  Of course I told him that I didn&rsquo;t think he was carrying of capable of carrying on a serious debate solely based on what he had seen on <span class="caps">TV.</span></p>
<p>Look at the nomination process in both parties.  It wasn&rsquo;t about the issues it was about who had better television coverage.</p>
<p>Hardly anyone nowadays bothers to argue about a candidate based on what he has actually read or that persons congressional record.  Its all about what that person has seen on <span class="caps">TV.</span></p>
<p>Although we have access to more information than any people that has come before us most us for some inexplicable reason chose to live in an information wasteland.</p>

					<p>Well, go look it up on Wikipedia. A recent study looked at 97 arbitrarily chosen Argentines and found Indian blood in all of them. It ranged from 1.7% to 83%. This implies that almost all Argentines have at least some Indian blood in them. The average Argentine is 79% White, 18% Indian and 3% Black.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, almost all Chileans are mestizos. The rich are 85% White, 15% Indian and the lower class are 75% White, 25% Indian = averages.</p>
<p>In both of those countries, the lighter-skinned folks refer to themselves as &#8220;White&#8221;. You need to understand what &#8220;White&#8221; means  in Latin America. It&rsquo;s just not the same as &#8220;White&#8221; in the <span class="caps">US.</span> Latin America is a mestizo continent. That Argentina and Chile are &#8220;White nations&#8221; is one of the biggest White nationalist lies of all.</p>
<p>Do some research.</p>

					<p>Did you notice that it said <i>attempted</i> suicide, rather than <i>committed</i> suicide?  That&rsquo;s because Mexican girls like to feign suicide attempts as dramatic gestures with no intention of actually killing themselves.  Really.  </p>
<p>If their dad won&rsquo;t let them do something they want to do or their boyfriend dumps them, they take a dozen over-the-counter pills and then &#8220;faint&#8221; in front of their family or friends.  The anguished family/audience has to take the girl to the emergency room to get her stomach pumped and then they all have a dramatic story to tell over and over and over.  &#8220;Aye, my baby!  All over that no good boy!&#8221;  Trust me, I&rsquo;ve been bored to tears by many of these stories.  </p>
<p>Latino culture tends to value drama queens and overwrought &#8220;romantic&#8221; gestures to an astonishing degree.  Families are always embroiled in feuds and scandals that would put American soap operas to shame.  They really enjoy high drama even when it plays heck with their lives!  It&rsquo;s sick how the women revel in being the center of attention as they go on and on complaining about their abusive boyfriends - they sort of glow as they talk about being slapped, cheated on or stolen from.  It&rsquo;s like they think it makes them important. </p>
<p>The first few times I was around this melodrama culture, I thought it was just some bad apples or a random dysfunctional family.  But I was just naive; the more familiar you are with mestizos, the more you realize they <span class="caps">LOVE </span>drama.  I find it revolting.  </p>

					<p>&#8220;Well, go look it up on Wikipedia. A recent study looked at 97 arbitrarily chosen Argentines and found Indian blood in all of them. It ranged from 1.7% to 83%. This implies that almost all Argentines have at least some Indian blood in them. The average Argentine is 79% White, 18% Indian and 3% Black.&#8221;</p>
<p>You got your information from the wrong place, because nowhere on Wikipedia does it state that. Here&rsquo;s what it says:</p>
<p>Citizens of European descent make up the great majority of the population, with estimates varying from white 89.7%<sup class="footnote"><a href="/news/2008/06/survey_risky_ac.html#fn47">47</a></sup> to 97%<sup class="footnote"><a href="/news/2008/06/survey_risky_ac.html#fn48">48</a></sup> of the total population. The last national census, based on self-ascription, indicated a similar figure.<sup class="footnote"><a href="/news/2008/06/survey_risky_ac.html#fn49">49</a></sup><br>
A study conducted by Argentine, Swedish and North American institutions, established that the genetic average structure of the Argentine population, contains 79.9% of European contribution,<sup class="footnote"><a href="/news/2008/06/survey_risky_ac.html#fn50">50</a></sup> whereas the Amerindian admixture, though not fully visible in physical appearance, was estimated to be present in a high percentage of the population, close to 56% on either paternal or maternal lineages, of which just 10% were shown to have Amerindian ancestors on both lineages.<sup class="footnote"><a href="/news/2008/06/survey_risky_ac.html#fn51">51</a></sup><br><br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>In other words, 44% of the population there does not have any Native American ancestry and the percentage that does barely has any. A significant portion of <span class="caps">U.S. </span>whites has mixed ancestry and it&rsquo;s not visible, but most of us would consider them white since they look and act white. It seems you go by the one drop rule and would say a person of European heritage who is 1% not white is not white. That would exclude a lot of people from the white category. As somebody once said if it looks, walks, and sounds like a duck, it is a duck.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to Wikipedia, almost all Chileans are mestizos. The rich are 85% White, 15% Indian and the lower class are 75% White, 25% Indian = averages.&#8221;</p>
<p>No. On Wikipedia, it says: </p>
<p>Chile&rsquo;s ethnic structure can be classified as 30% white, 5% Native American and 65% predominantly white mestizos.<sup class="footnote"><a href="/news/2008/06/survey_risky_ac.html#fn44">44</a></sup></p>
<p>Do some research. Try citing directly instead of constructing numbers and trying to insult the large numbers of wonderful European people struggling to uphold peace and success in the few predominantly European regions of South America where crime and violence have not become common.</p>

					<p>Here you go. <a href="https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2006/12/genetic-components-of-argentinean.html" rel="nofollow">A series of 94 Argentines</a> found Indian blood in all of them, ranging from 1.7% to 83%. </p>
<p>My Chilean link is dead now. You obviously have no understanding of social race in Latin America. White down there simply does mean the same as White up here. White down there means &#8220;looks White&#8221; and often these people do have some Indian in them. </p>
<p><a href="" rel="nofollow">This study</a> found that Uruguayans in one city were 31% Indian, almost all on the mothers&rsquo; side. Other studies found around 7.5% Indian and about 10% Black in the average Uruguayans. The only reason Uruguayans, Chileans and Argentines get called White is because they are &#8220;Whiter&#8221; than the rest of Latin America.</p>
<p>My understanding about Chile is that pure Whites are not that common and most folks have some small amount of Indian blood. </p>
<p>You need to do some research on &#8220;social race&#8221;. Just because a Latin American say he is White doesn&rsquo;t mean a hill of beans.</p>
