						<p>Both violent and property crimes declined in 2007 from the previous year, nationally and in most of Connecticut&rsquo;s largest cities, the FBI reported Monday. But one expert warned the figures could mask rising murder rates among young black men.</p>
<p>In preliminary figures for crimes reported to police, the bureau said the number of violent crimes declined by 1.4 percent from 2006, reversing two years of rising violent crime numbers. Violent crime had climbed 1.9 percent in 2006 and 2.3 percent in 2005, alarming federal and local officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because the FBI preliminary figures do not contain the detailed age, race and gender breakdowns available in the final report later in the year, they may unintentionally mask a growing murder rate among black male teenagers and young adults, particularly with guns, said James Alan Fox, professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t be fooled into thinking our problems are over,&rdquo; Fox said. He pointed out that from 2002 to 2006 the rate of murder committed by black male teens rose 52 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violence is down among whites of all ages and both genders; it&rsquo;s up among black males, not black females,&rdquo; Fox said. &ldquo;When you blend all the national numbers together you fail to see this divergence. There are many more whites in the population, so their decline can dwarf the increase among young black males.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you see a crime spike in a city, it&rsquo;s very often attributable to young black males attacking other young black males,&rdquo; Blumstein said. &ldquo;The duration depends on how fast the city reacts, and the big cities have more resources and more sophistication about how to respond.&rdquo;<br>

<p>This is why I always say, when it comes to blacks, it&rsquo;s damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>One group wants to hide racial numbers so the public doesn&rsquo;t see the true numbers of black crime. The second group wants these numbers to be made public in the hope that people will see blacks as victims. The same game is played with <span class="caps">AIDS, </span>single parents, school performance, etc.</p>
<p>I take the position that you can&rsquo;t begin to solve a problem unless you know all the facts; that includes race.</p>
<p>Too many ongoing problems are being left unaddressed and unsolved because too many people are afraid to speak the truth. What we get are endless theories and excuses that neither explain or solve anything.<br>

<p>And what&rsquo;s going to change that?  Midnight basketball?  Giving each of them a hundred thousand dollars so they can make a video for Youtube showing them stuffing the bills in their mouths?</p>
<p>What is going to be attempted that hasn&rsquo;t already been tried before?  I mean besides coming down hard on them and letting the world know that blacks do not belong in a civilized society?</p>
<p>There will be no improvement in the future, because genes can&rsquo;t be changed.  The only &#8220;Change&#8221; we are going to see is what we have been seeing all along:  A &#8220;Change&#8221; for the worse.</p>
<p>Is that what the Obamanation means when he snidely refers to &#8220;Change?&#8221;</p>

					<p>You can be sure that the media will never report this! It&rsquo;s not in keeping with their agenda: &#8220;prove&#8221; that Whites are evil racists.</p>

&#8220;figures&#8221;&hellip;&#8221;may unintentionally mask a growing murder rate among black male teenagers and young adults,&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unintentional&#8221;? This outrage is in no way &#8220;unintentional&#8221;.  That has been the intent ever since the &#8220;news&#8221;  began terrorizing all elements of the society, no matter what their race, by concealing &#8220;Black&#8221; crime.</p>
<p>In a more enlightened and less superstitious era, published crime news statistics  always made the distinction between that of the Whites and that of the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; simply because of the disparity of crimes and types of crimes committed by the two demographic groups. Today&rsquo;s politicized Government &#8220;news&#8221; reports are worse than useless because they fail to tell the public anything. They are, in fact, very dangerous.</p>
<p>This is especially true regarding the White woman, who, while a known target of &#8220;Black&#8221; males, she herself is kept in ignorance. The periodic &#8220;wilding&#8221; by &#8220;Black&#8221; mobs targeting Whites is concealed whenever possible by the phony &#8220;news&#8221; reportage  being foisted on the public is another example.  The kiddies being awarded &#8220;extra points&#8221; for the random killing of a White in order to get into their &#8220;youth organizations&#8221; is yet another, and one could go on and on.</p>
<p>The &#8220;news&#8221; though, all of a sudden becomes concerned when its phony reporting &#8220;Unintentionally&#8221; might cause harm to &#8220;Black&#8221; youth. Its too bad they are not as concerned about the damage they are intentionally doing to the White community.</p>

					<blockquote>But one expert warned the figures could mask rising murder rates among young black men.</blockquote>
<p>Hmm &hellip; aren&rsquo;t we always being told that race doesn&rsquo;t exist, that it&rsquo;s a social construct?</p>
<p>Why should anybody care about rising murder rates among young black men? How do we even know they&rsquo;re black? Shouldn&rsquo;t we just be worried about the murders of individuals, and be concerned with murder victims one victim at a time?</p>
<p>Liberals, academics, leftists, activists, multiculturalists &hellip; they contradict themselves all the time; they constantly tell everybody not to worry about race and then they worry about it constantly.</p>

					<p>&#8221; I have a dream&#8221; Someday American society, even the mind numbed liberals, are going to awake, and say, we have a real problem here with our black citizens and their lack of responsibilty and lack of morals, we&rsquo;ve covered up for them long enough, made every kind of excuse for their behavior, given them special treatment, racial preferences, and they still act like uncivilized miscreants.</p>

					<p>The real story is even worse than what is reported: Federal crime figures for Whites are inaccurately skewed upward because crimes committed by Hispanics and mestizos are counted as crimes committed by Whites.  An exception to this practice is made, of course, in the reporting for &#8220;hate crimes,&#8221; in which Hispanics are a victim group but not a perpetrator group.</p>

					<p>With a majority of young black males living in an environment which is constantly being punctuated by drugs, brutality, and gangster rap, should anyone possessing a  modicum of intelligence be surprised that young black males often kill each other? </p>
<p>Perhaps one explanation is that the African - Americans simply do not know the difference be virtual reality and reality. Hint: Grand Theft Auto is a simulation; a bullet in the brain pan is not!</p>

					<p>&#8220;Violent crime had climbed 1.9 percent in 2006 and 2.3 percent in 2005, alarming federal and local officials&hellip;.<br>
&hellip;.from 2002 to 2006 the rate of murder committed by black male teens rose 52 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>So a, one-year, 2.3% general increase is &#8220;alarming federal and local officials&#8221;&hellip; but the fact that this increase is almost entirely due to a surge in extreme violence committed by a group that represents only 7%-9% of the general population remains &#8220;masked&#8221;?</p>

					<p>This data simply reiterates what almost everyone has long since become aware - decades of government welfare doles and <span class="caps">LMSM </span>excuse propaganda has caused black social structure to completely crumble, causing a majority of sullen and righteously resentful (they think) young black men to drop from school into the streets and join the generations of black gangbangers and career criminals who came there before them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a system all its own - one incubated by the left and still passionately supported by them.</p>

					<p>Red diaper grandbaby Blumstein must be looking for a million dollar federal grant to &#8220;study&#8221; the problem.</p>
<p>Foregone conclusion.  It&rsquo;s all the fault of the working class white christians who were driven out of the city by blacks.</p>

					<p>The environment blacks grow up in might well be punctuated by drugs, brutality and gangster rap, MoMo, but who is responsible for creating this set of circumstances?  Blacks themselves.  It certainly isn&rsquo;t whites from the suburbs travelling to black neighborhoods to distribute drugs and commit driveby shootings.</p>

					<p>The mainstream newsmedia&rsquo;s deafening silence on black crime (especially against Whites, never considered a hate crime by the way) is like the old story of the first-mate&rsquo;s ship-diary, &#8216;the Captain was <span class="caps">SOBER </span>today&rsquo;. The  unspoken implication being that the captain is usually drunk.</p>
