<h1><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/10/news/UN-GEN-UN-Britain-Monarchy.php">Britain Rejects Call by UN Rights Body for Vote on Monarchy, Written Constitution</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britain is dismissing the idea of holding a referendum on whether it should ditch the monarchy in favor of a written constitution.</p>
<p>The U.N. Human Rights Council offers the suggestion as part of a review of Britain&rsquo;s rights record.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Britain says in a statement Tuesday there is no popular demand for a vote on a written constitution. It says Prime Minister Gordon Brown&rsquo;s government considers the queen vital to Britain&rsquo;s unity, and supports keeping her as head of state.<br>

			<p>No they don&rsquo;t have anything more important to worry about.  We forget sometimes how many people across the planet are actively or reflexively engaged in the total annihilation of white culture.  There is no detail too small that the socialist multi-culturalist white traitors and the activist from the non-white races don&rsquo;t want to expunge it from the history of the world.  There are many people out there who would gladly destroy western civilization &#8220;and live off ditch water&#8221;, as another AMRENER posted recently, if they could destroy the last of us white devils. </p>
<p>So no they will never stop until every statue, every book, every city, every nation, every flag, everyone of us is destroyed.  But do not fear, we aren&rsquo;t dead yet.  Read your history.  There is a reason that we dominated so much of the world for so long.  This never ending series of attacks from &#8220;random crime&#8221;, to endless PC lawsuits, to government betrayal is starting to wake people up.   Our ancestors had to fight for every step forward they made as a people and we will soon all be called upon to fight again for every thing we hold.  Life is hard, only those who are willing to fight for what they have deserve to keep it.  Our generation has been called let us pray we have what it takes. </p>

			<p>  I think we should be voting to abolish the United Nations. I honestly can&rsquo;t remember the U.N. doing anything that contributed to the better good of everybody. I only see where they have been a detriment to the majority of us. For God&rsquo;s sake, abolish the United Nations, it is a waste, and a very expensive one at that. The united nations serve nobody except those it wishes to pander to.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about this is the extent to which the actual military/industrial might of whites has increased.  All indicators are pointing to another world war, this one based on race.  A war which whites are doing everything in our power to avoid but which people of color are increasingly determined to bring to us, at ANY cost.  Although they are aided and abetted in the short term by race traitors and temporarily elected officials, this is nothing new&hellip;.and never lasts.</p>
<p>Once whites have awakened and finally had enough, certain other races are going to be royally screwed.  Because of the downright evil involved, there will be zero reason or inclination for white restraint.  Although they outnumber us, they are far outmatched by us in power.  More to the point, they are completely dependent.  The war will be short, I think.  Tremendous, widescale destruction of their populations followed by ethnic cleansing from the western world.  Finally, the white world will simply turn its back on the third world.  Without us, there will be a MASSIVE die off of their populations (95%+) due to frank starvation.  Aid of the type we give now will probably be illegal&hellip;..as will most forms of contact with the third world.</p>
<p>This is already happening to a certain extent.  If anyone missed the fact that flights from the Congo are no longer allowed many places.  And suddenly, food aid is starting to be considered &#8220;too expensive&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Interesting that Saudi Arabia and Cuba pressed for this in the UN, both obviously with impeccable human rights records.<br>
Notice that the UN did not call for the abolishment of the Royal House of Saud?<br>
Being Islamic might have something to do with it!</p>
<p>Also Resolution 7/19 on &#8220;Combating Defamation of Religions&#8221; was adopted by the UNHRC. So now it is illegal to criticise Islam, but NOT of course Christianity or Judaism!<br>
The Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) now holds sway at the UNHRC.</p>

			<p>A written British constitution sounds good, but who would write it?  The same people who are flooding the nation with Africans and subcontinentals?</p>
<p>The most likely result of a written British constitution would be the effective repeal of the Magna Charta.</p>

			<p>I agree, get rid of the U.N. Every time a Balkan or African country breaks into a half dozen NEW countries they quickly join the U.N. and have just that many more votes to determine where OUR money goes. Is it any wonder so much of the money the U.S. supplies to the U.N. goes to Africa?? Someone must have some financial info on how much of the U.N. budget the U.S. supports, ANYBODY?? </p>

			<p>Enough, you make excellent points.<br>
 My only fear is that having pretty much destroyed the Christian ethic in so much of the West that we could have a problem reviving our energy and determination to be successful  It is, imho, Christianity that has driven Europeans to acheive so much, in spite of the interference from the various church bodies over the centuries. The reason I say this is because, Christianity alone of all religions, (bar Judaism to a certain extent) is a religion that encourages us to seek &#8216;God&rsquo; or &#8216;the truth&rsquo; or &#8216;the creator&rsquo;etc. Other religions, fine as some are,  Buddism, Taoism,Hinduism &amp; Islam don&rsquo;t seek truth, they contemplate or they accept unquestioningly. As Marxism has eliminated the search for truth, (IT, the State, is the truth- ie . it KNOWS there is no &#8216;god&rsquo; or whatever), so we stop searching, we can see the downgrading in our schools,immorality and hedonism spreading throughout our culture.</p>
<p>Anyway you see  my point, I hope, (I&rsquo;m a bit convoluted!). It doesnt matter whether one beleives about Jesus and all his deeds, so much as the fact that Christian religious upbringing inspires us to see further, seek explanations, how do things work, why, is &#8220;god&rsquo; behind them, if not then what?. Thats how science developed and so European success. Just something to think about.<br>

			<p>Racial survival for both one&rsquo;s lineage and future progeny along with preservation of homelands(s), heritage, language, beliefs, achievements and thus ethnic identity should be more than sufficient grounds for any ethnicity to want to fight to the death in defence of.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of fighting the extreme struggle for survival, has always been to banish the invader(s) or be prepared to utterly destroy one&rsquo;s own territory by every and any measure necessary, to ensure the invader(s) and one&rsquo;s treasonist enablers of them suffer the effects of annihilation too.</p>
<p>There is no driving force so strong as a need for retribution upon one&rsquo;s enemies.</p>
<p>The pursuit of that goal should be sufficient motive in itself.<br>

			<p>Maybe it is time the British held a referendum on whether to remain members of the UN. I think I can predict the outcome already &hellip; </p>
<p>The Americans could also hold a referendum, and the Canadians, the Australians, the New Zealanders &hellip; </p>
<p>The UN should remember as part of its &#8220;review of Britain&rsquo;s humans rights record&#8221; that without the sacrifices made by vast numbers of British servicemen (and civilians), human rights would be in far shorter supply worldwide than they are today.</p>

<p>The destroy white civilization movement is not led by non whites.  It is led by white elites who think that once they have destroyed the competition (other whites) they will rule the world forever.</p>
<p>So Saudi Arabia is a leader in this movement.  Prince Charles has been absolutely groveling to them for decades.  Wonder what will happen to him if the monarchy  is abolished.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of a long propaganda campaign, somethiing like the anti segration campaign in the US.  In a few decades there will be so many non white anti british voters in England that it will be put to a vote and the monarchy will be established in favor of a muslim caliphate.</p>
<p>And what will happen to all the white hating, white civilization british feminazis then.?????</p>

			<p>The leftists/Marxists in England have been pushing for a written constitution for some time.  They see in America how a written constitution can be twisted and used to destroy normality in society - using unelected judges to work against the will of the people.  The British left will convienently leave out things like our first and second amendment and put in all sorts of leftist jibberish that will easily by used to counter the wishes of the people.</p>
