<h1>Jobs for Teens Hard to Find</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robin Erb, Detroit Free Press, June 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Metro Detroit teens might find plenty of opportunities to volunteer this summer, but landing a paid job will not be as easy. And many area employers say teens who have not applied for jobs yet have even slimmer hopes of gainful employment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The competition for jobs comes not only from adult workers who have lost jobs, but also from those 55 to 70 who are punching checkout registers and bagging groceries to supplement their retirement. And in some states, immigrant workers also are filling jobs traditionally held by teens.</p>
<p>Teen employment has been falling since 2006, Sum said. Particularly hard hit is the Midwest and the country&rsquo;s urban cores, Sum said.</p>

			<p>Well excuse me&hellip; but those of us Americans with even a modicum of reasoning ability have been preaching this for years&hellip; That immigrants STEAL jobs that previously were the ideal for working mothers   &mdash;   wanting to work those hours their kids were in school. For American teenagers&hellip; learning how to accept job responsibility while earning money for school and college. That underskilled, under-educated Blacks as well as White Americans were being crowded out of the job market. Now we can read this truth in the newspapers! Maybe we anti-immigration protesters had it right after all.</p>

			<p>Many multiculturalists and liberals who are in favor of massive immigration from 3rd world countries easily forget that these immigrants won´t just stay at one place and do nothing. They will compete with Americans for scarce jobs. It is one thing to be in favor of immigration and not to experience them moving into your neighborhood. But it is another thing to have them occupying the job you have applied for. Liberals barely thing that they or their children might have lost potential jobs due to immigrants.</p>

			<p>Alot of teen summer jobs and even traditional college summer jobs are going to illegals.  This is extremely bad for our future.</p>

			<p>Just about any fast food restaurant around where I live is staffed by illegal immigrants.  I have to drive into the deep suburbs of Connecticut to find a burger joint with white teenagers behind the counter.  I wonder how long their jobs will last.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t have access to the citizenship status of a corporate employee of a local fast food chain, but on the rare occasion I do frequent these businesses, there are plenty of middle-to-retirement aged foreign employees working these simple service jobs. Sure, plenty of them are friendly and thank you for your business in a heavy accent, but it makes me wonder why we are importing and employing individuals who at that stage in life have nothing better to offer to society than a kid out of school for the summer. </p>

			<p>Here in New Orleans 95% of the convenience stores and small corner food stores are owned and operated by Vietnamese and a few middle easterners. </p>
<p>These stores accept foodstamps (an electronic &#8220;Louisiana Purchase&#8221; card) and thus sell enormous quantities of junk food to low-IQ blacks, who do not seem to even realize the irony of the situation. </p>
<p>An interesting thing I&rsquo;ve noticed happening though is that a lot of 2nd generation Viet and arab kids, who were born in the US and who are perfectly bilingual, seem to idolize the black underclass, and imitate their ways and their speech. The parents are straight out of an Apocalypse now village but the kids identify with the black ghetto style. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because these Asian kids are so obviously higher-IG than the Africans they serve in their parents&rsquo; corner stores, (a LOT higher), but here in Uptown New Orleans you hear the youngsters talking in ebonics, even though they have genetics to be doctors and scientists. </p>
<p>As always, it&rsquo;s amazing how clueless the blacks are, when in their own neighborhoods where they&rsquo;ve been for perhaps 300 years, these brand-new  newcomers from the other side of the planet take over the local stores to sell them chips and malt liquour.  </p>

			<p>I actually had a white teenage girl at the drive though at the local burger joint recently. It was nice to see a friendly american, who spoke english and got the order right for a change. When I was in high school  20 years ago, all of these places were staffed mostly by american teens or some retirees. It was a right of passage to have your first job at a burger joint or something. Many boys got construction jobs. God, how times have changed. Everybody at the burger place or the construction site is all mexican. I can tell you from experience, americans did a much better job, they actually got the orders right.</p>

			<p>As our manufacturing jobs continue to be relocated to communist China (trading with the enemy) the number of jobs available in America diminishes proportionality, yet Washington continues to let in an annual flood of millions of legal and illegal aliens to steal the few remaining available jobs.  </p>
<p>The first thing we can do is boycott businesses that employ foreigners and write or email those companies management teams that betray the American worker.  Stand in front of these bastions of treason and hand out addressed flyers to approaching customers and ask them to send them in if they support American employment for American citizens over aliens.</p>
<p>If that fails then escalate to physical actions.  I&rsquo;m sure anyone can figure out simple ways to hit those businesses in the pocketbook and continue doing so relentlessly until they capitulate&hellip;<br>

			<p>Michael Zweig in his 2004 publication &#8216;What&rsquo;s Class Got to do With It, American Society in the Twenty-first Century&rsquo; asserts that poverty in the United States is cyclical in nature with roughly 12% to 15% living below the federal poverty line at any given point in time, and roughly 40% falling below the poverty line at some time within a 10 year time span. </p>
<p>Though 40% of Americans cycle in and out of poverty in any given 10 year period, modern liberals want to import workers from foreign nations to do jobs that Americans historically performed and would be doing if they were empowered to do so and not kept down by a codependent idology on public assistance. Everything from agriculture, small businesses, engineering, nursing, teaching, etc&hellip; the list is almost endless of what Americans are willing to do if the need is created by ceasing to rely on foreigners and Americans are empowered with the opportunity while being weaned off public assistance.</p>
<p>Complicating matters is the immigrant network that eventually took over. As immigrant workers persisted in certain vocations they brought their friends and relatives to fill vacancies as they occurred. As immigrants came to dominate entire sections of the workforce, the language and culture of the workplace changed in ways that made American workers out-of-place. Plus, employers used them to break unions and undercut American workers. </p>
<p>Modern liberals want to keep the citizens of this country living in poverty to protect their base of power while they import foreigners to do jobs that tens of millions of American citizens living in poverty should be doing.</p>
<p>Neo-conservatives support the current status quo because of their desire for the lowest possible labor cost. Neither group aligns itself with what is best for the long-term national interest of the country and its citizens.</p>
<p>The real danger is that this situation could be made permanent unless the illegals are sent home.<br>

			<p>&#8220;That immigrants STEAL jobs&#8221;</p>
<p>However, I have to place the major portion of the blame on AMERICANS WHO HIRE THEM for the cheaper labor. If not for these greedy, traitor americans, this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. These americans sell their own country down the river for a fast buck.</p>

			<p>To &#8220;KC&#8221; let me say: You are right, of course! But I stand by my statement. Remember: your children, grandchildren and THEIR children and grandchildren will be competing with the offspring of today&rsquo;s legal OR ILLEGAL immigrants for available jobs.</p>
<p>Sadly, not every person can make it as a middle-class management type, as bank director, lawyer, physician or dentist. Which raises the question: With so many manufacturing and customer representative and service jobs OUTSOURCED to people overseas&hellip; WHAT JOBS WILL BE AVAILABLE for our non-White-collar descendants? Note I am NOT worried about myself, being about to retire&hellip; but I am not so dulled by age I can&rsquo;t see, interpret and reason. Someone, be it a group of people or an assembly of business and corporate leaders&hellip; are out to ELIMINATE OUR AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS! That class of people between poverty-level and the wealthy elite that came into the picture after WWII.</p>

<p>&#8220;newcomers from the other side of the planet take over the stores to sell them chips and malt liquor&#8221;,,,</p>
<p> You would think the blacks would open up stores to serve their own community where (presumably) they would have loyal customers. But it doesn&rsquo;t happen. Its usually Orientals or Arabs who are the merchants to black &#8216;hoods. I remember seeing some Spike Lee movie where these black guys are standing around watching these Koreans surveying some corner lot and the blacks are talking derogatively about them. About how the Koreans will be running the store in a few years. It never seemed to occur to these blacks to try to beat them to the punch. The success of Orientals only highlights black failure, probably why they don&rsquo;t like them.</p>
