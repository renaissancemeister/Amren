						<p>Tougher immigration policies launched in President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s first year in office are working, with more illegal migrants expelled and more skilled workers let in, France&rsquo;s immigration minister said on Thursday.</p>
<p>France has said harmonising immigration policies at EU level was one of its priorities for its six-month presidency of the bloc that starts on July 1, and the ruling UMP party said the data released on Thursday should help it persuade EU partners.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hortefeux [Immigration Minister Brice Hortefeux] said 14,660 illegal migrants were expelled from France in the first five months of the year, up 80 percent compared with the same period in 2007.</p>
<p>In the 12 months to May 2008, Sarkozy&rsquo;s first year in office, almost 30,000 illegal migrants were expelled, up 31 percent year-on-year, Hortefeux said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s expulsions target is 26,000, which Hortefeux said he was confident would be reached.</p>
<p>Another target set by Sarkozy was to increase the proportion of economic migrants, as opposed to those arriving to join relatives, to 50 percent of new arrivals from 7 percent now.</p>
<p>Hortefeux said he was on course to achieve that goal, with 30,710 skilled workers allowed into the country in the 12 months to May 31, up 36 percent compared with the previous 12 months.</p>

			<p>Bravo. But I find it intriguing and disturbing that our MSM has failed to inform us of these expulsions, as they failed to do so about the Italian razings, etc. Golly gee, I wonder what&rsquo;s up with that. Could they fear that White Americans might rise in similar protest??</p>

			<p>It seems like Sarkozy&rsquo;s only expelling illegals to make it look like he&rsquo;s hard on immigration.  If he were more serious, he would set his goals higher without letting in these &#8220;skilled workers.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in the meantime, how many were let IN?   Ah, we&rsquo;re not told that crucial figure!  The number expelled is meaningless without also giving the number imported.</p>

<p>This is just juggling figures.  I don&rsquo;t care  if they&rsquo;re family immigrants or economic immigrants or what.  To a WN, that is irrelevant.  The one overriding fact is that they are HERE.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming clearer than ever that Sarkozy was promoted by the media and business as a tough guy and the would-be savior of France just to stave off LePen from getting into office, and in order to keep the invasion going.  All the while acting like he&rsquo;s stopping it!</p>

<p>Excuse my gross ignorance, but wasn&rsquo;t this how the whole mess STARTED:<br>
Predominantly-white countries began importing hordes of non-white, mostly dirt-poor &#8220;economic immigrants&#8221; in the various decades after the Second World War - those nations that &#8216;had&rsquo; empires (United Kingdom, France etc) looked to their former charges (the non-white - as opposed to white - &#8220;colonies&#8221;) for &#8220;economic immigrants&#8221;, while Germany had to make do with Turks, the United States with their Mexican chums, even my beloved New Zealand felt a burning need to import Pacific Islanders (economic growth and all that!). Once immigration enforcement had been reduced to tatters by bureacracy, &#8220;racial advocacy groups&#8221; and sheer negligence, the illegals followed their &#8220;working brethren&#8221; to the new lands of milk and honey.</p>
<p>This is just another example of government window-dressing.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s long overdue. They should have never made the mistake of letting them in to begin with. Mistakes are costly, they say - and sometimes deadly.</p>

In reality,  he was never&#8221; hard on immigration.&#8221;  As the some of an immigrant himself, how could he be?  He&rsquo;s all for it!  He just wanted to get better control over it and to curtail ILLEGAL immigration.  He never claimed to be opposed to immigration per se, nor wanted to stop it.   Many French  voters were taken in.   Just as here, it&rsquo;s so easy  for the press to confuse the public mind about  immigration vs. illegal aliens.  Many people assume the two are the same.</p>

			<p>Only massive deportations of LEGAL immigrants will save France.  Deport anyone convicted of a felony and everyone that came in on that visa and maybe they can turn it around but they clearly lack the will.  Paris will resemble Detroit in 10-15 more years.  You can&rsquo;t even walk at night and soon you will not be able to walk at all or take the subway.</p>

<p>They are the same. At least to me. Admittedly, the legal immigrant is more frightening, but the end result is the same. I want them both stopped (legal and illegal immigration). <br>

			<p>Good job, France! But aren&rsquo;t you a little late on that?  I mean, at least 20% of your population is unemployed, hates the natives there, is violent, and deadset on takin over your country.  Not only that, most French (and most Europeans, for that matter) care more about socialism or &#8220;not offending people&#8221; than working hard and having nationaal pride</p>

			<p>Hmmm, I wonder how many of those immigrants expelled were white eastern Europeans? I am betting a fair proportion, with a small fraction being non white. It is all in how you report. &#8220;There are lies, damn lies, then there are statistics&#8221;. I agree with most here that it is all window dressing. All the while the non white population of France grows. PC has such a grip on western societies, it is as if we have a death warrant for our own race. Sigh!</p>

			<p>How interestting that France is having problems with immigrants.<br>
Here in Canada, our French-speaking province of Quebec is the only province which has its own official immigration policy and has come under fire for not being accomodating enough to Muslims; a small Quebec town has issued a code of conduct that Muslims consider discriminatory. </p>
<p>Canada is seeing a revival of old resentment over non-White immigration and newcomers arriving here, (most of which are from caribbean or Asian nations). There has been a notable spike in violent crime in our major cities and now. controversial Afro-centric schools have been approved and launched in Toronto. </p>
<p>Could it be a percursor to full-blown racial tensions not seen in Canada&rsquo;s largest city since the 1970&rsquo;s? Race is now just starting to become a focus of discussion  &mdash;  and not all of it is polite. The biggest concern over it comes from the political Left, and this summer or the next few summers could see a grim situation taker shape if this dialogue does not continue.  </p>

			<p>Sarkozy is the son of an immigrant family.  There is no way he&rsquo;s opposed to immigration. He just wants to get a handle on it. As others have said, this is all window dressing. Meanwhile, the immigration goes on.</p>

			<p>No way are the N African Muslims 20% of France&rsquo;s population. But they are 10% for sure, and that is way way way too many. France needs to just block off that whole N African group and import way way fewer of them and be way way more selective about the ones that they bring in. I suspect that a lot of the N Africans are coming on family reunification insanity. Why do Western countries even have that? If I take off to go live in a foreign land, I assume I am kissing my family of birth goodbye. Maybe I&rsquo;ll come visit once in a while? Maybe they will come see me? But based on what ultra-arrogant right am I able to demand that my new country import not only me but my entire extended family?! The arrogance of these new immigrants seems to know no limits.</p>
<p>You KNOW that lots of these problem Mesoamerican immigrants are coming in on family reunification idiocy. That whole program needs a major revamp, or just get rid of it.</p>

			<p>Comparisons between France&rsquo;s North Africans and America&rsquo;s Mexicans are valid only up to a point. The major difference is that the Mexicans lack a distinctive religion of their own to give them the sense of serving a holy cause and telling them that they are superior to the infidels around them. The Mexicans who come here do not have the swaggering arrogance and superiority complex of the Moslems in France. In other words, the Mexicans lack an ideology.   Hence, the Moslems would seem to be the greater threat.</p>

			<p>In reply to Robert Lindsay, it is a strange fact that France &#8216;officially curtailed&rsquo; mass immigration way back in 1974 as a consequence of the first oil shock and economic slow down.<br>
   But the vast majority of non-White immigrants have arrived after that date. - This is down to &#8216;family reunification&rsquo;.</p>
