											<p>
							<i>AP, June 3, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Brigitte Bardot was convicted Tuesday of provoking discrimination and racial hatred for writing that Muslims are destroying France.</p>
<p>A Paris court also handed down a $23,325 fine against the former screen siren and animal rights campaigner. The court also ordered Bardot to pay $1,555 in damages to MRAP.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A leading French anti-racism group known as MRAP filed a lawsuit last year over a letter she sent to then-Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy. The remarks were published in her foundation&rsquo;s quarterly journal.</p>
<p>In the December 2006 letter to Sarkozy, now the president, Bardot said France is &#8220;tired of being led by the nose by this population that is destroying us, destroying our country by imposing its acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bardot, 73, was referring to the Muslim feast of Aid el-Kebir, celebrated by slaughtering sheep.</p>
<p>French anti-racism laws prevent inciting hatred and discrimination on racial or religious or racial grounds. {snip}</p>

			<p>France is really in trouble.  Free speech is not allowed and speaking the truth can get you into trouble.  The French government claims that their is no scientific basis for race.  How far will the intellectual slide go?  France is the epicenter of self-destructive socialist belief and behavior.  And yet there are some number of French who resist this - Brigitte Bardot is one of them.  Even if she is a leftist come to her senses, I wish her the best.</p>

			<p>Basically, she was fined for expressing an opinion. I&rsquo;ll assume she is financially ok, but most AR posters would probably agree that if not, we should help her pay. You can rent her 1950s &amp; 60s movies at Netflix. Not always good films, but her beauty was overwhelming in every frame.</p>

			<p>Like if it was much better here in the U.S.</p>
<p>For those who still wonder whom to blame for this quick disappearance of free speech, try to find the common denominator between the predominantly white countries that went on that path of muting inconvenient dissidents (and I don&rsquo;t mean here the Gore&rsquo;s &#8220;inconvenient truth&#8221; nonsense).<br>

			<p>As opposed to the non-existant &#8220;rtacial hatred laws&#8221; that ban riots and rampant cultural violence&hellip;hmmph. Maybe if they would stand up against this invasion more often their reputation would be different&hellip;but the fact remains that even in America where we are also guilty of not drawing a line the french are often viewed as weak&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;French anti-racism laws prevent inciting hatred and discrimination on racial or religious or racial grounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>So stating ones opinion, in a private correspondence no less, can now be considered to be &#8220;inciting hatred&#8221; in France? I wonder if they consider muslum terrorists who kill innocent men, women and children infidels, to be inciting racial hatred?</p>

<p>That part of it may be the worst. Judgements like this are made specifically to inflict psychological torment on the convicted. Few things sting worse than giving aid to your enemy; except being FORCED to give aid to your enemy by your own government.<br>
It would be no different in terms of psychological cruelty if Twaana Brawley [sp?] were forced to pay an extra fine to American Renaissance.<br>
It may be only for hygienic reasons that they no longer use the guillotine in that country.</p>

			<p>This is stupid.  Islam is a religion not a race. There are white muslims.  This is a cutural issue, it correlates with race as all religions do, but strictly speaking this is not a racist comment.  NOr in my opinion does it reflect a bigoted attitude, its simply the truth.</p>

I used to be sad that I was getting old, now the prospect of dying of old age soon does not seem that bad.  <br>
I truly feel sorry for anyone under 50, your lives will be a holy hell someday soon. I truly am sorry..</p>

			<p>This is too bizarre. Provoking discrimination and racial hatred? If France is anything like the USA, for every racial statement made by someone like Bardot, there are 99 other statements made against France and whites. Provoking discrimination and racial hatred against whites is business as usual. Making racial statements against whites and France is considered higher learning. At least that&rsquo;s how it works in the USA.  </p>

			<p>Note how many more things are called &#8220;hate&#8221; speech these days.  Now  speaking truths like blacks having lower intelligence or greater explosive athletic ability will get you named at least a hater, and at worst a racist.  We are moving ever closer to criminalizing speech here in America; that is, speech directed at anyone but whites.  Vilifying whites is all the rage in our institutions, academia, and the media.  Disgusting, pure and simple.</p>
<p>Camp of the Saints is coming true.  I hope we someday FIGHT this insanity.  It is truly the world turned upside down.</p>

			<p>The European mentality&hellip; leading to Bardot&rsquo;s conviction seems to be: If you PRETEND the crime and social problems caused by immigrants don&rsquo;t exist&hellip; they won&rsquo;t happen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Welcome to the real world! Crime and social problems by immigrants are very palpable and real. Ever since an &#8216;enlightened Europe&rsquo; stupidly started admitting the world&rsquo;s human trash into their respective nations, crime rose in parallel with the influx of third-world non-White immigrants. Blame it on third-world thinking! These lesser humans are simply too different, too far outside what passes as a normal culture to fit into a White nation. Does anyone recall those stories about Muslims raping White Swedish women. Considering them &#8216;whores fit only for rape&rsquo; because native Swedes saw no reason to follow the Quran-prescribed Muslim dress code.</p>
<p>The more Muslims, Africans, Pakistanis, Hindus and Turks these nations admit, the sooner they will descend into third-world chaos and destruction. That will be the inevtiable legacy of post-World War II &#8220;enlightenment!&#8221; So sorry, French government officials. Hiding your head, telling each other there is no immigrant crime, no immigrant-caused problems will NOT solve your nation&rsquo;s problems. The ONLY SOLUTION is one French leaders apparently lack the manhood to employ. To expel all non-White immigrants for the good of France, the good of European nations as a whole.</p>
<p>We have relatives in Europe. Speak with them via phone from time to time. Read the local papers via the Internet. Crime, crime, and still more crime&hellip; seems to be the gift to the indigenous White population of this misguided liberal thinking. Nor will all the denialist thinking by officials ever change that bitter truth!</p>

<p>In the good old days Joseph Stalin sent people to prison camps in Siberia for expressing opinions.</p>
<p>In France they only fine them.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s called DENIAL. The idea being that by pretending an [immigrant] problem does not exist, you don&rsquo;t HAVE a problem. By inference, we can thus surmise Europe is virtually crime-free. That those many crimes of all kinds we keep hearing about&hellip; DID NOT REALLY HAPPEN! Apparently the various victims were either delusional or simply claiming to be victims&hellip; hoping to put these fine Muslims, Africans, Asiatics in a bad light.</p>
<p>French officials apparently could be considered certifiably insane, based on the verdict handed down by this kangaroo court.</p>

<p>What hammer does the Islamic states hold over the nations of the Wset?  Is it nuclear blackmail or economic blackmail or nothing more than good old fashioned treason by Western politicians willing to sell us out for Islamic money?  It can&rsquo;t be oil blackmail, because if it were the West could depolulate the OPEC states in a heartbeat and simply take their oil.  Of course we would have to imprison the management of the Western oil companies first since they are the ones pulling OPEC&rsquo;s strings and driving up oil prices&hellip; </p>

			<p>The heart of France&rsquo;s malaise is the French admiration<br>

and theoretical the speechifying is..the more admirable.<br>
Its gotten to the point that there is no such thing as<br>
simple &#8220;truth&#8221; anymore. If Bardot had published a 30 page<br>
academic treatise saying the same things..i.e. Islamic culture <br>
undermines France..she would have had no problems.</p>

<p>NOT TRUE! NOT TRUE AT ALL!!</p>
<p>The free world is destroying the free world, because the freedom that is being daily taken from it by its enemies,is not challenged. The day is almost here, when it will be impossible to challenge it. The founding fathers of this nation warned in many of their writings about the neccessity of remaining vigilant and constantly challenging those who would take freedom away. So far Americans have been failing pitifully.</p>

			<p>Someone or some entity is trying to control White Peoples&rsquo; Civilizations, I see the white peoples world getting smaller and smaller, I see this as more of a global problem than a local one. Somehow and someway we need to get organized. The biggest obsticles we have in the world today are the indoctrinations of the educational institutions, the political institutions and the law enforcement agencies. You&rsquo;ve got to know that all of these institutions are against us. We are in a figurative prison now; and shortly we will find ourselves in a literal one.</p>

			<p>Bardot has gone where few European-American Christians will&hellip;speaking freely and courageously for years about the planned destruction of her nation through outrageous open-borders policies that reward totally unassimilable immigrants from cultures with no history of women&rsquo;s rights and individual freedom as they enter and destroy her nation and virtually every Western nation   &mdash;   all of whose immigration laws changed in the mid 60s. </p>
<p>She has been tried and convicted repeatedly for hate speech, that is telling the truth.  B&rsquo;nai Brith has punished her for embodying the spirit of truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the end times, the men shall be as women, and the women as men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you, my Sister, for sacrificing yourself to awaken others.</p>

			<p><i>Can someone please post or tell me where to find the original article about the letter Ms Bardot wrote to Mr Sarkozy which got her in so much trouble. I say she DID NOT print it in her magazine and others say she did. Thanks in advance and I will be checking back.<i></i></i></p>

Now, what the heck is THAT supposed to mean?   <br>
No, I do NOT wish that they suffer &#8220;the same fate&#8221; as their predecessors!</p>
<p>Whose side are you on, anyway?</p>
<p>Vive la France!  And vive la Bardot!</p>
