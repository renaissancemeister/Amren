<p>A new black consciousness is emerging in France, lately hastened by, of all things, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States. An article in Le Monde a few days ago described how Obama is &#8220;stirring up high hopes&#8221; among blacks here. Even seeing the word &#8220;noir&#8221; (&#8220;black&#8221;) in a French newspaper was an occasion for surprise until recently.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this past weekend, 60 cars were burned and some 50 young people scuffled with police and firemen, injuring several of them, in a poor minority suburb of Vitry-le-François, in the Marne region of northeast France.</p>

			<p>A lot of voters are viewing Obama with hope. I wonder what the hope is? Could it be hope that if you raise a mixed race child, and the father abandons it, even if the father leaves the entire country, he could grow up to be president, and marry a beautiful, articulate, black woman. </p>

			<p> &#8220;But in reality we&rsquo;re blind in France, not colorblind but information blind, and just saying people are equal doesn&rsquo;t make them equal.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t and saying that there&rsquo;s no such thing as race is just as stupid.</p>
<p>The entire West is bogged down with blacks who are prone to crime, have a propensity for violence and troublemaking, and are so dimwitted they can&rsquo;t seem to do anything above menial labor, which they don&rsquo;t like doing really. If they can&rsquo;t get something for nothing, most of them give every indication of preferring to turn to crime rather than work.</p>
<p>Expecting something for nothing by an Obama presidency, blacks all over the world are dropping all pretenses of being unbiased, and they&rsquo;re stating outright they will vote for him if they&rsquo;re in the US, or support him if they are not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been known to a large portion of whites that race trumps everything for blacks no matter where in the world they might be, but this blind support of Obamanation is still really amazing to behold.</p>
<p>Whatever white racism still exists in the world it pales greatly in comparison to black racism.  They&rsquo;re not even trying to hide it anymore.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that if this man is elected we will see them celebrating as if they have just conquered the entire white world and expect to be in full charge from now on.</p>

			<p>And we were told that race doesn&rsquo;t matter (or even that it doesn&rsquo;t exist). We were also told that blacks can&rsquo;t be racist, but how can you explain their joy if you reject the idea that they like Obama because his race is the same as theirs?</p>

I wonder how the French will blame Ms Bardot for this. I pissed a lot of people on myspace by saying that i am preparing for the coming elections by buying more ammo and weapons for the upcoming riots for <br>
1) the nationwide spread of the Katrina N.O. fiasco<br>
2) the riots if Obama is not elected<br>
3) the JUBILANT riots if Obama IS elected<br>
4) the riots if Obama is accused of responsibility for problems<br>
5) the riots of proof showing Obama IS responsible for problems</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting experiment.  Imagine if France or Germany had its election, and country elected a black President or Chancellor.  Other countries, including the US, would reevaluate the country downward.  That is exactly what will happen to the US in the eyes of Europe, Oceania, and Asia if Obama is elected:  we are going to reassessed, and we are going to be seen as a weak and lost country on the decline.  And if you think the barbarians are at the gates right now, wait until 2009 or 2010.  I think it&rsquo;s fairly possible that we will be the subject of military attack and invasion in the next 10 years.  Think about it:  a weakened, embarassed military; a weakened dollar; a weakened, oil-dependant economy; and an inexperienced, possibily unintelligent leader that foreign nations do not respect.  That&rsquo;s the perfect storm.     </p>

			<p>I would like to point out that the young men burning cars at night in France are by and large Caucasians from North Africa = Arabs, and not Blacks. Blacks are causing a lot of crime in France relative to their numbers, but the real mess in France is being caused by N African Arabs, principally from Algeria.</p>

<p>Europe is already in decline&hellip;America is the only nation in the West still standing on its foundation&hellip;.and the forces pushing Obama have the same plan to turn the US of A into a full blown socialist cess pool to bring it on par with the rest of the world&hellip;. that&rsquo;s why BarryO is their politically correct candidate&hellip;&hellip;people would not fall for a white guy spewing socialist hogwash&hellip;..you should know that he also has a Dutch adviser who prefers him over McCain and the Republicans.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What business do blacks have being in France?&#8221;</p>
<p>There have been blacks in France since the Renaissance (slaves) the first blacks in France were brought against their will in French colonies. Know Alexandre Dumas (the author of the Three Musketeers)? Well, his father was a mulatoo&hellip; So the initial black presence in France was initiated by French THEMSELVES, if you have a problem with that, take your complaints to the slave traders who brought balck slaves in French territories.</p>
<p>&#8220;The entire West is bogged down with blacks who are prone to crime, have a propensity for violence and troublemaking, and are so dimwitted they can&rsquo;t seem to do anything above menial labor, which they don&rsquo;t like doing really.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ranger, google Africans and model minority. African immigrants are THE MOST educated immigrant group in the USA, more educated than Asia immigrants according to the 2000 census! What you have said applies only to urban inner city African-Americans. If Blacks were so dim-witted, African immigrants would not be the most educated immigrant group in the US! And no, most of these AFrican immigrants are NOT Caucasoids from South-Africa or North-Africa, but from 99% black countries such as Nigeria&hellip; </p>
<p>And you talk about things you know nothing off, in France, blacks are still more liked than people from Turkey, North-Africa etc which in the US you consider to be Caucasoid. In surveys there are twice more people who say they don&rsquo;t like arabs than people who say they don&rsquo;t like blacks.</p>
<p>Just because that&rsquo;s what happens in your country (blacks being most disliked) doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the same everywhere.</p>

<p>  Yes the Italian football team is still Italian, while the French team is African. </p>
<p>I think that a President Obama will act as an immigration magnet for Africans from all over the world. In addition, he will embolden European blacks to demand more &#8220;rights&#8221;, more privileges, and more representation. This is what contemporary American has come to represent to the world  &mdash;  not freedom, but radical, Communist/Jacobin like equality.</p>

<p>It will probably be China that invades us.  Don&rsquo;t forget, Obama&rsquo;s Father may have been a child suppport evader and green card bigamist, but his Mother and the grandparents who raised him were hard, hard core leftists.</p>
<p>How else do you think a high school boy could have met the head of the communist party in Hawaii, Frank Davis?  Introduced by the lefty grandparents.</p>
<p>Stop blaming the blacks for Obama.  It is the White communists who raised him and put him where he is today.</p>
<p>He is nothing more than a puppet of George Soros.</p>

			<p>Some people are constructive. Other people are destructive. A look around at the great civilisations white European societies have created &amp; the lack of civilisations blacks have created plus their behaviour in almost every white country they&rsquo;ve moved to shows that whites have a much greater preponderance of the former &amp; blacks a much greater preponderance of the latter.</p>
<p>No amount of academic brainwashing can alter this simple fact.</p>

Oh, I&rsquo;m sure they won&rsquo;t have much problem.  Obviously, her &#8220;racism&#8221; has so offended and traumatized the oppressed youths that they have no choice but to express their  grievances in this way.   This isn&rsquo;t rioting;  it&rsquo;s just legitimate political expression.  (If it were right-wingers or whites, THEN it would be rioting and the troops would be called in.)</p>

Correct. But they are still Africans   &mdash;   in this case <b>North </b> Africans.   Many or most of them  are racially indeterminate mulattoes  of  varying degrees of admixture.  But they identify themselves as &#8220;Africans&#8221; and feel common cause with other Africans.  And other Africans identify with them.   They are all aligned against the common enemy: the European whites. </p>
<p>Most of us would not consider them &#8220;white&#8221;   &mdash;    although there are SOME of them  (just some) who appear to be completely white.  Those North African countries, after centuries of importation of slaves (from everywhere),  are completely scrambled   &mdash;   even worse than Brazil    &mdash;   and Islam is a religion that by its nature encourages miscegenation and discourages racial identities.  The Moslems&rsquo;  common bond is in their religion, not  their race.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I think  Dmytro Kornilov summed it up very neatly:   France&rsquo;s &#8220;dark-skinned thugs&#8221; are  a &#8220;combination of European leftism, Islamic extremism, and the American ghetto.&#8221;    Well said!  I believe that, more and more, the trashy influence of the American ghetto is being felt there   &mdash;   the entire ghetto  culture is being idolized: the movies, the rap, the  swaggering (anti-)social attitudes.   Of course, one could argue that Obama is in no way a product of the American ghetto    &mdash;   quite the opposite!   &mdash;   but that fact in France is irrelevant. He is  seen by them as black (or, better said, &#8220;non-white&#8221;) and THAT is all that counts.  He is OTHER THAN white. He is one of them.</p>

<p> Get real. I seriously doubt one black in France in a hundred can trace his/her heritage there before WW2. Nice try at historical revisionism there, but no goal. Because Marco Polo was in China in the middle ages, does that give China a White &#8220;heritage&#8221;?</p>

			<p>2:57 PM: It is clear that N African are genetically and racially mostly Caucasian. Even Glayde Whitney recognizes this clear and obvious truth, as does Coon and every other racialist author. Globally, they are about 13% Black and 87% White or Caucasian. The Caucasian is usually Berber, and these people are the original Caucasian that gave birth to all of us Whites. There are some N Africans and N African groups (Kabilyes in Algeria) that are as White as Germans or other Europeans. So some N Africans are genetically European Whites but most are not. But it&rsquo;s not correct to call them mixed up Mestizos. This is obviously a mostly Caucasian or mostly White group.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in France, they are hostile to European Whites, and that is all that matters, not their genetics. I&rsquo;m not sure how they feel about African Blacks. Many Arabs really hate Black ppl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear to me that even genetically White folks who adopt this radical version of Islam can be regarded as the enemies or Euro White civilization. France being a case in point. Genetics or anthropology being largely irrelevant.</p>
<p>11:30 AM: It is clear to me that genetically and anthropologically, Persians must be lumped in with Europeans. They are Aryans. N Africans are a Caucasian subrace, but some are phenotypically very European looking. There are quite a few Arabs who look completely White. Look at President Assad of Syria. He&rsquo;s completely European. There are some Pakistanis that are phenotypically almost indistinguishable from Europeans. The Kalash as a case in point. You might want to check out some of your White brothers and sisters across the globe. We are a wide ranging people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you want to race-split, but phenotypically, it&rsquo;s hard to make a case that the only Whites are in Europe. </p>

			<p>&#8220;If Blacks were so dim-witted, African immigrants would not be the most educated immigrant group in the US! And no, most of these AFrican immigrants are NOT Caucasoids from South-Africa or North-Africa, but from 99% black countries such as Nigeria&hellip;&#8221; French</p>
<p>  Most of us know that there are intelligent blacks. Some on average are even more intelligent than whites. Many but not all are of mixed race like Senator Obama. These black intellectuals are the so called &#8220;talented tenth&#8221; of W.E.B Du Bois. Unfortunately, it is the other ninety percent that caused Dr. Du Bois and the rest of us so much trouble and concern. As far as Africa goes, I fear the elite of Africa (doctors, scientists, engineers) are leaving the continent and will cause Africa to not only never advance but to actually revert to an earlier more primitive stage of civilization.  </p>

			<p>       The average Iranian isn&rsquo;t very Persian. They are a dark,<br>
hairy, stocky people. As in India, the Aryans were a warrior <br>
elite and their stock has become mixed through the ages until<br>
almost no real Persians are left. The Parsis of India, who were<br>
emmigrants from Persia, show more of it as did the Shah.</p>

			<p>2:57 PM: It is clear that N African are genetically and racially mostly Caucasian. Even Glayde Whitney recognizes this clear and obvious truth, as does Coon and every other racialist author. Globally, they are about 13% Black and 87% White or Caucasian. The Caucasian is usually Berber, and these people are the original Caucasian that gave birth to all of us Whites. There are some N Africans and N African groups (Kabilyes in Algeria) that are as White as Germans or other Europeans. So some N Africans are genetically European Whites but most are not. But it&rsquo;s not correct to call them mixed up Mestizos. This is obviously a mostly Caucasian or mostly White group.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in France, they are hostile to European Whites, and that is all that matters, not their genetics. I&rsquo;m not sure how they feel about African Blacks. Many Arabs really hate Black ppl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear to me that even genetically White folks who adopt this radical version of Islam can be regarded as the enemies or Euro White civilization. France being a case in point. Genetics or anthropology being largely irrelevant.</p>
<p>11:30 AM: It is clear to me that genetically and anthropologically, Persians must be lumped in with Europeans. They are Aryans. N Africans are a Caucasian subrace, but some are phenotypically very European looking. There are quite a few Arabs who look completely White. Look at President Assad of Syria. He&rsquo;s completely European. There are some Pakistanis that are phenotypically almost indistinguishable from Europeans. The Kalash as a case in point. You might want to check out some of your White brothers and sisters across the globe. We are a wide ranging people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you want to race-split, but phenotypically, it&rsquo;s hard to make a case that the only Whites are in Europe.</p>

<p>Good spin, but fear is something so amazing when you feel the clock is ticking on you.</p>

			<p> &#8220;African immigrants are THE MOST educated immigrant group in the USA, more educated than Asia immigrants according to the 2000 census!&#8221;<br>
French</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
Well, as we all know, statistics can say  whatever you want them to say.  And it also depends who is quoting them.  Thus, Africans are supposedly the most educated group,  ACCORDING TO THE  AFRICANS!  (The United African Organization). And that is only in terms of who those who have high school diplomas.</p>
<p>Immigrant Africans Push for Recognition, Services - NAM <br>
<i> United African Organization, a partnership of 20 African immigrant communities, held a summit at the DuSable Museum of African American History. &hellip;Alie Kabba, executive director of UAO, who came to Chicago from Sierra Leone in 1991,  said they are the most educated immigrant group in metropolitan Chicago and nationally.  According to 2000 U.S. Census data, 95.4 percent of African immigrants who had entered metropolitan Chicago in the past 10 years had a high school degree or more, compared to 39.1 percent of Latin American immigrants, 73.8 percent of European immigrants and 85.3 percent of Asian immigrants . </i></p>
<p>But on the other hand, according to India News, Indians are the best educated. India News Online.  <a href="http://www.indianembassy.org/inews/February99/abcd.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianembassy.org/inews/February99/abcd.html</a></p>
<p>Also, do note that Africans do not claim to be the best educated group in the USA but ONLY the best educated IMMIGRANT group that is coming here.  When you consider the backward, Third World countries that the US is currently getting its immigrants from, out of that assortment it doesn&rsquo;t take too much to be considered the best educated.  Therefore, it&rsquo;s a feeble boast at best, even if true.<br>
