<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/education/article4220467.ece">White Children Most Likely to Be Bullied</a></h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joanna Sugden, London Times, June 26, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White children are much more likely to be bullied than any other ethnic group &mdash; reversing racial stereotypes surrounding playground abuse, Government research indicates.</p>
<p>Two thirds of children from white families say they had been bullied in the last three years but less than half of children of Indian origin make the same assertion.</p>
<p>Anti-bullying campaigners say white children are now in the minority in some areas raising their chances of being bullied.</p>
<p>Claude Knights, director of anti-bullying charity Kidscape, said:&#8221;More and more we&rsquo;re hearing that in some cities it isn&rsquo;t the usual isolation of ethnic groups, suddenly we have got statistics that show we have got a larger number of white young people being bullied.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some cities there&rsquo;s a dislocation of certain white children. So many cultures around them are being celebrated but where&rsquo;s their place? There&rsquo;s been such an attempt that you don&rsquo;t forget what has come in to the system that what was there already has been forgotten.&#8221; This isolation makes children feel &#8220;different&#8221; she said, and was likely to lead to them being bullied.</p>
<p>Six in ten children of black Caribbean origin said they had experienced bullying in the last three years, according to research into 16-year-olds by the Department for Children Schools and Families(DCSF). The results indicated that 58 per cent of children from Pakistani backgrounds and 54 per cent of those with Bangladeshi roots had been victims of bullies.</p>
<p>Louise Burfitt-Dons, founder of the charity Act Against Bullying, which cut ties with Jade Goody after allegations of racist bullying against Indian actress Shilpa Shetty on Big Brother, said: &#8220;Normally all you hear about is bullying with racial groups being discriminated against.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites are becoming more aggressive than they used to be as a result of trying to intergrate into a new society norm that is so aggressive. They have changed the way they behave in order to survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study also found that boys are just as likely to be bullied as girls but as many as eight in ten children with a disability that affects their school life said they had suffered at the hands of bullies in the last three years.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the DCSF said: &#8220;We have given teachers and heads the powers and support they need to prevent and tackle bullying. But bullying is a challenge we must all face up to and we need the support of teachers, heads, parents, young people and bystanders. It is important that children and young people who experience bullying speak out and do not suffer in silence.&#8221;<br>

			<p>I was born and raised in the UK, although I now live in the US.  My memories of early childhood are some of the fondest of my life: my entire elementary school was a collage of smiling and happy white English children.  Almost everyone was well behaved (and even the &#8220;bad&#8221; kids were only just a little mischevious) and the notion of violence was unheard of.</p>
<p>I am sickened by the downward turn that the UK has taken the past 50 years.  We were once a proud, great and civilized nation.  Why do we permit these foreigners to come into our land and treat us with contempt?  Why do we need our civilized culture sullied by their violence and aggression?  </p>

			<p>As long as I live I`ll never forget the day racial bullying walked in the double doors of our High School and flew right out the window shortly there after. Our South Central Texas  school was 98% White. I should more correctly say only 2% Black. If that. And Hardy Lee was its new champion of intimidation and verbal harrasment of insecure and racially unawares suburban White childen.<br>
  Hardy was a dead ringer for Cassius Clay. More in physical size and in manner of speech than anything else. His forte, if I remember correctly, was holding a small pocket knife up to the throats of his daily victims just long enough to make them late for class. <br>
 Then one day like an Alan Ladd movie, he came to town. He, was Steve Moore. A small boy from the country who looked like he was forty. That always amazed more more than what happened next. The guy was fifteen and bald for Pete`s sake. And smoked Malboro like a middleaged Brake Check mechanic. The word had flared around school he was not a guy to mess with. Maybe it was it after school welding job. <br>
  The place of the showdown was right inside the courtyard doors of the 300(Math) wing. I guess in retrospect Hardy had heard the rumours of the new  tough kid too. He walked up to Mr. Moore with his opening banter of  physical threats and mocking comment. Steve Moore laughed it all off with a bemused look of annoyance followed by a complete ignoring of the threat. Laugh?!?! At Hardy?!?  I guess it was that which threw Hardy off his game plan. Hardy pulled out his knife and Steve grabbed his hand and brought it back down to Hardys beltline while holding it there. Confused, Hardy stammered out the following, &#8220;Hey White boy! Where did you get the stupid looking hat?&#8221;  The hat was a Stetson and ringed with the sweat of a teenager who had to learn the realities of work on his fathers farm starting at the age of of seven. &#8220;You like my hat?&#8221;, Steve replied </p>

			<p>&#8220;It is important that children and young people who experience bullying speak out and do not suffer in silence.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Like millions of White children in America and Europe for a very long time. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked for years in Child Services and Addiction Centers with mostly Whites (which is how I always wanted it).  My concern with Whites is that they get right with their families.<br>
There may be a genetic component to addiction and we welcome the studies in that regard. But make no mistake about it, we systematcially train people to be addicts.  Abuse and neglect are not just wrong (though that ought to be enough) they are flat out stupid. Being beaten up does not make you tougher. That&rsquo;s what competitive sports are for. What are we animals?<br>
Being beaten and neglected and THEM blamed!!!! turns you into a criminal or a floor mat or somewhere in between.<br>
It&rsquo;s a cycle and it CAN be broken. <br>
But what tears me up is the case, I see them so often, of a beautiful White child, just filled with potential, being knocked around one second by their parent or parents or brothers and even sisters in some cases, and then ignored the next - only to later get the same treatment at school, and later at work, from some Black person.<br>
Whites ought to stop yapping about how dumb Black people are and get right with themselves first.  It&rsquo;s time to clean up our own side of the street - and fast.</p>

			<p>Blacks are already bullied and we&rsquo;re the majority.  Maybe it&rsquo;ll take us to be a minority or having a black president to give us our backbone back</p>

			<p>60% for Blacks and 66% for whites isn&rsquo;t a huge difference. And lets not forget that minorities are still a tiny fraction of Britain&rsquo;s population. Whites getting bullied are probably overwhelmingly bullied by other whites.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong,there are white bullies in the schools. The problem is that white bully victims are getting it both ways. When whites bully, they almost always bully fellow whites, when blacks bully, they almost always bully whites. I know from personal experience when I was in school. Also, blacks are far more likely than whites to  commit violence in schools and to bully in greater numbers and more frequently.</p>

			<p>I went to four elementary schools, two junior high schools, and three high schools. Forced bussing all the way. Bootcamp was easy after growing up in that environment. But it was SUMMER CAMP compared to what the new batch of white kids go through in the Los Angeles Unified School District.</p>
<p>As of 2007, students of Los Angeles Unified School District were predominantly Hispanic (73%) and African-American (11%), 9% were White. </p>
<p>Ouch!</p>

			<p>So the government is catching on to what I have experienced from the time of three years old in California - I am 56.  I know of so many Black or Latino on White bullying cases over the past 40 years I can&rsquo;t even put a number.  My wife was harassed in high school by a Black boy who kept breaking into her locker, just to scare her.  A Black gang invaded the school, beating up everyone White they could get their hands on.  This was 1979.  She finally got her parents to get her into a private high school.  Just before I met her, she was almost abducted by a carful of Latinos in San Mateo, California while she was walking to work one morning.  She managed to hide behind a building until they gave up on finding her.  I could go on and on, beatings, intimidations, county fairs that are no longer nice places to go. etc., etc., etc!  So the government has noticed - something?</p>

<p>I think we&rsquo;re about the same age and I know exactly what you mean.</p>
<p>Many of our towns and cities are ruined but there are still surprisingly large areas of the country where children can grow up in non-violent and civilised communities not significantly different from the 1950s. It&rsquo;s the non-mobile, urban whites who are the biggest victims in all this - as usual.</p>
<p>How long can the civilised parts survive - I&rsquo;d say 50 years max.</p>

			<p>I remember being bullied very well, and my parents telling me that fighting didn&rsquo;t solve anything. I also learned (by myself) that whacking a bigger bully in the back of the head with a board out of ambush a few times, and a few good head whacks while he was down pretty much brought the bullying to a stop. It also got word around not to try bullying on me. </p>

<p>Amongst adults, non-whites are about 10% of the population but amongst school age children, the numbers are far far higher. Consider</p>
<p>&#8220;More than half of all babies born in London last year were the children of foreign-born mothers. Across England and Wales, the figure was approaching a quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&#8220;A further six per cent had British-born mothers but foreign-born fathers.&#8221;</p>
<p>from</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1559489/Immigration-is-changing-rural-England-life.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1559489/Immigration-is-changing-rural-England-life.html</a></p>
<p>Certainly, some of those babies are from white immigrants, but even more of the babies born to non-foreign born mothers are the babies of 2nd or 3rd generation blacks and Asians.</p>
<p>Whites are already a minority of children in London&rsquo;s schools, many other large English cities are not far off.</p>
<p>From</p>
<p><a href="/pdfdir/fertility1207.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/fertility1207.pdf</a></p>
<p>&#8220;While the average age of those in White ethnic groups was 40 years in 2001, the corresponding ages of those in Black, Asian and Mixed ethnic groups were 31, 29 and 21 years respectively&#8221;</p>

			<p>The minority kids have picked up the authorities&rsquo; hatred for Whites and are acting it out. Nothing will happen to the bullies, because Whites are good only as sacrificial lambs on the altar of political correctness.<br>

			<p>What is the definition of bullying used here?</p>
<p>A black would count being called racial slurs as being bullied, while vicious assaults on whites would be minimised to the status of a single, isolated school fight.</p>
<p>Just look at the Jena 6!  Going by the MSM reporting the blacks were apparently the bullied ones and just frustrated with it!  So a &#8220;schoolyard fight&#8221; developed in which 6 blacks decided to sucker punch then kick and stomp a student on the ground.</p>

<p>The way it is here in the United States.  </p>
<p>No, whites that are getting bullied are not probably overwhelmingly bullied by other whites.  The since of entitlements by blacks to bullied whites students have been in place for at least 50 years, that I know.</p>
<p>There are many problems facing poor whites, but their stories are not championed by school boards, politicians, churches or by any special counsel to any state governor.  We need to have avenues that champion white children in all public discourse.  </p>
<p>Groups with ties to powerful organizations are able to spread racial propaganda though public and private schools.  This teaching is coupled with field trips to museums that advocate a shock and awe history lesson of the Jim Crow era.  Kindergartners and school students of all ages attend this type of school field trip.  Don&rsquo;t forget history month for blacks and other minorities.  Top it off with several black and minority special events taking place throughout the school year that pays tribute to heroes that put an end (an almost end since there is always work to be done) to blacks and minority suffering caused by whites and I will say the setting for black and minority on white bulling is prime.  </p>
<p>How do children handle racial confrontation while walking through school halls, or lining up to play a game of basketball in a city park, or lining up at the water fountain on a hot day during recess?  Even with a low percentage of black and minority students in a school with white students the white student will be bullied, because the school presents a curriculum that institutionalizes black and minority student entitlements over white students.  <br>

			<p>Good for you Skip. Thanks for sharing. I got ambushed once on my way to the store by a gang and knocked unconscious, thrown in the bushes, and left for dead. Fortunately I woke up about 11 PM at night and made my way home. I was in the third grade. They were much older. At school the next day they all looked surprised to see me sitting in class. True story. Welcome to LA.  </p>

			<p>To Irene at 10:49 AM: &#8220;&hellip;white students will be bullied, because the school presents a curriculum that institutionalizes black students entitlment over over white students.&#8221; White student will be bullied because most likely he or she won&rsquo;t fight back. And it has nothing to do with white guilt or political correctness. A lot of white people scared of blacks but won&rsquo;t admit it. I think it&rsquo;s combination of dark skin,,body language and facial expressions that intimidate white people.</p>

<p>If a white fights back, he or she is villified as a criminal and faces the worst consequences possible.  I hate, hate to say this, but it is better for a white to submit to a beating by the blacks than risk school expulsion and juvenile hall or jail for the crime of resisting black assault.</p>
<p>Whites are the helots, and black ferals are the Spartan youth empowered to keep the helots down.</p>

			<p>ALEX II, with all due respect, I think you&rsquo;re missing Irene&rsquo;s point.  She means the black and brown kids are being TAUGHT to hate whites.  All a person has to see is a few photos of evil whites lynching blacks to instill a sense of anti-white hatred, and these kids are seeing and learning this stuff on a daily basis   &mdash;   in school, on tv, in movies, books, etc.  The indoctrination is effective enough to make WHITE kids hate white people   &mdash;   to the point that they forget their own parents, siblings, grandparents, etc. are white, too, and probably not evil.</p>

			<p>This story isn&rsquo;t too surprising. I went to elementary schools that were majority white (80%-90%?), and the vast majority of the black kids were bullies and troublemakers. There were some nasty white children as well, but they were the exception, not the rule. Even as a child, I noticed this difference. I think every white child should be enrolled in self-defense courses. Even if they never have to use it, it&rsquo;ll build confidence and keep them active.</p>

			<p>To poster at 8:01: &#8220;&hellip; black and brown kids are taught to hate whites&#8221; I don&rsquo;t think that they bully because they were told about slavery and lynching. Do dogs attack humans because somebody told them that humans enslaved their ancestors and put stray dogs to sleep in pounds? How many white kids after reading The Color of Crime will start bullying black kids? How many blacks were attacked by rampaging whites after O.J. Simpson acquittal?                                                       To poster at 4:06: &#8221; If a white fights back he or she is villified as a criminal&hellip;&#8221; It depends on the circumstances. I highly doubt that anyone will be punished for resisting a beating.</p>

			<p>I was bullied early and often at home and at school, until I could take any level of abuse for a while.  I wanted to run away, but it turned into every waking hour.  My eventual rule, once none of that worked anymore, was that I always hit a known bully first, with three feet of chain, once I could get him alone.</p>
<p>There was one with whom I adopted an &#8220;attack on sight&#8221; policy, in which I would start pounding him on sight, no matter who else was there, as he threw rocks at one of my girlfriends.  It got to be reflex-action.  I once stood him up holding his hair and pounded his face until I couldn&rsquo;t stand him up anymore and my right hand was a bone-deep bloody ruin.  His face looked worse than my hand.  He would run away from me on sight after that.</p>
<p>He and his friends were a year behind me when I was in ninth grade, and I was still small, so they would gang up on me and beat me up.  I could take them one or two at a time.  By the time I was in 11th grade, I was very, very strong and really angry; they still had the same attitude, so I could take them four at a time, with or without a weapon, and I hurt them quite terribly on a routine basis whenever they didn&rsquo;t start running anytime I saw them.  I attacked on sight, whomever was watching.</p>
<p>Bullied white kids should turn their pain into patience.</p>
<p>There was a kid in shop class in 9th grade I complained to the teacher, Mrs. Hunter about.  He was picking on me.  She said she wouldn&rsquo;t help me, so I beat him with a hammer.  He ran away, screaming that I had hit him with a hammer, and Mrs. Hunter told him that she saw him picking on me, to quit whining, and that maybe next time he would pick on someone who didn&rsquo;t know what a hammer was for.  I figured I had the right to hit him harder the next time, and right in the forehead.  He turned out to be an OK guy, once he figured bullying was out.  I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t hit him too hard.</p>

			<p>I think that the gap between the importance of this article and the paucity of comments is very telling.</p>
<p>1. Of all of the articles on the board right now it is, by far, the most important.  And yet, it has very few comments.  But look at the amount of comments for something on Obama, or the James Watson affair.</p>
<p>The reason?  Well, there are probably a few.  But one is the shame attached to being a REAL victim.  I doubt if there is many of us who can&rsquo;t identify with those of you who have posted about having been bullied. I&rsquo;m grateful that some of you have shared about your experiences and impressed with your willingness to come out of hiding, as it were. But we have lots of practice bullying our own children.  I think Shelley&rsquo;s post was excellent.  But, just as few have responded to this article as opposed to other articles, no one has even acknowledged her plea, which is that we &#8220;get right with our families.&#8221; </p>
<p>Though I&rsquo;m better at facing this stuff now, I can remember being a part of a group therapy that had to do with survivors of Family abuse. My story is pretty bad, but there were stories I heard where people had to walk out of the room. One time, even the THERAPIST excused himself by having the group take a &#8220;coffee break.&#8221;  We all knew why.  It gets to be overwhelming.  But that feeling HAS to be overcome. It is absolutely stupid to mutter a cliche like &ldquo;get over it&#8221; or &#8220;move on.&#8221;  OF COURSE we have to get on with life.  But do you think getting over it and moving on are easy???  Geez, human beings have been around for thousands of years practicing violation on each other and only in our lifetimes have we begun to talk about it and how it might not be such a good idea.  It&rsquo;s process, not an event.</p>
<p>What I think is so sad, is that, Americans would eventually have come round to sorting themselves out - if not for two things.</p>
<p>1- Political Correctness.</p>
<p>2- Immigration.</p>
<p>And as we all know, they&rsquo;re connected. A great thinker once made the point that just as the Renaissance was picking up steam and about to spread through Europe, the worst elements of the Reformation (not all of it, but certain elements) came along and squashed it, snuffed it out.<br>
So too, just as Democracy was picking up steam and beginning to spread in the best sense, Political Correctness (the crudest, most anti-intellectual, anti-historical, over-simplified world view ever created by man) has come along to snuff it out.<br>
And what did both the Renaissance and Democracy have in common?  The Soveriegn Individual.  Individual Conscience over Blind Obedience to Authority.<br>
The worlds a mess alright. And unless we&rsquo;re going to roll over we ought to do something. I think the best place to start is with the Individual and where the Individual gets their start in life - the Family.<br>

			<p>&#8220;To poster at 8:01: &ldquo;&hellip; black and brown kids are taught to hate whites&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think that they bully because they were told about slavery and lynching. Do dogs attack humans because somebody told them that humans enslaved their ancestors and put stray dogs to sleep in pounds? How many white kids after reading The Color of Crime will start bullying black kids? How many blacks were attacked by rampaging whites after O.J. Simpson acquittal?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
ALEX II, if you can&rsquo;t discern a connection between the current anti-white crusade, its effect on a violence-prone people, and crimes against whites   &mdash;   including &#8220;bullying&#8221;, which has lasting effects on a person even if no physical assault has occurred   &mdash;   then I can&rsquo;t help you to get it.</p>

			<p>Just another good reason for &#8220;White Flight&#8221; and voluntary segregation. Children are always going to bully other children to some extent, but at least let them start on a level playing field. Have you ever noticed that most white liberals never put their own offspring into the hellholes they have visited upon the rest of us who must put our children in private schools to allow them to get an education without being beat down at every turn?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Two thirds of children from white families say they had been bullied in the last three years but less than half of children of Indian origin make the same assertion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously non-whites are bullied less because they are non-white, since the vast majority of bullies are blacks in gangs and mobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Whites are becoming more aggressive than they used to be as a result of trying to intergrate into a new society norm that is so aggressive. They have changed the way they behave in order to survive.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>To a small extent I would agree with that.  In fact that&rsquo;s why the Aryan Brotherhood was formed in prison.  A white gang had to be formed or whites would have continued to become fresh white meat to be beaten and harassed by non-white racists, which comprise about 95% in the black community and about 30% in the mestizo community.</p>
<p>Given a choice, most whites will avoid head to head confrontations, because such incidents are pointless and do not serve to advance their interests and whites are, for the most part, intelligent enough to understand that mindless violence is completely unproductive and stupid.  </p>
<p>Contrast that with literally thousands of years of the white warrior who has shown an eagerness to ferociously and courageously fight for a cause, a country, his family, or religion.   Those who know a bit about recent and past military history know full well the extent of white ferocity and courage, often in the face of insurmountable odds, whenever he is convinced that his cause is just and necessary.</p>
<p>But within the normal day to day activities of society violent confrontations are avoided for the vast majority of whites who are living a contented and happy life, concentrating on studies or getting ahead for the benefit of one&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>So I would say to the blacks and other non-whites who hate whites, keep it up until you push whites to the point where they finally believe the cause for fighting you is just, and see what the end result is going to be.  You won&rsquo;t like it at all.</p>
<p>So will you heed this warning?  Of course not.  How could we expect that when you&rsquo;ve never been able to comprehend anything else up to this point in time?  As usual, you&rsquo;ll need an example to finally understand.</p>

Once more we see most of the journalists of the media withholding the truth about race that could save White lives in future situations.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone here would deny that there are cases where Black students are the victim of bullying by Whites, especially if the Black student has characteristics that one would classify as geeky or nerdy.  However, the fact is that most of the time it most likely White students who are the victims of Black bullying.</p>

			<p>So it&rsquo;s &#8221;Coleman&#8221; now?  Alright, I&rsquo;ll play along this time.  If what you say is true, &#8221;Coleman&#8221;, then why must we continue this failed experiment called integration?  If whites make life so unbearable for blacks (with our bullying, racism, and discrimination), then why do blacks feel they must continuously follow whites whenever we flee?  If whites are so terrible, it would make perfect sense to get as far away from us as possible, as whites attempt to do when it comes to blacks.  The problem for blacks is that whites can get along just fine without them.  In fact, the quality of life for whites would be astronomically higher without blacks constantly invading our space.  A large percentage of blacks, on the other hand, are perpetually dependant on the very ones that they despise so much, and thus their very existence would be threatened without whites providing for them.</p>

			<p>Whites must reverse this trend and begin to fignt back at all costs. Never allow yourself to be bullied by any non-white as they know its only a mind game. Hit back. Psychology works both ways. America was at a 10-1 odd against England in 1776 and stood up to the much superior force and won. This was white vs white but blacks and non-whites are a weak race mentally and will fold when challenged.</p>

<p>Yes indeed there were/are white bullies too, I am also guilty of equal opportunity ambushing. While attending Elwood high in Northeast Kansas I was subjected to that and he was subsequently subjected to a terrible ambush beating. He was a senior footballer and I was the new kid in class 9th grade and I was thrown out of that school for the ambush. Anybody ever been the chronic NEW BOY in class and predictably have to fight the school bullies?</p>

<p>As Phillip stated, while there are indeed White bullies and thugs who target Black students,(and I do believe your story), the fact is that more than often nowadays, since the 1990s, given the politically correct society we live in, even these White bullies are going to be hesitant to attack Black students knowing the repercussions from civil rights groups, liberal minded administrators, and other factions who would in all probability, demand severe punishemnt for these White students who engage in such behavior.    </p>

			<p>What you experienced Skip was a result of what sociologists call binary oppositions which create divisions within humanity. These divisions are ultimately social constructs that reflect the fundamental sociological need for communities to self define and identify those who are &#8220;in&#8221; and those who are &#8220;out,&#8221; those who are &#8220;friends&#8221; and those who are &#8220;foes.&#8221; </p>
<p>The importance of &#8220;binary opposition&#8221; in shaping perceptions of identity has been highlighted in recent years, not least on account of the major debate between different schools of critical thought over whether such oppositions determine and shape human thought or are the outcome of human thought. </p>
<p>For example, the atheistic assertion that the elimination of religion would lead to the ending of violence, social tension or discrimination which is sociologically naive because it fails to take account of the way in which human beings create values and norms, and make sense of their identity and their surroundings. If religion were to cease to exist, other social demarcators would emerge as decisive, some of which would become transcendentalized in due course.<br>
 <br>
Here&rsquo;s the rub though: would you rather deal with the jock soc versus greaser binary oppositions of yesterday or the virulent strains overtaking our state today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take yesterday&rsquo;s any day of the week and twice on Sunday thank you very much.<br>

Paranoia?  Hardly.  Suspicion is a better word.  Suspicions bolstered by the numerous lies that seem to ooze so easily from blacks.  As an example, why is it that whenever a noose incident is mentioned, suspicion (theres that word again) is the immediate response.  Could it be that after all the hoaxes (lies), people tend to not believe as quickly as before?  How about all the cries of discrimination, or claims that the &#8221;N&#8221; word was used as justification for beating down some otherwise innocent white, such as the recent bus beatings.  After about the 100th time hearing such claims, suspicion starts to seep in whenever a black makes a claim that they were the victim of white hostility or verbal abuse.  &#8221;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&#8221; comes to mind.  If you were truly the victim of such bullying at the hands of white jocks, then thats unfortunate.  Just understand that the many lies put forth by other blacks have diminished the credibility of true victims of mistreatment.  So when your credibility is questioned in the future, you can start by thanking Melvin/Calvin/Pharell.  Then move on to thanking Tawana Brawley, Crystal Gail Mangum, and the many others that have destroyed black credibility.</p>

<p>No offense, but WHAT??? what sociologists and especially psychologists ALWAYS fail to take into consideration when looking for explanations for human conduct is the fact that some people are just plain mean. Money, society, abuse as a child, education! none of it has much to do with it in my experience. Only the fact that some people are just mean by nature, genes or race is of no matter, just plain mean. It just happens that, also in my experience, many more blacks are inclined to be not just mean, but vicious and cruel along with malicious and have criminal inclinations. The blacks also know there is little to fear, in general, of retaliation by whites (their chosen prey) I am inclined to use H.G.Wells&rsquo; terms of Eloi and Morlocks of late in comparison of blacks (Morlocks) and whites (Eloi)assuming we are mostly familiar with &#8220;the Time Machine&#8221;</p>

			<p>  In my limited 1960s Junior High and High School career, I would say that blacks were more likely to be bullies than whites. Of course, some blacks were good students, polite and well behaved. In addition, there were plenty of white bullies and many of them hung around with the black thugs. It was considered cool to hang with the blacks, most of whom were school athletes. </p>

<p>I was considered a nerd when I was in high school. I was small, shy and introverted. My social circle was 6 guys. Two were Black, one was Asian and three of us were White. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the jocks at our high school for the most part, were nice guys and did not mess with us. It could have been due to the fact that my father was the principal and he ran the school with an iron hand, but all in all most people were relatively civil to one another.</p>
<p>Like your high schools, the athletes of all races associated with one another.</p>

Posted by Coleman at 10:50 AM on June 30 </p>
<p>What does paranoia have to do with making a judgment based on experience, facts, and a multitude of stories written about black crime, all to the point of making anyone with half a brain aware that blacks are trouble-makers?  Can you furnish an example of what you believe are paranoid assertions?</p>
<p>Your assertion reminds me of one I received on here regarding a poster who was too gullible and imperceptive to identify a very obvious imposter who thought he was &#8220;psyching&#8221; us.  Because he wasn&rsquo;t able to identify the fabrication he believed it didn&rsquo;t exist and concluded that anybody who could was &#8220;paranoid.&#8221; I doubt that neither of you even knows what the word means. </p>
<p>Resorting to calling someone paranoid when valid, supportable assertions are made, comes across as nothing more or less than a strung together cliche without any thought behind it.<br>
