<h1><a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810262-1,00.html">The Negro Crime Rate: A Failure in Integration</a></h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Time Magazine, April 21, 1958</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THEY are afraid to say so in public, but many of the North&rsquo;s big-city mayors groan in private that their biggest and most worrisome problem is the crime rate among Negroes.</p>
<p>In 1,551 U.S. cities, according to the FBI tally for 1956, Negroes, making up 10% of the U.S. population, accounted for about 30% of all arrests, and 60% of the arrests for crimes involving violence or threat of bodily harm &mdash; murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. In one city after another, the figures &mdash; where they are not hidden or suppressed by politicians &mdash; reveal a shocking pattern. Items:</p>
<p>New York (14% Negro). Of the prisoners confined in houses of detention last year to await court disposition of their cases, 44% of the males and 65% of the females were Negroes.</p>
<p>Chicago (15% Negro). In 1956 twice as many Negroes as whites &mdash; 1,366 to 679 &mdash; were arrested on charges of murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape and robbery.</p>
<p>Detroit (25% Negro). Two out of three prisoners held in the Wayne County jail are Negroes. Last month 62% of. the defendants presented for trial in Recorder&rsquo;s Court were Negroes. Of last year&rsquo;s 25,216 arrests resulting in prosecution, excluding traffic cases, Negroes accounted for 12,919.</p>
<p>Los Angeles (13% Negro). In 1956 Negroes accounted for 28% of all arrests, and 48% of the arrests for homicide, rape, aggravated assault, robbery, burglary, larceny and auto theft.</p>
<p>San Francisco (7% Negro). The victims in 896 of last year&rsquo;s 1,564 recorded robbery cases reported that the assailants were Negroes.</p>
<p>Negro leaders sometimes argue passionately that arrest statistics wildly distort the comparative incidence of crime among Negroes and whites because cops are more likely to arrest Negroes for petty crimes or on mere suspicion. {snip}</p>
<p>But inequality of treatment by the police may actually tend to shrink rather than inflate the statistics of Negro crime. Says Newsman Wartman in the next breath: &#8220;When Negroes violate social morals &mdash; sex, drinking, gambling &mdash; white cops bypass this as &lsquo;typically Negro.&rsquo;&#8221; Many Negro leaders protest that the police are far from diligent enough in dealing with crimes committed against Negroes &mdash; and Negroes are the victims in the great majority of Negro crimes of violence. Since Negroes, even when they are victims or innocent bystanders, are often wary of calling the police, many offenses of disorder and assault go unreported when committed by Negroes in the depths of a ghetto.</p>
<p>Whether the statistics of Negro crime overstate or understate the reality, they are shrouded from public attention by what a Chicago judge last week called a &#8220;conspiracy of concealment.&#8221; In many cities, Negro leaders and organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People put pressure on politicians, city officials and newspapers to play down the subject. Fearing loss of Negro votes, few elected officials dare to resist the pressures.</p>
<p>Abetting the concealment campaign is the feeling shared by many whites that it is unfair, inflammatory and even un-American to talk about Negro crime. This feeling is reflected in the widespread newspaper practice of not mentioning a criminal&rsquo;s race unless he is at large and the fact would help in identifying him.</p>
<p>In hiding the facts about Negro crime, the &#8220;conspiracy of concealment&#8221; helps blur the causes of it. Negro leaders themselves often put forward explanations that are oversimple. {snip}</p>
<p>Most often, Negro leaders point to poverty as the No. 1 factor in Negro crime. {snip}</p>
<p>Providing better housing for impoverished Negroes is a necessity, but it would not solve the problem of Negro crime. Crime rates run high in the Negro slums of Harlem and South Side Chicago, but they also run high in the Negro districts of Los Angeles and San Francisco, where the houses are comparatively decent. As many a public-housing official has learned to his dismay, better housing does not automatically bring about the improvement in character and conduct that do-gooders used to predict. Slum dwellers who move into brand-new public-housing projects often turn them into new slums as verminous and crime-ridden as the tenements they left behind.</p>
<p>Negro leadership could make a start toward lowering Negro crime rates by abandoning the conspiracy of concealment and urging full disclosure of the facts to be met. Once they faced the facts, Negro leaders and organizations &mdash; including the N.A.A.C.P. &mdash; could help by wholeheartedly undertaking short-term efforts of rehabilitation, by accepting responsibility in an area where they habitually look the other way.</p>
<p>But even heroic efforts by Negro leadership could only dent the Negro crime problem, because essentially it is a white problem. And it will remain a severe problem until Northern whites, private citizens as well as civic officials, recognize that Negro crime is basically a symptom of a failure in integration, and start attacking discrimination in the North with the same fervor they show in arguing for civil rights in the South.</p>
<p>Unlike the Caucasian immigrant of an earlier day, a Negro can scarcely ever hope, even in the North, that the white society will really accept him on his human merits. Negroes are more prone than whites to break the laws, rules and customs of society because they are excluded from full membership in it. In gross and subtle ways, from unwritten bans on employing Negroes to the faintly patronizing tone that even liberal-hearted whites take toward them, Negroes are made to feel alien and inferior. This pervasive discrimination holds down capable Negroes at the top of the social ladder, dims their voices among their own people, builds up tensions and resentments inside the Negro society, and keeps great masses of Negroes segregated in ghettos where the standards of personal morality, discipline and responsibility are lower than those in the white world outside.</p>

Nothing, but absolutely nothing, has changed in fifty years.  Same old behavior, same old excuses.</p>

			<p>None of this is surprising, but it&rsquo;s nice to see.  I&rsquo;ve forwarded the link to numerous people.</p>
<p>This may very well be the Achille&rsquo;s heel of obama, white crime victims and their familes.  Add to them the whites who have seen their property values decline due to black infestation of their neighborhoods, the number of white refugees (white flight,) the number of whites who have been passed over for promotion, denied jobs, or denied places in college due to affirmitive discrimination.  When whites walk into that voting booth in November, they are going to have to ask themselves, do they really want a black man, his black wife, black kids, and all their black relatives shucking and jiving in the white house?  I&rsquo;m betting that most of them will vote against obama.  obama has to get approximately 60 percent of the white vote in order to win, and he didn&rsquo;t even get 60 percent of the white democratic vote in the primaries.  When you look at how much money he has, and the fact that he has thousands of print and broadcast &#8220;journalists&#8221; in the tank for him, he is barely ahead of McCain.  Given the fact that obama always over polls due to whites not wanting to admit that they aren&rsquo;t going to vote for him, his lead over McCain almost disappears altogether.  I believe the media is going to be in for a big shock when they realize that they couldn&rsquo;t pull this one out for their boy.</p>

			<p>I remember reading this very article fifty years ago. It&rsquo;s quite incredible that after fifty years of this nation suffering wildly out of proportion black crime rates the only acceptable explanation for implacable black crime is still white discrimination.</p>
<p>It would downright comical were it not so tragically wrong-headed.</p>

			<p>     It is amazing how political correctness was evident fifty years ago. Notice how the article ends by suggesting actions guaranteed to make things worse. Remember, this is the fifties, which I remember well. In those days I could ride my bicycle through what we would today call a &#8220;ghetto&#8221; or &#8220;disadvantaged area&#8221; and not have the slightest fear. After we, as a people, took to heart the remedies suggested in this article, crime spiked to even greater heights. Jared Taylor&rsquo;s &#8220;Paved with Good Intentions&#8221; tells the story, as does Charles Murray&rsquo;s &#8220;Losing Ground&#8221;. I have read and reread both and am going to do so again. </p>

			<p>This 50 year old article makes quite a point.  Black crime was out of control long before LBJ&rsquo;s Great Society which was blamed for breaking up the black family.  Also the conspirary to play down black crime by the news media goes way back. NAACP and the so-called black leaders including,. Jackson, Sharpton and now Obama are forever  blaming the very high black prison population on a biased justice system.  They have absolutely no evidence of this  but the fact that 13% of the general population makes up more than 50% of the prison population. They obviously believe that this, ipso facto, proves that the justice system is biased against blacks.  The real and obvious reason is that blacks commit more crimes. Race hustlers like Jackson and Sharpton are continually stirring the pot, never missing an opportunity to  allege racial discrimination and selling their  lies to the general black population.  And, they are not doing this to benefit the black population but for personal profit motive. <br>

			<p>The liberals might not have learned much over the past half-century, but the Black sure have&hellip; even if only how to commit more crimes, more often, and become a perpetual millstone on White taxpayer&rsquo;s necks.</p>

When I first saw &#8220;1958&#8221; I thought it was a misprint   &mdash;   before I realized what AmRen was up to by dusting off this golden oldie of liberal delusion. </p>
<p>But even when reading it, I still had to check the date   &mdash;   because other than the racial group in question having been rebranded TWICE since &#8216;58 (first to &#8220;black,&#8221; and then to &#8220;African-American&#8221;), the article seems remarkably current. Certain stats may be different   &mdash;   Detroit&rsquo;s black pop. has increased, while LA&rsquo;s has declined   &mdash;   but the general trends of crime and other undesirable behavior have been substantially stable over half a century. </p>
<p>Even more remarkably unchanged is the do-gooder attitude of the author   &mdash;   who assumes that this troubled group&rsquo;s &#8220;challenges&#8221; and &#8220;issues&#8221; would ALL MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR if only those stingy white folks would just look into their hearts, open up their wallets, and THROW MORE $$$ at the problem. </p>
<p>Oh noble liberal editors of TIME Magazine, we&rsquo;ve been trying what you suggested in 1958 for FIVE DECADES now, and we as a country don&rsquo;t seem to be any further ahead for it. In many ways, we seem to be behind. So here&rsquo;s my question to you: Exactly how much longer you want to keep pursuing the same failed strategies of wealth redistribution to achieve racial uplift? </p>
<p>For ANOTHER fifty years? </p>
<p>Another HUNDRED, maybe? </p>
<p>TWO hundred? </p>
<p>What if it takes FIVE hundred? </p>
<p>(And what if it can&rsquo;t be done at all?) </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s TIME for some fresh thinking on this subject. <br>

			<p>Greg makes some great points. I just hope he is right. Whites had better come to their senses and realize what Obama is all about, and that is simply much higher taxes, especiall if the Democrats get a 60 seat majority in the Senate as expected. I don&rsquo;t see why Obama is such hot stuff. He has the most liberal voting record in the Senate, has sponsored no innovative legislation, has associated with all sorts of shady characters in the past and is now changing positions according to the prevailing political winds. We can only hope voters come to their senses because of all the reasons Greg listed. But as far as I&rsquo;m concerned Republicans messed up big time by giving us McCain, who is more Democrat than Republican. McCain&rsquo;s age and obvious physical handicaps make even Obama look good by comparison. What I really fear is that so many will be turned off by both McCain and Obama they will vote third party, which could elect Obama.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What if it takes FIVE hundred years?&#8221;</p>
<p>In five hundred years - no - actually long before then at the rate we are going, there aren&rsquo;t going to be any more White people.  Everyone will either be Oriental or brown-skinned or some combination thereof, except of course for one small group, (but that&rsquo;s another story).  I think even then, if the same people who control the media now, control it then, they will make these brown-skinned people believe it was all the evil White man&rsquo;s fault.  That all that White racism 500 years back is what is keeping them down.  Let&rsquo;s face facts; Blacks will always blame White&rsquo;s for their problems, as long as they can get away with it.  And they&rsquo;ve been getting away with it for some time now.</p>

			<p>I remember when I was in grade school in Lawton, Okla. that at NIGHT!! a large group of us kids could play &#8220;kick the can&#8221; in the streets (anyone remember kick the can?) My parents never admonished us, any of us, about the dangers of being out at night or anywhere at anytime for that matter. I am a fairly formidable adult now and  in those places I carry a gun now, and even armed, I feel I may not be carrying enough ammo (but I do carry several clips)</p>

			<p>Liberals will learn nothing to the day that this nation literally collapses around them because of their policies. If they haven&rsquo;t learned anything from the massive failures and injustice of the great society programs, forced bussing, affirmative action, quotas, and literally dozens or hundreds of other liberal program fiascos  &mdash;   they never will. They are incapable of self examination and honesty.</p>

			<p>I found it interesting that the article made no mention of drug crimes. I guess it had yet to become a widespread problem, even among blacks. So even without crack cocaine etc, blacks managed to account for a huge proportion of of criminal activity. Hopeless, really.</p>

			<p>Did everyone see the media coverage of Ms. Eve Carson&rsquo;s murder?? it even has video of the BLACK assailant/robbers/murderers AND identifies them by name not just 2 youths. I am totally blown away by this revelation, not even photoshopped to conceal their race. Can&rsquo;t wait for more details of this and it was a JUDGE that allowed the information and photos to be used on the air!</p>

			<p>Wow.  A refreshing blast from the past  &mdash;  or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not old enough (44) to remember the &#8216;50&rsquo;s, but this article eerily resonates in more than one way with our contemporary discussion on black crime rates.  </p>
<p>I must say, though, that unlike the posters before me I found the tone and slant to be considerably less liberal than the utterly Orwellian propaganda of today  &mdash;  except for the last couple of paragraphs, which suddenly drive a Marxist wedge between its body and conclusion, blaming rampant black crime and depravity on alienation from white society instead of the failure of collective character.</p>
<p>The early and middle parts of the piece did point out and express some wry candor about the not-yet-named political correctness that cowed big city mayors from openly talking about the problem, and also provided pretty solid analysis of the factors aggravating the honest assessments of statistics, along with describing the dissonance and atavism of black leadership and their denizens.        </p>

			<p>One interesting thing I noted - there&rsquo;s no mention of crime rates at the time in New Orleans, Atlanta, Memphis or any other Southern city (you could probably even throw D.C. in there).  Food for thought&hellip;</p>

			<p>About a decade ago, I went to a museum in Memphis. One of the displays was on Boss crump&rsquo;s Memphis. It noted that the town then - a Jim Crow town - was widely praised by visitors, business investors, and locals as being clean, friendly, and safe and largely crime free. Memphis is now a crime-ridden Hellhole. The differences? More blacks and, more important, political control by blacks, who has stamped their African culture on everything.</p>
<p>Old fashioned naive white Liberals, being good Americasn who just knew that Southerners were somehow bad, assumed that once legal race discrimination ended, blacks would become just like whites in every way: the same crime rates and the same IQs and the same work ethic as whites. The article above from 1958 shows the jarring result when the facts turned out to be diametriclaly opposite the Liberal white Yankee faith.</p>
<p>It was at that point that America was set to go down the tubes, because at that point all the well-meaning, naive white Yankees saw two choices: agree that the Southern views were correct (Jim Crow forced blacks to behave much better than they would have otherwise) or decide to reject facts and truth in favor of theory of racial egalitarianism. The latter choice necessarily meant that white Southerners must be hated and publicly condemned more than they had since the height of Reconstruction. It meant that as during the end of the War to Prevent Southern Secession (become a war to free blacks) and Reconstruction, white Northerners would be allied with blacks to destroy the South and Southern culure, in the name of an egalitarian Americanism.</p>
<p>We live with the results of those two historical events and choices and they are awful. If we do not manage to stop the process, its end result will be something close to what is going on in South Africa, in terms of unrelenting black crime against all but the wealthiest of whites.</p>
<p>Our problem, as in 1860-1876 and since the 1960s, is that white Elites are in bed with blacks, attacking in concert to stamp out all white centers of cultural resistance to being made virtual serfs in an allegedly egalitarian democracy. </p>
<p>It if were not for white Liberals, and self-righteous know-it-all Yankees generally, we would not have these problems, even with the same number of blacks here. If you doubt me, look at the crime rates for Jim Crow Memphis, and New Orleans and Birmingham and Montgomery and Atlanta and Richmond and Houston. Then compare them to today&rsquo;s crime rates in those black run cities.</p>

			<p><i>Great article. This explodes the conservative myth that black crime is a result of the cultural changes of the 60&rsquo;s.</i></p>
<p>Posted by joe at 12:30 AM on June 28<i></i></p>
<p>Joe, Surely Conservatives do not propound the notion that black crime is a result of the 60&rsquo;s counter culture. What they say, or at least I do, is that the Counter Culture condoned the behaviour of Blacks, excused it and enabled Blacks to live, work and socialise in White neighbourhoods, in short, the Counter Culture encouraged integration and excused Black criminal behaviour generally. Previously Black people were restricted to living in Black neighbourhoods.  Was&rsquo;nt it desegregation that brought their already existing crime into our lives? We know that they were kept separate for a reason, we knew that it was crime and promiscuity, the big lie is that there never was a Black crime problem. What this article does is to demonstrate that there always was a Black crime problem.<br>
 There is a small proportion of the Black population who do excel, sadly they seem doomed to be a perpetual minority.<br>

			<p>Here in Madison, the black crime rate is staggering. It&rsquo;s bad, I mean real bad, all over the city and now moving into its suburbs!</p>
<p>Given how &#8220;progressive&#8221; Madison has been over the years, even going backs to the 1800&rsquo;s, it is interesting to watch the chickens coming home to roast for the Madison liberal elites. They have no plans to stop the flow, either.</p>

			<p>Probably p9litically VERY INCORRECT to say but Blacks have been a perpetual problem since the race diverged from humanity&rsquo;s common rootsock.</p>
<p>More than fifty thousands years of evolution and intellectual growth&hellip; and the end-product is the dysfunctional Black population we see in our cities. Lazy, given to drug and alcohol addition. Living on crime and welfare checks. Incapable of even getting along with their own kind. Drive through parts of Milwaukee, New York, Philly, baltimore, and of course Washington D.C. and look at them. Then think they&rsquo;re what those thousands of years of evolution and mental growth resulted in.</p>
<p>It is NOT White racism responsible for the poverty and despair. That feeling of uselessness Blacks claim to feel. BLACKS, that&rsquo;s right, BLACKS ARE RSPONSIBLE! Because they are mentally incapable of developing past the childlike and mental adolescent stage. Where you have the Black male fathering 8 or 10 kids by six or eight Black females. Then disappearing into the distance. Not bothering with parental responsibility much less supporting his offspring.</p>

<p>They are writing of Fillmore, a lovely area of gorgeous Victorina homes from about 1860 to 1940 when blacks moved in and destroyed it.   Cerca 1975, white gays moved in and by 1995 it was once more one of the loveliest and most desirable areas  of the city.  And the homes are restored to their civil war era glory.</p>

			<p>Well, there is one major difference that has taken place in America since 1958.  </p>
<p>To wit:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the widespread newspaper practice of not mentioning a criminal&rsquo;s race unless he is at large and the fact would help in identifying him.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Nowadays they don&rsquo;t mention race even if the (black) criminal is an armed homicidal monster who is running amok among innocent people AT THAT VERY MOMENT.  They&rsquo;ll tell you what color his shirt is, however.</p>
<p>Better that innocent people   &mdash;   of any race   &mdash;   be raped and/or murdered than to tell the truth, apparently.  Might upset Jesse, Al, and the NAACP.</p>

<p>Exactly. In the &#8220;old south&#8221;, segregation existed because of the behavior of a large portion of black behavior. Whites simply couldn&rsquo;t integrate with people who behaved like that and there was such a large population of blacks there. It was never about something so shallow as skin color. They also kept a hard line on blacks because if they didn&rsquo;t, crime would have been out of control and the entire south would have been unsafe.</p>

Then I guess as a peasant of a feudal lord I should claim I have the right to &#8220;misbehave&#8221; because my ancestors were feudal peasants, and I was forced to work in fields of wheat and potatoes to provide for the lords.  What about the indentured servants from England?  Give me a break&hellip;  I judge people as individuals, not on race, but sometimes blacks justify the apprention we have of them as a social and racial group.   Race is a fact, not fiction.. and deal with it.</p>

			<p>I posted this following the parallel lives article from a few day ago but I think that it would be just as appropriate here, with some revisions. </p>
<p>Just ask anyone who lived in a formerly all White neighborhood in any city what it was like BEFORE diversity (tranlsate that Blacks) struck and AFTER.<br>
Let&rsquo;s take the North Penn (sometimes known as Swampoodle) section of Philadelphia for example (the following limits are rough estimates)bounded by Allegheny Ave. on the north and by Lehigh Avenue on the south and by Broad street on the east and by 33rd. street on the west.<br>
Before:<br>
1. People really could leave doors unlocked at night.<br>
2. People really did sleep on their front porch gliders or chaise lounges on hot nights in the summer before air conditioning became commonplace.<br>
3. If as a kid you did something &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; several blocks away your parents were waiting in ambush for you when you got home.<br>
4. Everyone knew his neighbors and looked out for them.<br>
5. Serious disputes between neighbors resulted in mutual shunning rather than in assault and murder. My family didn&rsquo;t speak to the family two houses away but we kids still played together all the time.<br>
6. Everyone with whom I was acquainted could identify all their relatives and family lines were clearly drawn.<br>
7. Although many people owned firearms, the peace of evening was never disturbed by the sound of gunfire. Shotguns were sold at the local hardware store.<br>
8. WE had block parties in the summer where everyone contributed food and entertainment.<br>
9. Although we were far from perfect none of us was ever afraid to walk the streets at night.<br>
10. The only fire I remember was one that started in my neighbor&rsquo;s kitchen due to carelessness with cooking oil. Neighbors rushed to her aid and extinguished it within minutes with little resultant damage. </p>
<p>After <br>
1. Frequent fires.<br>
2. Assaults, armed robberies and B &amp; E.<br>
3. Rapes and attempted rapes.<br>
4. Gunshots.<br>
5. Doors being locked and bars being installed on basement windows.<br>
5. Sale signs springing up everywhere.<br>
6. Eventual loss of property value, the loss of the unique character and the eventual death of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>We still have reunions every few years and talk about how we miss the &ldquo;old neighborhood&rdquo; and how &ldquo;different&rdquo; it is where we now live.</p>

			<p>&#8220;a large group of us kids could play &ldquo;kick the can&rdquo; in the streets (anyone remember kick the can?) &#8220;</p>
<p>Very big on my block in Richmond, Va. in the late 1940s. </p>
<p>My parents were strict, but during the hours I was allowed outside, I was allowed to go anywhere (if far, I&rsquo;d tell them where), and no worry was ever expressed by my parents as to my safety.</p>
<p>When 11 or 12 years old, I&rsquo;d walk alone or with friends through beautiful park land down to the James River, take a river path halfway downtown, and walk back through residential neighborhoods. No danger, no fear.</p>
<p>Now I look about constantly for threats when walking anywhere in Berkeley, Ca.. I gather Richmond, Va. may be even worse now. Disgusting.</p>

Yes, spot on 4.35PM, and the #2&rsquo;s use the fools in category #1 to achieve and grasp at power. They are so twisted out of their skulls with hatred of American success that it&rsquo;s become apparent to me that when a Liberal says &#8220;I love America&#8221;, what they&rsquo;re referring to is only the physical features and the population, the trees,mountains,Indians,Blacks,even white folks(esp.#1s). What they can never say is that they have a pathological hatred of the Capitalist system that made America into th most powerful and desirable nation in the world. Being isolated from this power and success, forcibly detatching themselves from the American way of life that surrounds them must cause them unimaginable stress, and all the while the Socialist lifestyle and economic system they propose causes millions  to starve to death and punishes or executes dissenters. Hence the burning need to bring this country to its knees by any means. How it must grate, they must so want to scream from the rooftops this truth about themselves;their loathing and vitriol towards the US system, but they have to suppress it and mouth platitudes about loving the country.<br>
 No wonder they&rsquo;re all so barking mad.<br>

			<p>The problem as I see it was that White southerners were never able to properly translate to northerners, the REASONS for Jim Crow. To northern Whites, unfamiliar with black behaviour, it came across as just mean-spirited. Add in regionalism and perhaps, some lingering antipathy from the WBTS, feelings which lingered in some areas until the 1950&rsquo;s and you can see the makings of this communication breakdown. </p>

<p>Correct, however It is the LACK of White racism that is responsible for the poverty and despair. Racism means recognizing certain differences and acting accordingly. </p>
<p>To make a crude analogy, let&rsquo;s examine the parents of a mentally retarded child . Imagine that child&rsquo;s life if they try to treat him exactly like a normal child. They leave him alone in the house when he reaches 13. He is behind the wheel at 16. Setting up his apartment at 21. His parents are upset because he has ruined their house, wrecked the car and the landlord has called about not receiving payment for the apartment. The son is angry, hungry and confused. </p>
<p>Again it is an inept comparison, but the point is that decisions should be based on what the facts are NOT what we wish them to be. Otherwise no one comes out satisfied and everyone is made miserable.</p>

			<p>Like many who have commented above, I am not surprised by the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; tone of this article or its conclusions. Far from it, since this was written in 1958 and the &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; movement was still in its heyday of popular, but also untested, monopolized &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; From this vantage point we might: shake our heads, laugh, and say &lsquo;well thank God things are different now,&rsquo; if it were not for the fact that not only did this article draw all the wrong conclusions about black crime and its solutions, but the &ldquo;remedies&rdquo; have also been tried and have overwhelmingly failed.  Thus, we have truly learned nothing in this country when it comes to dealing with blacks and their propensity for crime; thus, hard lessons that have no easy answers, are simply stuck into a repetitive feedback loop of excuse making and blame placing, respectively for &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo; blacks and &ldquo;ignorantly wicked&rdquo; whites.</p>
<p>Moreover, what is most disturbing about this article is that it likely is too candid and factual to be published in 2008. It notes for example, that the city of Detroit had a black population of only 25%, but 2/3rds of the Wayne County Jail population was black in 1956. An honest reporting of the FBI facts for the time, even if colored (for lack of a better term) by all the windy Marxist mumbo-jumbo of the day. Again, as I note above, for reporters and officials in 1958 such is forgivable because it was still &ldquo;uncharted&rdquo; territory in building the Utopian States of America.</p>
<p>Or put another way, 1967 had yet to pass and Detroit was not the barren wasteland of a 95% majority &ldquo;black rule&rdquo; and ubiquitous crime that it is today!</p>
<p>The question to ask, no matter how chilling and mortifying the answer, is how would this article or something like it, be handled today?</p>
<p>The answer is that it wouldn&rsquo;t, not in the way it is above.</p>
<p>This is because the social engineers and other Reds, were still in their own infancy when it came to playing &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; politics. There is to be sure, the whiff of the stink to come, but not the full noxious intoxicant of today&rsquo;s multiculturalism. In the above article, there remains a hint of reality mixed with the &ldquo;hope&rdquo; that all is not lost; there remains a quaint naiveté that while endemic to the black &ldquo;community&rsquo;s&rdquo; alien nature, integration might yet hold the &ldquo;cure&rdquo; to its crime problems.</p>
<p>However, and more chilling and mortifying still is to ask, how might the new problem of an &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; black crime/white victim paradigm be handled, on a landscape of attempted and failed social polices that can be distilled into two words, affirmative action?  How might an abject failure be handled; would it be to find a different perspective, or simply to heap more potential failure, on that which already exists?</p>
<p>Most here, already know the answer to those questions. But for those who do not, for those who still cling to the &ldquo;integrationist&rdquo; 1958 mindset, I ask you to read this article at the AR link below:</p>
<p><a href="/news/2008/06/hunting_season.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2008/06/hunting_season.php</a></p>
<p>Aptly titled &ldquo;Hunting Season for Whites,&rdquo; it gives a very clear picture of the &ldquo;integrationist&rdquo; model gone wrong in all its glory from 1958 to 2008. </p>
<p>Or put another way, by the eloquent Sheriff of Macomb County, Mark Hackel in regards to the rights of white victims of &ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo; black mob crimes: &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s questionable. I don&rsquo;t know if it applies to an unprotected class, and I don&rsquo;t know if whites are part of that. I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, and as always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>to the person who points out the reason for segregation in the &#8220;old South&#8221;:   as a Northerner from New England, I would agree with you, and point out that until the 1960&rsquo;s, the situation was not much different in the Northeast region. It&rsquo;s just the hypocrisy of the Yankees, Unitarians and the churches in the North in general masked the widespread belief of all white Americans that blacks in general are less intelligent and less able to keep emotions like lust and childlike impulses to take what&rsquo;s not theirs in check.  There are decent, intelligent blacks. They should be dealt with and respected on an individual basis. Most are incapable of integration however in the civilization of the West.  That is what was at issue in the 1958 Time article. It remains a relevant question today. Greater efforts to integrate will fail as they have failed already. Most blacks don&rsquo;t want to integrate, and either don&rsquo;t understand or don&rsquo;t want to understand the values of white, Western civilization. Indeed, they couldn&rsquo;t define civilization.  </p>

The very thought of that person inhabiting the whitehouse causes me grave concern for our country &amp; its future. How white Americans could have sunk to this new low is beyond be. Let&rsquo;s see, Obama is a half &amp; half. He prefers blacks to whites so obviously he doesn&rsquo;t like whites. He has been mentored by a radical black preacher while claiming this had no impact on how he views whites. He certainly doesn&rsquo;t admit that is is his part white mind that has gotten him where he is today by playing on the blacks psyche. Yep, weak minded whites are selling us out for the &#8220;yes we can&#8221; tripe and nobody, not even Obama can explain what that means.</p>

  -Social engineers know this. They also know that the true path to &#8220;equality&#8221; is not to raise Blacks up,but rather to lower the entire population down to the level you just described, wich is in fact the eventual result of integration&hellip;and they know it.</p>

			<p>Articles like this, once discovered by the MSM, don&rsquo;t usually last very long online.  I&rsquo;ve saved a copy of the original for myself for future reference.  As a matter of fact, many (if not most) MSM articles about black crime tend to disappear after a while so I&rsquo;m asking who, among you, has been archiving those originals on their personal computers?  If you go back through Amren&rsquo;s archives, you&rsquo;ll find many articles whose links no longer work because the original publishers have pulled them.  It&rsquo;s important to have those original sources because, if you cite Amren&rsquo;s abridged version, the first thing joe liberal is going to see is &#8220;Amren&#8221; and think &#8220;racist source&#8221;.  So, if we haven&rsquo;t been saving those originals, we&rsquo;d sure better get started doing that.</p>

			<p>Imagine through some incredible feat if all blacks in America (or Britain, France, Canada, etc, for that matter) were magically transported back to Africa. Would the USA be a safer or more dangerous country? Would the USA be richer or poorer? Would welfare rates go up or down? Would there be more crime or less? Would the USA be better or worse off?</p>

			<p>Any person denying that crime is associated with the influx of Blacks is a liberal lunatic living in an otherwise fairy tale. </p>
<p>Are you telling me that if Detroit had an all-white population tomorrow, it wouldn&rsquo;t be again the propserous city it once was prior to the 1970s? Or that if we replace the current white population of Beverlly Hills for a black population, the city wouldn&rsquo;t turn into a slum?</p>
<p>Until Blacks take the initiative of stop blaming whitey for all of the problems and start to take responsabilities for their own failures, then how can they ever hope of ever seeing a black neighborhood being successful and affluent.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Not too long ago europeans (especially the English) said it was a racist America that was to blame. One only has to observe who is committing the crimes all over Europe. Blacks and Muslims. This in the utopian EU! I guess the Europeans are racists?&#8221;</p>
<p>People who aren&rsquo;t around blacks etc.have no experience and thus don&rsquo;t understand, such was europe. Now the europeans are waking up the hard way.<br>

<p>Fritz, you could try some of David Livingstone&rsquo;s memoirs, what he found when he first ventured inland caused him great distress: slavery,(millions marched north by Islamic slavers), widespread untreated disease and general malaise. His suggested solution was Christianity, Colonialism and Cotton growing, leading to eventual self-reliance and less reliance on selling each other into slavery. <br>

			<p>&#8220;The scariest part of this article? The fact that back then blacks were only 10% of the U.S. population. It keeps creeping up and now it&rsquo;s around 13% - soon to be 14% no doubt.&#8221; Jewamongyou</p>
<p>   A relation of mine has a theory that the number of blacks is actually much greater than reported by the government. How many impoverished blacks honestly answer the Census surveys? Do they respect the law? Combined with illegal immigration from the Caribbean, Africa, Latin America, I suggest that the current number of blacks is more in the neighborhood of 16%. </p>

<p>That percentage should be a least 75%. The reason it isn&rsquo;t 75% is because liberal judges and prosecutors are playing racial politics. In other words, they&rsquo;re going easy on black criminals.</p>
<p>Too, there is what&rsquo;s termed by criminologists: &#8220;The Dark Figure of Crime&#8221;. That is: the crime that goes unreported to the police. Unreported crime in predominate black neighborhoods/cities is the norm. Top that off with the &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Snitch&#8221; culture.</p>
<p>Bottom line: As bad as the official crime statistics for blacks appear, the reality of the situation is MUCH worse. </p>

			<p>Whites just aren&rsquo;t all that criminally minded.  I am a defense lawyer in a western state, and I run into very few white, real hard cases.  Most are down on their luck, depressed, and commit crimes of opportunity.  Most are &#8216;sort of&rsquo; okay guys about 80 percent of the time.  <br>
Blacks and mestizos, on the other hand, approach life from the viewpoint that they are owed something, and they lie and commit crimes whenever possible, both to get ahead and to stick it to a society that they hate.  </p>

<p>My response to &#8220;Seeing Clearly&#8221; is that you are NOT INCLUDING those who served their time, those out on bail, parole, or even those who have NOT YET BEEN APPREHENDED AND CHARGED WITH A CRIME!</p>
<p>If you factor those &#8216;former&rsquo; felons or those charged but not jailed into the the figures, they would be shockingly higher. The inarguable reality being that BLACKS GRAVITATE TO CRIME AND CRIMINAL BAVIOR. A reality discernible not only among America&rsquo;s Black population but in the Black populations of White European nations, and certainly seen in those Black African nations turning up nearly daily in the news.</p>
<p>I am not certain what you intended to prove with your &#8220;more shocking 5-6%&#8221; but I would guestimate the percentage of criminals, ex-criminals (who served their time but not necessarily &#8216;reformed&rsquo;), plus those yet to be charged   &mdash;   would shift the percentage of Black criminals to probably 50% of the Black population. Kindly note Black females and certainly Black juveniles contribute a hefty proportion to the overall Black crime rate   &mdash;   something AmRen readers are very much aware of.</p>

<p>At least we can always count on there being fresh articles about black crime.</p>
<p>But I agree  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s a very worrisome problem. When one posts somewhere, one wants to give a good link to support one&rsquo;s argument. And even having saved the article to one&rsquo;s own computer (while a very good idea) doesn&rsquo;t solve that problem immediately.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It was at that point that America was set to go down the tubes, because at that point all the well-meaning, naive white Yankees saw two choices: agree that the Southern views were correct (Jim Crow forced blacks to behave much better than they would have otherwise) or decide to reject facts and truth in favor of theory of racial egalitarianism. The latter choice necessarily meant that white Southerners must be hated and publicly condemned more than they had since the height of Reconstruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by ole Jake</p>
<p><br>
A while back someone posted on this site a comment similar to ole Jake&rsquo;s. It was that the Jim Crow era in the South wasn&rsquo;t so much a matter of &#8220;white supremacy,&#8221; but rather was &#8220;a political restraining order on black criminality.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a Southerner, nor am I old enough to have met the estimable Mr. Crow personally. But I agree that Southern whites&rsquo; attitudes towards blacks were NOT rooted in racial egotism or personal meanness. It was simply a matter of applying a necessary amount of social pressure on certain people who (to put it as charitably as I can) find it hard to behave. </p>
<p>Northerners or other Americans who live in places with low black populations of under 10% tend to forget that some of these smaller towns in the South can be over 50% black. And that changes many things. One of the things it changes is white attitudes towards blacks: these whites get to see blacks up-close and personal. And they usually don&rsquo;t like what they see. (Nor should they: it usually ain&rsquo;t a pretty picture.) </p>
<p>For an even more extreme example, consider that during the Apartheid era in South Africa, the black/white split was something like 80/20. (These days, SA whites are even MORE outnumbered, closer to 90/10.) Whether in the American South or the African South, Apartheid-type systems are only put in place FOR A GOOD REASON. </p>
<p>That reason being that, absent any race-based restraints, the white population would be robbed, raped, and killed left and right. They don&rsquo;t want to black people; they just have an understandable fear of being KILLED by them. <br>

<p> Very good post. A good number of years back (1978,79?) I knew an English family that was living abroad for some months. We often talked about race. I pointed out how they didn&rsquo;t understand and that Britain was going to face the same problems down the road. They would dismiss me and say that Britain was going to be fine and the changes would be &#8216;wonderful&rsquo;. The unsaid implication was that British were &#8216;different&rsquo; (read not &#8216;racist&rsquo; like me and others). The way they talked about non-Whites being in Britain you would have thought they&rsquo;d just won 10 million pounds in a lottery. Subsequently they returned to London. I would love to run into that family again today and see what they think now. People never learn until its too late. </p>

			<p>Fritz, the facts are that the life expectancies of the sub-Saharan blacks before the Europeans arrived was on average about 30 to 35 years. Taking Rhodesia/ Zimbabwe as an example, when the whites led initially by a Dr. Jamieson and his group arrived and set up Rhodesia (after Cecil Rhodes) in the 1880s, the official estimate of black tribes living in that newly named country was 400 000.  Many of these were Ndebele people of the Matabele tribe who had fled there to escape the Zulu king called Chaka in the early 1800s.   </p>
<p>Afetr 70 years under European administration, the population grew to about 11 million (with an average life expectancy of about about 60 to 70 years) but it must also be remembered that many had moved there from other local countries because under the whites there was stability and plenty of food and good administration especially schooling and medical facilities.   This all was wrecked in the 28 years of rule under Mugabe and the average life expectancy for the masses has returned to 30 to 40 years with starvation and murder a big problem.</p>
<p>After all it is Africa, a continent where those outside have, through their meddling where they thought they were freeing the blacks, actually done just the reverse.  Perhaps that was one of the objectives?   hardly honest though was it?</p>

			<p>New York (26% Black, as of 2000 census, committed 68.5 percent of all murders, rapes, robberies, and assaults):</p>
<p>Strange. For several years, I watched re-runs of the earlier episodes of the TV series &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo; which took place in New York City, and I don&rsquo;t recall them ever doing a story on a black criminal. The defendants were all white, to the best of my recollection. They did do a story once about the black woman detective lieutenant who shot a black youth who tried to hold her up at an ATM. In that case, police brutality was the theme. For about a month, they also had a running theme of anti-Catholicism.<br>

			<p>I was born in 1956 and grew up in a liberal white family.  I was taught growing up not to discriminate against blacks and other minorities.  The civil rights movement, women&rsquo;s liberation movement, and peace movements were all favorably discussed at the family dinner table.</p>
<p>Like any teenager in the early 1970&rsquo;s, there were many times I rebelled against my parents.  There was one thing that did not make sense to me at that time, that does now in 2008.  In the early 1970&rsquo;s, as a white teenager with no real knowledge of black anti-white racism, there were times I foolishly wanted to go see &#8220;Hate whitey&#8221; black expliotation films like &#8220;Shaft&#8221;, &#8220;Superfly&#8221;, and &#8220;The Bus is Coming.&#8221;  My parents, despite being liberals, had the good sense to prevent me from going to a theater showing such awful films.  Now at 52, I see how dangerous it would have been for me, as a white person, to have gone there.</p>
<p>In fact, it was much safer in 1972 at the age of 16, in center city Philadelphia, PA, when I successfully lied about my age to get in to see such X-rated classic films like &#8220;Clockwork Orange&#8221;<br>
and &#8220;Fritz the Cat&#8221;!</p>
<p>So I ask myself this question; during the early 1970&rsquo;s were there idealistic young white hippies, who foolishly went to see such black expliotation films, only to get harrassed, robbed, and beaten up by the blacks in the movie theater?</p>
<p>Another question also crosses my mind; are there white liberals today who who are foolish enough to move into black areas, go to black events, and then face anti-white racism from blacks head-on?</p>

<p>You make some excellent points.  My contention was that saying that 50% of the crimes are committed by just 12-13% of the population is incorrect if the vast majority of that crime is committed by black males 18-35.  I was attempting to highlight that the amount of crime committed by black males is much higher because they only constitute perhaps 5-6% of the general population.  I&rsquo;m not using hard numbers here as I haven&rsquo;t researched it in depth, just rough estimates.</p>

<p>I saw that episode last night as well. Most of these police shows never feature a Black Criminal. The upper echelon Police officials are ususally Black, Judges are Black more than half the time (last night being an exception). The best example is SVU which deals mostly with rape in NYC and the rapisst are always white. If a Black is picked up as a suspect he is usually found out to be innocent and a White arrested at the end.<br>

			<p>  I live in the blackbelt and used to work routes there . Most of my routes were in black neighborhoods . I had a few scares . One Friday I had to go in a black juke joint,it was packed and they were getting down . I had to walk all the way thru the crowd to the very back of the buiding to get a reading, I was called just about every denigrating, anti-white term in the book.On occasion I had to collect on a past due account there .Eventually I got used to them and they got used to me . I had one fellow come at me with a Rapala filet-ing knife, I should have been afraid but I wasn&rsquo;t, he had to pay up . Once I had a high bill complaint, I walked in the front door and the customer was in the closet bent over trying to work the lever on a 30-30, his pal slammed the front door behind me and locked about a half dozen locks on the door .I tried to remain calm while looking for the back door under the guise of looking for electrical load in his house . It was a commemorative Winchester, he simply wanted to show it to me .Even so I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t have to work that job anymore .I have been called every name there is  for being white .Being Southern is a strange situation among blacks and whites, we love to hate each other and yet we love each other . There&rsquo;s no explaining it . But after some forty years of South-hating propaganda from the media and Hollywood, sooner or later there is going to be an explosion of violence along the lines of Detroit or East St Louis Illinois .Things just aren&rsquo;t like they used to be between the races .       </p>

<p>Before the War of Northern Aggression, the lives of Blacks and Whites were closely bound.  Even the Confederate troops were integrated, not just by slaves but by free Blacks.  The Union troops were segregated.  What changed the relationship between Blacks and Whites in the South was Reconstruction.  The Union used the Blacks to humiliate and punish Southerners - divide and conquer, so to speak. Liberals still do this.  </p>
<p>So,yes, we are torn, as I am when I read these posts.  I agree with them, but my heart breaks for all the decent Blacks I know.<br>
Like some of the Black ladies I work with - the ones who are dependable and hardworking, quiet and kind, never cause trouble, not even in gossip. And the loyal Black customers where I work who are friendly and easy-going.  These people do not belong in Africa.  </p>
<p>And yet, every evening I hear on the news about more Black crime going on in Memphis. </p>

It&rsquo;s going to get worse before it gets better.Once during the holidays as I pulled my truck up to the next house a gang of young males had to pause as I came by the street they were on that dead-ended into the street I was on. &#8221; Hey man, you sposed to wait on us.&#8221; I calmly looked them in the eye as I walked to the house and replied,&#8221; You see me waiting don&rsquo;t you ?&#8221; Had that occurred in a northern city or even a border state, I would probably be hospitalized or dead now . But like I said, that is slowly changing for the worse .Thanks to fifty years of media and Hollywood,South-hating propaganda . </p>
