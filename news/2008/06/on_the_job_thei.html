						<p>Fatuma Hassan has just enough rice in her near-empty cupboards to make it through the month. The anger she felt when she lost her job in May has given way to a dull, nagging hunger.</p>
<p>Yet this soft-spoken 22-year-old became an unlikely hero within the Somali community when she and five of her Muslim co-workers were dismissed last month from the Mission Foods tortilla factory in New Brighton for refusing to wear a new company uniform &mdash; a shirt and pants &mdash; they consider a violation of their Islamic beliefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, wearing pants is the same as being naked,&#8221; Hassan said, noting the prophet Mohammed taught that men and women should not dress alike. &#8220;My culture, my religious beliefs, are more important than a uniform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past century, Minnesota has seen waves of immigrants from Germany, Sweden, Norway and Laos, among other nations, and each group managed to move up the ladder of prosperity despite some initial doubts about their ability to integrate.</p>
<p>Yet nearly two decades after a violent civil war brought thousands of Somali refugees to the Twin Cities, their integration in the U.S. workplace is becoming more contentious.</p>
<p>Their insistence on maintaining Muslim traditions, including prayer times and modest clothing, have led to firings at several manufacturers across the state and a sharp increase in religious discrimination complaints.</p>
<p>The well-publicized clashes also have sparked legal and ethical debates on whether efficiency-hungry workplaces are doing enough or defiant workers are accommodating too little.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Twenty-three percent of Somali workers in Minnesota work in manufacturing jobs, well above the 16 percent for the population as a whole, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. And one-quarter of Somalis in the state over the age of 25 have less than a ninth-grade education, a rate five times higher than the overall population, according to census data.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bias complaints rising</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Religious discrimination complaints nationally have nearly doubled since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks &mdash; a reflection, some argue, of the heightened state of anxiety and fear concerning Muslims. In Minnesota, Muslims filed 45 religious discrimination cases with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2007, up from just eight in 2004. The EEOC does not break down this data by ethnicity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For Abdisalam Adam, director of the Dar Al-Hijrah Cultural Center in Minneapolis and an imam at an area mosque, the issue goes beyond 9/11 to cultural differences. &#8220;You would think this would have been more of an issue in 1993 or 1994,&#8221; when Somalis started arriving in the Twin Cities in large numbers, he said. &#8220;But now, Somalis and employers have gotten to know each other, and the situation is only getting worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Somalis come from tribes that move with their herds every six months in a constant search for safe grazing land, Sheikhosman said. Many of these nomads are fiercely independent and equate freedom with being left alone, he said.</p>
<p>Sheikhosman said that each time he returns to Somalia to visit his relatives, he is struck by &#8220;the general chaos of the place,&#8221; he said. At a Somali airport counter, he said, the only way to be served is to yell and push one&rsquo;s way through a crowd.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Combined with this nomadic sense of independence is a belief that faith and life are interconnected, and that religious practices should not be confined to a particular hour or day of the week, said Adam of the Dar Al-Hijrah Cultural Center.</p>
<p>Many of the religious discrimination complaints revolve around the Islamic prayer schedule. Praying five times a day is one of the essential pillars of Islam, but prayer times vary daily, based on the times of sunrise and sunset. In July, the difference between the afternoon and sunset prayers can be four hours apart; in December, it&rsquo;s just two hours.</p>
<p>The changing prayer times can be disruptive to assembly-line manufacturers that maintain assigned break schedules and can&rsquo;t afford to have their workers leave their work stations at unscheduled times. Many Somalis argue that their prayers take no longer than a bathroom break, yet bathroom breaks aren&rsquo;t prohibited.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Mission Foods clash has also led to a lawsuit. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights group, filed a religious discrimination complaint on behalf of the women with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p>Mission Foods had implemented the new dress code for all factory workers and told its Muslim workers that their traditional clothing was too loose-fitting and posed a safety hazard near machines.</p>
<p>Strength in numbers</p>
<p>Muslim religious leaders, or imams, play a significant leadership role in the Somali immigrant community and are often sought out for advice on how to behave in the workplace. Imams were vocal supporters of the Somali taxi drivers who, last year, attracted nationwide controversy for refusing to transport alcohol-toting customers from the airport.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Somalis&rsquo; growing numbers have helped embolden them, Corrie added. In 2006, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that Minnesota was home to 24,430 people of Somali descent. But immigrant groups say the Somali population may be two or three times that number, because many Somalis are illiterate and don&rsquo;t respond to census surveys.</p>
<p>&#8220;With numbers comes strength,&#8221; Corrie said. &#8220;There is now a critical mass of Somalis for them to mobilize and for their voice to be heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On a few occasions, Somali male workers complained about having to take orders from female managers. And once, as violence in Somalia intensified, a fight broke out on a job site between members of separate warring clans. The company held a training session on how to get along in the workplace, and the fighting stopped.</p>

  The failure to do this is what has allowed PC -which is designed by their own account to destroy the white race and the Christianity which it supports- to make a wreck of the US, bring in &#8220;immigrants who claim racial and ethnic preferences and refuse to accomodate the native born inhabitants.<br>
  Send the Somilis back to Somilia where they belong and dump all the complaints and diversity. The Somoli taxi drivers refuse to take US citizens with a bag which might contain alcohol or to take handicapped citizens and they should be jailed and deported<br>
for anti-American discrimination. Claiming that their religion demands this is a lie. Turks, Lebanese and other Moslems do drink alcohol.</p>

			<p>I have actually had the unfortunate experience of working closely with Somalis.  It was an extra summer job that involved picking merchandise for orders and accurately packing them for shipment.<br>
They were always screwing up the orders and didn&rsquo;t seem to care.  They constantly made a pigsty out of the women&rsquo;s bathroom, washing their feet in the sink and leaving puddles of water everywhere.  They refused to clean anything, whether it be at the end of shift or their own messes. They were unendingly rude and contemptuous of others. They ignored all the rules that the rest had to follow, and to top it off, they emitted a horribly foul odor!!<br>
One day we all got together to complain, and were told by the supervisor to overlook it because they didn&rsquo;t want any lawsuits out of these people.  Didn&rsquo;t do much for morale, either.<br>
Sorry, I had to vent.  I never want to repeat that experience again ever.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s too late for Minnesota. But Maine has only recently let Somalis in. I am sending this article to Maine Gov. John Baldacci, at Maine.gov and you should too. Baldacci is of course a multi-cultural stooge, but if enough Maine voters express their outrage at this subversive immigration, he may see the light, even if it&rsquo;s just to save his career. </p>

			<p>I am from Ohio, and there are a large number of Somalis in Columbus and most other large Ohio cities.  They are arrogant, and all around detestable.  They complain about everything.  They put on a good appearance, but when you get close to them, they smell.  You never see just one or two, they travel in large groups, and a group of these people is truly repugnant.  I get the distinct impression they look down on Americans.  My husband works with several at the prison where he is employed, where they have to be told about their hygiene.  One was complaining the other evening, that he had purchased a home, and now had to pay taxes.  Not only do Somalis get free rides to our great country, but them and other immigrants don&rsquo;t pay payroll taxes for 10 years after arriving here. </p>

			<p>Why in the world would we invite Somalis of any religion into this country?  One look at Mogadishu, one would think, would dissuade any sane government from inviting these people, who bring no skills, no apparent creative talent, and little in the way of civil behavior, into its nation.</p>

<p>Bunch of liars. If this statement had any truth to it then there would be no problem. Take a bathroom break and use it to pray&hellip; or is that too easy?<br>

			<p>Just for interests sake to American and British readers of this site. There are 500,000 somalis living in Great Britain (mainly in London, Bristol, Cardiff and Leicester), their numbers rapidly grow due to their incredibly high birth rate and constant immigration. Over 80% of adult somalis are unemployed in Britain and their teenagers are increasingly committing street crime and embracing radical Islam. <br>
Sobering facts aren&rsquo;t they, my fellow Brits! </p>

			<p>Have the Muslims ever heard the old adage, &#8220;when in Rome, do as the Romans?&#8221; Besides, if the women wore pants, they WOULD be<br>
dressed differently than the men - don&rsquo;t the Muslim men wear long robes that look like dresses? Better still, if they would all go home, they wouldn&rsquo;t have to complain. Mexico uses the &#8220;poor&#8221; hammer on us. Are Muslims poor? I though every one in the Middle East was oil-rich. What&rsquo;s their excuse in coming? Another millstone around our necks. Where is America? </p>

			<p>&#8220;Somalis and employers have gotten  to know each other and the situation is only getting worse&#8221;<br>
 I have no more sympathy for these employers. At first I thought that they were a victim of religious and ethnic warfare like the rest of us, but now I see them only as co-conspiritors. They hired them and therefore are the main reason these outsiders are staying and enforcing their ways on the rest of us. Tell me how it works out for ya boss man.<br>
 &#8221; A fight broke out on the job site between members of warring clans.&#8221; Someone needs to take a page from my buddy`s HighSchool playbook. His forte was school spirit vandalism. He used to raid the other schools on the night before games and daub their auditorium in our school colors. One night, in a stroke of inspiration he daubed a THIRD schools colors on the opposing teams fieldhouse instead of our own blue and white. Then he sat back and watched a fight break out at the drive-in between the two groups. He laughed so hard at the mayhem he caused that he almost choked on a tater-tot. Luckily, a  well earned congratulatory slap on the back from a fellow student cleared his airway. </p>

<p>Ha Ha!  I wonder why the situation got worse after American citizens actually got to know the Somalis?  Could it be that reality is very different from the multi-cultural paradise touted by those who seek to destroy America?</p>

			<p>The article claims: &ldquo;With numbers comes strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, that is certainly correct, and is the primary reason for the frantic efforts by some people to import massive numbers of Third Worlders into Europe and North America.  As these primitive people become dominant, the &#8220;strength&#8221; of whites will decline, and eventually disappear altogether. </p>

&ldquo;With numbers comes strength,&rdquo; Corrie said. &ldquo;There is now a critical mass of Somalis for them to mobilize and for their voice to be heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
And what will that voice say? Considering that &#8220;one-quarter of Somalis in the state over the age of 25 have less than a ninth-grade education,&#8221; and their extreme devotion to Islam, what that voice will say is almost certain to be uninformed, unenlightened, and stridently anti-Western. </p>
<p>Minneapolis   &mdash;   or for that matter, any other American city   &mdash;   needs more of these people because WHY? </p>
<p>The benefit we&rsquo;re supposed to be getting from their presence here is WHAT? </p>
<p>And our current immigration czars are going to acknowledge and address the Somali problem WHEN? <br>

			<p> <i>On a few occasions, Somali male workers complained about having to take orders from female managers.</i> </p>
<p>Very interesting!  There you have two civil rights pressure groups coming into conflict: Women&rsquo;s rights vs. Moslem rights.  I&rsquo;d be curious to know how it turned out.</p>
<p><i>Once, as violence in Somalia intensified, a fight broke out on a job site between members of separate warring clans. The company held a training session on how to get along in the workplace, and the fighting stopped.</i></p>
<p>It should not be necessary for American firms to hold training classes in how warring clans should get along.</p>
<p>And consider what this nonsense is doing to profits. No wonder companies are relocating to China, where everyone is Chinese and everyone behaves according to one set of rules.</p>

<p><br>
Oh, PLEASE.  No one starves to death in America unless it&rsquo;s some poor child being tortured by a sicko adult.  </p>
<p>She can&rsquo;t get another job?  What, no food stamps?  Guess there are no churches in the area, no Salvation Army, no charities nor government bureaus, no support groups.  Poor little waif, must not have any relatives, friends, or fellow SOMALIANS in the &#8220;SOMALIAN Community&#8221; to lend a helping hand.  I thought Muslims were not supposed to let other Muslims go without, according to their superior religious principles.</p>
<p>This is so over the top.  Journalism has become the professional refuge of the insane.</p>

Translation: Their poor cutomer service skills make them umemployable in the interpersonal sector such as retail or food service etc. The article itself  seems to bear out my assertion by saying that in Somalia only people who push and shove to the front of the line can get served&hellip; Not exactly a glowing reference for airport staff in that country. </p>

			<p>They don&rsquo;t call Minneapolis &#8220;Minnedishu&#8221; or &#8220;Minneafrica&#8221; for nothing.   It seems like every store in inner city Minneapolis advertises goat meat for these people and parts of the city (like the &#8220;crack stacks&#8221;) now resemble the set for Black Hawk Down.    Pretty soon they&rsquo;re going to have to rename their football team to something more appropriate to the area&rsquo;s populace.<br>

			<p><i>&ldquo;At a Somali airport counter, he said, the only way to be served is to yell and push one&rsquo;s way through a crowd.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Colonel Gail Halvorsen, the Berlin Airlift &#8220;Candy Bomber,&#8221; said that one of the reasons he decided to parachute candy bars to the kids of West Berlin was that he found out how polite they were - they didn&rsquo;t push, waited their turn, and those who did get candy shared with those who didn&rsquo;t. Before the Airlift he had been stationed for a time in Africa and he found that when he passed out candy bars to the African kids they would push, shove, harrass, and would never share.</p>
<p>He said this in an interview for the documentary on the 50th anniversary of the Berlin Airlift (I believe it was produced by CNN). I&rsquo;m surprised they didn&rsquo;t cut that comment out.</p>

			<p>I suggest all the plants with Muslim employees, close and then open under new management and re-hire now employees and find some way to keep the Muslims out of the work force. I worked for a man once who managed a large, very profitable family business in S.C. and during employee problems (he paid top wages) he told the people that he had enough money to live as a multi billionaire for the rest of his life and if these protests and problems persisted he would close the plant, sell the assets and they would have no jobs. The problems went away. Maybe this plant in question should move to Mexico.</p>

			<p>The somalis should never have been imported here to begin with. Importing Africans into the NorthEast resulted in Maine&rsquo;s local governments complaining that their welfare systems were stretched to the breaking point. Rallys and marches against Somali immigration occurred there in 2003. Some of the Somali youth have formed streetgangs today and also in the UK. Trolling the world looking for the poorest least desirable immigrants to import to grow the neo-liberal welfare state needs to end. </p>

			<p>Why are these people allowed in?  Being an American citizen and being in America should be something special, reserved only for those who were born here of American parents.  I think we really went off the rails when people decided that it would be great for everyone in the world to be American and have a shot at coming here.   This diluted the &#8216;brand&rsquo; and greatly diminished its value.  </p>

			<p> In the auto plants they would do their prayers on the floor at their work station. Talk about dangerous you would come around the car and they are on the floor and if you didn,t see them you would trip over them. Where is osha? This just shows a multicultural country can,t and won,t work. At the rate of immigration and them having children we all will be replaced. This govt. is all wrong about this stuff but it don,t change it gets worse. It,s no wonder they have closed 39 auto plants and GM is supposed to close 4more suv plants. Multiculturism doesn,t work and never will. It looks like the govt. knows this and is trying to destroy this country. For what purpose i don,t know. But they,re doing a good job of it. When i was little we used to get surplus food but it would run out at the end of the month and we would go hungry and have nothing to eat for about five days. Maybe you wouldn,t starve but you sure would go hungry.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Many Somalis come from tribes that move with their herds every six months in a constant search for safe grazing land, Sheikhosman said. Many of these nomads are fiercely independent and equate freedom with being left alone, he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The abject ludicrousness of that statement is both amusing and appalling!</p>
<p>The humor first. </p>
<p>It is found in asking one question; that question is this, are there any people on the face of the earth, that make the case better for why racial diversity is anything other than a &ldquo;strength,&rdquo; than do the Somalis? Grotesque and dull witted in appearance, beyond alien in beliefs and behaviors, and costly with regard to both the public and private sectors, they are simply an exemplary cornucopia of just how &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; a gift Third World diversity is for the West and the USA. </p>
<p>Jeepers, and unlike most &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; they don&rsquo;t even come with return slips!</p>
<p>Then the horror.</p>
<p>Could there be any more ironically germane phrase then that these Somalis: &ldquo;equate freedom with being left alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, they have come to the wrong country and for that matter (given the other white countries&rsquo; even more radical speech and &ldquo;equality&rdquo; laws) civilization, if they want to be &ldquo;left alone.&rdquo; Sure, they will get away with their fanatical &ldquo;independence&rdquo; nonsense so long as it is only directed against whitey, but just wait till some Hmong or Xhosa gets offended because that is when the real &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; will hit the fan for them. </p>
<p>Oh, the humanity and &ldquo;rich&rdquo; complexity of it all!<br>

			<p>From 2001 through 2005, 81% of tuberculosis cases in Minnesota occurred in foreign-born persons; this finding can largely be attributed to dynamic immigration patterns that have included an influx of persons from areas of the world where tuberculosis is endemic.</p>

<p>Posted by at 11:58 AM on June 20 </p>
<p><br>
Let me tell you why: Because&hellip;</p>
<p>-&gt; Many whites - particularly those who live in their lilly majority-white suburbs without ever getting in contact with troublemaking immigrants, simply don´t experience the &#8220;fruits&#8221; of diversity fírst hand, so that for them no problems with(practically non-present) immigrants exist. And since the problem does not exist in their neighborhood, why moving their butt and wasting time for an issue that is considered &#8220;racist&#8221;?<br>
-&gt; Those who are aware about the problem keep a low profile because they are anxious of losing their job or their reputation when anyone gets known about their involvement in &#8220;racist&#8221; anti-immigration movements who demand expulsion of unassimilable immigrants.<br>
-&gt; The youth and the kids rather think about their new PC game and how to get through it, and they never read news. (Even the majority of adults don´t get access to news like this)<br>
-&gt; Students are too busy doing their study (best case) and arranging the next football and alcohol party (usual case). Is there time left to read such news for them? Is it worth spending time on it? Haven´t they been tought that diversity is a strength? Any articles that show it´s not never reach the universities and thus don´t ever get attention from students.<br>
They think rather about today, not about tomorrow and even less about their kids, but rather about sex, party, alcohol and fun.<br>
I bet many of them plan to travel and move somewhere in the future - and this mindset cuts the awareness of responsibility for defending the own homestate/country.</p>
<p>I could go on dozens of pages explaining why, but you might see that liberalism has made people - who have the numbers - thinking about how to get out most of &#8220;fun&#8221; and &#8220;enjoyment&#8221; today rather than thinking about their and their kids´ environment (safety, education, job offers) in the future.<br>
They think they can move wherever and whenever they want and that they will be welcome everywhere, but they forget that living space, jobs and other resources are limited.</p>

That&rsquo;s BECAUSE we have gotten to know them, and don&rsquo;t WANT THEM!</p>
<p>Lutheran Social Service (LSS) one of the nation&rsquo;s premier cultural transformation centers, NEVER ONCE ASKED MINNESOTANS if they wanted thousands of Laotions, and Hmong, thirty years ago.</p>

 I count them my enemies&rdquo;<br>
-Psalm 139: 21-22</p>
<p>And, lest some idiot dare tell me that &#8216;Christ told us to love our enemies,&rsquo; (and He did) here is the limit of that &#8216;love&rsquo;-St. Theodosius of the Kiev Caves Lavra stated:<br>

I think you are generally right, Ziwtra.  Upper Midwesterners generally don&rsquo;t deal with blacks on a daily basis unless they live or work in the large cities, like Chicago, Milwaukee, or Minneapolis.  So, their perception of blacks is largely based on what they see on television.  Not good.</p>
<p>As someone who has lived in both Minnesota and Wisconsin, I can tell you first-hand that whites in the Upper Midwest tend to be good, kind-hearted, and moral people, particularly in the rural areas.  However, they tend to be naive about racial matters, and they tend to be rather provincial in their worldview.  In other words, if they hear about racial tension in, say, Los Angeles, they tend to shrug their shoulders as if that sort of tension cannot occur in their neck of the woods.</p>

<p>This will make these people prime targets when the teeming masses of thugs leave the cities and begin to pillage, loot, rob, rape and murder in the countryside, spreading ever further from their city bases. This IS going to happen.</p>

			<p>Toronto, Canada has a neighborhood called &#8220;Somali Alley&#8221; which I have had the unpleasant experience to visit on business. It is now considered the cities second most dangerous area for Whites to be in. The &#8220;Jane &amp; Finch&#8221; neighborhood which is Jamaican Black is still the area Whites should avoid at all cost, with a crime rate second to none in all of Canada. White flight is a fact of life in all our cities, but liberals will never admit it. Multiculturalism is still as our &#8220;greatest strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to my Microsoft word thesaurus &ldquo;white flight&rdquo; is especially due to racism, but what is essentially taking place is a phenomenon known as in country refugee that especially affects European Americans in the United States.  As people of color move into a white neighbor crimes against whites occur in significant numbers; schools become an intolerant setting of acceptance for white students, white students are harassed personally and physically, shopping at stores and traveling about on public transportation becomes a hostile environment against your person and property. Why is the European American being accused of white flight?<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s time these goat-herders moved along to the next watering-hole. Preferably somewhere closer to their polygamy-ridden tribal homeland. </p>
<p>Strange isn&rsquo;t it that although the egalitarian Left praise mass immigration to Western countries and decry those that oppose it as racists, knuckle-draggers etc., the same neo-Marxists are full of praise for pure, socialist states like Cuba &amp; are silent as Marxist states like Cuba shun mass immigration like they would shun the plague. Could this be because a continuous influx of foreign-born would deprive Castro&rsquo;s Communist dictatorship of their iron grip on the country.</p>
<p>Yes, mass immigration is a Marxist nuclear bomb aimed at white Western societies only, to bring about Marxism&rsquo;s oft-stated aim, the destruction of Western civilisation.</p>
<p>The following quote is from a comment on the BNP site &amp; is an example of the kind of deranged mind that created this whole deranged egalitarian claptrap in the first place &amp; proves that these nation-wrecking events are &#8216;not just happening&rsquo; but are part of a world-wide conspiracy. Here are excerpts from a speech made by Lavrenti Beria, the head of the NKVD, to a group of US communist students at Lenin University in 1953.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Degradation and conquest are companions. To be conquered, a nation must be degraded&hellip;degradation can be accomplished insidiously&hellip;and effectively by consistent and continual defamation&hellip;continued and constant degradation of national leaders, national institutions, national practices and national heroes must be systematically carried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By attacking the character and morals&hellip;by bringing about, through contamination of youth, a general degraded feeling, command of the populace is facilitated to a very marked degree. The attack on the mind of a nation involves changing loyalties, we must have a command of their values.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By perverting the institutions of a nation and bringing about a general degradation&hellip;a population can be brought psychologically to heel&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only the mind of a Marxist could produce such demented hatred of the human race.</p>
