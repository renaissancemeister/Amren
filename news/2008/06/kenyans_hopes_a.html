						<p>Hoisting plastic cups of &#8220;Obama&#8221; beer and gathering around television sets, Kenyans celebrated Wednesday as Barack Obama laid claim to the U.S. Democratic presidential nomination. </p>
<p>Some hoped for promises of more U.S. aid to Africa, while others simply wanted to bask in the glory of a successful black politician with Kenyan roots. And in this region of western Kenya, where the candidate is seen as a local son, Obama&rsquo;s Kenyan relatives described him as a great hope for both Kenya and the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be good if he becomes president of the United States,&#8221; Obama&rsquo;s step-grandmother, Sarah Hussein Obama, told The Associated Press in her tribal language, Luo. &#8220;Barack could help build schools in Kenya, hospitals, help the orphans here. It would be a blessing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;God willing, I would like Mr. Obama to be the first black African to be president of the United States,&#8221; said William Ochieng, who was among a crowd in Kisumu toasting Obama with a brew called Senator Keg  &mdash;  nicknamed &#8220;Obama&#8221; beer since the U.S. senator&rsquo;s presidential campaign took off.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barack Obama has visited his Kenyan relatives three times in Kogelo, and his step-grandmother has gone to the U.S. twice. She says they are close, although they have to speak through an interpreter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prime Minister Raila Odinga said Obama&rsquo;s success was &#8220;a momentous occasion in history.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today marks a pivotal moment for the United States. The decision by the white majority electorate to vote for an African-American for such an august position is a vibrant indicator of the long distance the US has traveled from its history of slavery and racial discrimination,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>{snip} Mutua did not comment on the election Wednesday, but Assistant Foreign Affairs Minister Richard Onyonka said the candidate was &#8220;a son of Kenya.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that he will not forget Kenya when he becomes president,&#8221; Onyonka said. &#8220;He will be much more receptive to African issues. Africa needs somebody who understands Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>It keeps getting funnier and funnier.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no equivocating here nor is there any effort to be subtle.  They come right out and say they expect their boy to get into the leadership role of a foreign country just so he can give them freebies.</p>
<p>And John Kennedy was expected by the Irish to give them what they want?  Of course not.  Such silliness is only the product of black minds.</p>
<p>Obamanation will be too busy here in this country forcing blacks into schools and high paying employment, so everybody will know blacks are on a par with whites in all respects, to give more than a few billion to his Kenyan kinfolk. </p>
<p>Proving that blacks are just as smart as whites will be his goal.  Just look at his brilliant wife.  $360,000 per year for his wife in a position she would have problems qualifying for to be the maid. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s all about Africans and how we can offer them prosperity.  Aren&rsquo;t AMERICAN blacks already &#8220;entitled&#8221; to receive everything we can afford?  </p>
<p>Getting more involved over there will be a slippery slope indeed.  Globalization, multi-culturalism, and Third World influence will enter a whole new dark dimension.</p>
<p>And it sounds like both political parties are itching for some action in Darfur.  </p>

			<p>If Obama wins it will be a major disaster for all of us.</p>
<p>Some people here claim that if he wins it will be a benefit to race realism, but I have to disagree.  I think the real wake-up call will be if he loses and the reaction from the likes of these people.</p>

			<p>I wonder how many Somali/Kenyan &#8216;refugees&rsquo; Obama will allow into the United States? Lewiston, Columbus, Shelbyville, and Minneapolis are already overrun, but there are so many other places to go to. I fear that an Obama presidency will result in economic and immigration-related disaster for America, resulting in an exodus of whites. On the other hand, if he doesn&rsquo;t win the presidency, blacks will go ballistic, making the L.A. riots of 1992 seem like a walk through the park by comparison. Either way, Obama is bad news for America.</p>

			<p> Why does it NEVER enter the &#8220;African mindset&#8221; to build their own hospitals and schools and take care of THEIR orphans THEMSELVES!!!! As long as I&rsquo;ve been alive Africans have ALWAYS depended on the evil &#8220;racissss&#8221; White folks to do everything for them, while at the same time violently kicking Whites out of their countries. So,Prime Minister Raila Odinga, when can we expect the blacks of Kenya to elect a WHITE Prime Minister? That would be a &#8220;vibrant indicator of the long distance Kenya has traveled from its history of racial discrimination against Whites.&#8221; And as far as &#8220;Africa needs somebody who understands Africa- - - trust me, most Americans &#8220;understands&#8221; Africa but unfortunately our &#8220;leaders&#8221; don&rsquo;t have a clue!!!!!</p>

<p>Laughing out loud!</p>
<p>America needs someone who &ldquo;understands Africa&rdquo; all right, and that would not be Comrade BO.</p>
<p>An American President that understood Africa, really understood it, would cut off all aid and let it rot under the weight of its own incompetence and tribalism. He would also restrict all immigration from that continent, except for the few whites remaining there. Or better still, would undue the mistakes of the 70s through 90s and reestablish through military force Apartheid in South Africa; Also, the ANC would be eradicated there, along with Comrade Mugabe and his cronies in Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>Indeed, that would at least be a good and very understanding start!</p>

			<p>The only thing America or any Euro-based culture could &#8220;do&#8221; for Africa would be to recolonize and take control of it.  Black Africa&rsquo;s one and only hey-day came in the first half of the 20th Century.</p>
<p>Following WW II and the end of colonialism throughout Africa, the Dark Continent quickly reverted to the tribal savagery that has characterized its entire history.  That&rsquo;s not conjecture. It&rsquo;s simply the dismal truth.</p>
<p>While it appears to be true that there are considerable differences in temperament, intelligence, and capability between different groups or tribal factions throughout Africa, it&rsquo;s equally true that on balance black Africans are on the bottom of the social, economic, and cultural ladder wherever they&rsquo;ve found.<br>
There&rsquo;s nothing whatever that Obama and his worshipful followers can or will do to change that. </p>

			<p>Wow&hellip;this article says it all.  As if it isn&rsquo;t bad enough that we have blacks in America who think B. Hussein Obama will solve all of their problems and finally help them get a &#8220;piece of the pie&#8221;, now we have black Africans thinking the same thing!  Don&rsquo;t we already give HUGE amounts of &#8220;aid&#8221;, (nice way of saying that the government has stolen from its citizens to give money away to the citizens of another country), to various countries throughout Africa?  Where are all of the hospitals, schools, shopping centers, factories to employ the masses, homes, (instead of huts)?  Uh&hellip;I don&rsquo;t see any.  Huh&hellip;wonder where all of that &#8220;aid&#8221; is going to then?  Oh&hellip;that&rsquo;s right&hellip;it goes to line the pockets of the tribal leaders and warlords who then screw their own people out of their portion of the &#8220;aid&#8221;.  Lest we forget that it was these same kind of leaders and warlords who sold their own people into slavery in the first place!  I know the &#8220;character&#8221; of blacks.  They have very little to none!  They&rsquo;ll kill their own mother for the last $20 in her purse! What&rsquo;s even more infuriating is that despite the fact that this is a well-known fact, the idiots in control of this country continue to send more and more &#8220;aid&#8221; each year!  God knows it&rsquo;s only going to get much worse if B. Hussein Obama becomes the president!  I live in Charleston, SC.  I know a thing or two about what kind of &#8220;leaders&#8221; blacks are once they obtain a position of power.  It isn&rsquo;t pretty.  They&rsquo;re incompetent, greedy, and always crying racism whenever they eventually get investigated for either embezzlement or misappropriation of funds.  God help us&hellip;we&rsquo;re just months away from possibly having one of them in the highest office in the land.         </p>

			<p>Here is a great article researching the truth about Barack Obama&rsquo;s supposedly noble Black Kenyan father.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-431908/A-drunk-bigot--US-Presidental-hopeful-HASNT-said-father-.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-431908/A-drunk-bigot  &mdash;  US-Presidental-hopeful-HASNT-said-father-.html</a></p>
<p>Barack&rsquo;s father - not really a father, more like a sperm donor, statutory rapist (Barack&rsquo;s idiot White Lefty mother was 17 when she got knocked up) was a bigomist, drunk, wife beater (he had many wives, including another idiot White American leftist he brought back from Harvard to Kenya).</p>
<p>Please send this link, article to everyone you know and explain the truth that Barack&rsquo;s autobiogropahy is a fraud. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Some hoped for promises of more aid for Africa&#8221; as they rattle their collective beggar bowls at White America once again. I say FORGET about trying to help Africa. It simply can&rsquo;t be done!</p>
<p>You could sink a hundred billion dollars into Black Africa and not a decade later, have the same beggar bowls waved at the world. Crime, corruption, squallor, disease and despair is the NORMAL AFRICAN WAY OF LIFE!</p>
<p>People engaging in endless tribal warfare. Stupidly,  outbreeding available food supplies and production capability. Killing each other over the slightest pretext.</p>
<p>To &#8220;teach&#8221; the native population the &#8220;true&#8221; version of African history. How to build great cities and architectural wonders. To lead them into a bright new future(LOL). Has anyone besides myself noticed the parallel between Black Africans and their kin in Europe, the Caribbean, and of course, the Americas&hellip; their dysfunctionality. Their inability to make any real progress. Their predisposition to crime and mindless violence.</p>
<p>Come to think of it&hellip; DOES ANY RATIONAL AMERICAN really WANT Obama, an established liar, a Muslim. A man with at best a dismal record as Senator to be elected President. A man devoid of experience. Who&rsquo;s only strong presidential qualifications are a charismatic(?) personality fit to hoodwink young Americans into foolishly believing his empty phrases and vague promises of how he&rsquo;d &#8220;fix&#8221; the world&rsquo;s problems.</p>

<p>I thought the same thing, &#8220;How can an American president have Kenyan roots?&#8221;  The maddening part of this whole ordeal is that he is half-Kenyan; not some distant relative, but a full 50 percent.  </p>
<p>In terms of spending, BHO will feel free to use your&rsquo;s and my tax dollars with even more recklessness than Americans have ever seen.  </p>
<p>What better way to cure ghetto ills than with a billion, handed-out tax dollars?</p>
<p>What better way to keep black men with their &#8220;baby-mommas&#8221; then a few hundred million?</p>
<p>What better way to narrow the educational achievement gap than huge goverment oversite, and programs on top of programs that require &#8220;emergency spending bills&#8221; to be passed in the wee hours of the night?</p>
<p>Since America&rsquo;s prison population is over 40% &#8220;of African roots,&#8221; then what better way to fill outreach and second chance programs with &#8220;newly exonerated&#8221; ex-cons, that happen to have sued &#8220;da man&#8221; for civil rights violations, at taxpayers expense?</p>
<p>And the list goes on&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those our only some of the domestic goals, and with all of this comes the need for even more incompotent goverment workers.  The best and the brightest will not be running the show, as we see from how incompetent our Federal goverment already is.</p>

<p>Be careful what you wish for, Grandma. The hospitals, orphanages and above all the schools run by the government over here are hardly glowing examples of efficacy and efficiency.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a novel thought: why don&rsquo;t you build your own damned schools, hospitals and orphanages?</p>

			<p>Considering that his Kenyan relatives never gave him a dime of support or even knew he existed till he became a US Senator it is a little bit much.</p>
<p>Believe me, if it had not been for his millionaire marxist white grandparents, Obama would have been raised either in the projects with his mother or in the horrible foster home system.</p>

			<p>So now we&rsquo;re going to let Kenyans dictate our policy? What have they to offer besides gross poverty, tribalism, AIDS, and a high rate of crime in all regions. Is this Obama&rsquo;s plan to make the USA Africa&rsquo;s policeman?</p>

<b>*cha-ching*</b></p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s the expectation.</p>
<p>If nothing else, an Obama presidency would give us a taste of where the far left loyalties are. What Obama proposes and what he can deliver are two different things.<br>

			<p>In the early 1990&rsquo;s, the area of unincorporated San Mateo, California know as East Palo Alto decided to incorporate. The largely black residents voted in favor of the resolution, and the City Of East Palo Alto was born on June 1, 1983.</p>
<p>On May 31st, 1983 <i>every</i> bank branch closed, the major supermarket chain closed its only EPA outlet. The sheriff&rsquo;s office and California Highway Patrol personnel were told to stay OUT of that city unless the new EPA P.D. officers were actually taking fire. A city of three square miles soon recorded 42 murders in one year. EPD P.D. would be working the crime scene at one murder, only to be forced to break away to handle a second murder. One notable incident took place after a Hispanic driver was involved in a minor traffic accident at one of the city&rsquo;s major intersections. A mob quickly assembled, dragged the man out of his car, and beat him senseless. They then overturned his car and set it on fire. Meanwhile, the newly elected black city government commenced to looting the city&rsquo;s general fund.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of this? Now you know what an Obama presidency will look like, on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>So typical of African thinking. Whenever an African is elected in America, the first thing his constituents think about is getting handouts. Now Africans in Africa are expecting the same. </p>

			<p>To understand africa we would need to spend 50 trillion dollars educating White Americans just to get a fundamental grasp of the african psyche, then another 50 trillion dollars to understand what the conversion of africa to World standards would entail, then another 50 trillion to employ psychiatric procedures on said Whites for all the trauma caused.</p>

			<p>This is the only way that John McCain could ever get elected to the office of president, by having an opponent so obviously bad for the country. After the Democrat convention, the media will let Obama&rsquo;s cat out of the bag, and then McCain will win. It&rsquo;s not a coincidence. It&rsquo;s the American [media] way.</p>

			<p> If elected, Senator Obama will act as an immigration magnet for Africans. Perhaps, the United States will be the new destination of choice for Africans rather than Europe. Many Africans will dream of having a child by a white American woman who will grow up to be a future American president. The dream of the elimination of racism through miscegenation will be given an enormous boost in the short term. Moreover, the naïve American public will finally experience a black president for the first time, and be surprized by the result.  </p>

<p>The American media will never let any of Obama&rsquo;s cats out of the bag. They will fight to keep those cats in the bag. The US media is very pro-Obama. They will do everything they can to help him win.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out who the millions of South Asians (Hindu and Sikh), East/South East Asians, and Latinos have been voting for, assuming a sizeable number of them do actually use their votes.</p>
<p>In view of their collective impact on the election scene one wouldn&rsquo;t expect to see a half Kenyan <i>Muslim</i> mulatto leading the pack at the moment. </p>
<p>Something tells me this particular race for the White House has more shades of corruption AND fix in because of melamin. <br>

			<p>The ONLY WAY (tongue-in-cheek) you could FIX Africa&rsquo;s never-ending problems would be by forcibly sterilizing ALL Blacks. Then letting time take care of the problem! As long as we have Black Africans, we will have crime, poverty, squallor, disease, stupidity and outbreeding their natural resources and food supply. No, Blacks could NEVER admit it, but were nevertheless far better off under White rule (colonialism). If you disbelieve it, look at the hopeless mess in today&rsquo;s &#8220;enlightened&#8221; Africa. Zimbabwe, Ruwan, Darfur, Ethiopia&hellip; . the list goes on and on.</p>

			<p>About five years ago British TV featured a documentary about  some smart-ass liberal British lawyers who got together in Kenya &amp; produced a couple of female Africans who claimed they had been raped by British soldiers stationed in Kenya for training or manouvers or some such reason. They asked for more &#8216;victims&rsquo; to come forward so the crimes could be investigated &amp; compensation would be awarded. They set up headqurters in a wooden hut in a village &amp; the film showed a line leading from the hut right through the village &amp; up through the path into the distant hillsides &amp; beyond. There was literally thousands &amp; thousands of Kenyan women all lining-up for their share of the white man&rsquo;s generous bounty. </p>
<p>I reckon the British government were having kittens at the amount of compensation they&rsquo;d have to pay out for these supposed rapes &amp; must have scared off these bloodsucking lawyers with a warning to charge them with fraud &#8216;cause I never heard another word about this terrible mass outrage on the TV or in the newspapers ever again.</p>
<p>I reckon you American folks had better prepare to stop Obama&rsquo;s 10,000 or so relatives arriving on your shores expecting a large helping of American largesse. It&rsquo;s either that or get youselves involved in the bed &amp; breakfast business.</p>
<p>When will it ever end? Only when we put a stop to the madness. I believe here in the UK, slowly but surely, more &amp; more people are becoming aware of the insanity of liberal-induced multiculturalism &amp; mass immigration.</p>
