				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Blankstein, Los Angeles Times, June 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Even as gang-related homicides have been dropping in the last several years, the proportion of such killings in which race was a factor has increased, Los Angeles County sheriff&rsquo;s officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s homicide investigators reported that race &#8220;played a role&#8221; in 16% of the 207 gang-related killings in 2005, rising to 19% of 133 gang slayings last year, said sheriff&rsquo;s spokesman Steve Whitmore.</p>
<p>In the first six months of this year, 25% of the 56 gang-related slayings involved either blacks killing Latinos or vice versa.</p>
<p>That compares with 13% for the same period last year.</p>
<p>Whitmore said officials examined all gang-related homicides over the last three years, in jurisdictions where the department investigates those crimes, to determine what role, if any, racial hatred played. Whitmore said it is as much an element in the slayings as such other factors as gang clashes, drugs and turf.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Los Angeles Police Department officials have disputed that contention, saying race remains a rare factor in gang killings.</p>
<p>A Times examination of slayings in 2007 largely backed Police Chief William J. Bratton&rsquo;s assertion about the racial factor in gang killings.</p>
<p>The Times analyzed the circumstances of 562 Latino and black homicides from 2007 in which the race of the suspects was known, including all LAPD and sheriff&rsquo;s cases, plus those of smaller police agencies such as Long Beach and Inglewood.</p>
<p>The analysis found that nearly 90% of both black and Latino homicide victims had been killed by suspects of their own race.</p>
<p>Last week, Baca wrote in a Los Angeles Times opinion piece that &#8220;some of L.A.&rsquo;s so-called gangs are really no more than loose-knit bands of blacks or Latinos roaming the streets looking for people of the other color to shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the piece, the sheriff argued that the same racial animosity that was permeating the county jail system was spilling onto the streets of Los Angeles County.</p>

Southern California &#8220;Blacks&#8221; seem genuinely surprised that the Latinos stand their ground and fight back rather than to flee the area as the White people did. That should be a lesson for White people who still reside elswhere.</p>

			<p>As one race pushes another out of an area, the total number of gang members drops, so the total murder rate drops.  However, those people simply move to a different area&hellip;.and commit their murders there.  Probably, if you checked the surrounding counties to LA, their murder rates have risen.</p>

			<p>This is an excellent example of the attitude and conduct of white liberals who know that their careers are based on how greatly they adopt diversity and deny its debilitating effects on society.</p>
<p>That they could very well be responsible, through misrepresentation, for the deaths of people, I&rsquo;m pretty sure  doesn&rsquo;t cost them a minute&rsquo;s sleep at night.</p>
<p>Their crimes are further magnified by getting support from a &#8220;diversity first&#8221; liberal rag like the L.A. Times that has no compunction about shading the truth, exaggerating or lying outright if they believe it advances their perverted ideologies.</p>
<p>A democratic Republic in action is slowing revealing to us that it doesn&rsquo;t work much better than totalitarianism, because it&rsquo;s so easy for ideologues to control the prevailing thought on almost any subject, so long as they have a near monopoly on the organs of communications, and can get enough of the population to go along with anything they want.</p>
<p>Covering up a racial war in progress, only serves to allow it to grow and spread more quickly.</p>

			<p>The author of this piece seems to not know the difference between a &#8220;suspect&#8221; and a &#8220;perpetrator.&#8221;  A suspect is a person who you think might have committed a crime. A perpetrator is a person who did commit a crime. </p>
<p>To say &#8220;the race of the suspect was not known&#8221; is like saying &#8220;the person we suspect of committing this crime is someone we haven&rsquo;t identified yet.&#8221; <i>Say what?</i></p>
<p>Hey LA Times, please come to Amren for basic journalism lessons.<br>

			<p>I know.. I know.. but believe it or not, unlike California&rsquo;s civil and judicial government, the LAPD actually has some very bright people at the top. But they can&rsquo;t change reality and they are under the civil and judicial authorities. </p>
<p>It looks like the cover is coming off the racial crime problem in Los Angeles finally. Until this state moves out of denial, things won&rsquo;t change. So it&rsquo;s good to see they are actually reporting the problem now and sharing the statistics. </p>

			<p>The blacks are all very sure the white man is afraid of them and in some cases I think they are right. Whites give in and give up way to easy anymore. If todays whites were the original settlers we would have a native American giving the orders. But the Mexican is a different breed and when the blacks try wuing the games they do to scare whites the Mexican cuts the blacks throat from ear to ear then sits down to enjoy a taco. We could learn a lot from our south of the border invaders?</p>

			<p>Can we consider the Roman empire as a model of what &#8216;diversity&rsquo; can do to a country/empire. I suspect many amren readers know some of Roman history and I see a great similarity between Rome and the U.S. But the big difference is that our barbarians did not come storming the gates, traitors let them in through the sallie ports (customs) and now we are being over run from within, but over run nontheless.</p>

<p>   -&#8220;Thier ground&#8221;?  The Latinos are the invaders pushing Blacks out, they are not standing thier ground.  Nobody can stand ground in the face of a massive invasion.</p>

			<p>The fatuation many on this forum seem to have with the latino is unfounded imho. You forget they gladly do the same to us daily here in the SouthWest. They jacked my 83 year old grandmother&rsquo;s car, broke into her house, broke into my parent&rsquo;s house and robbed it twice over the years, beat down my Uncle Pete in his own front yard because he wouldn&rsquo;t do what they told him to, etc&hellip; I&rsquo;ve had to defend myself twice growing up here from crazed latinos. They sell drugs, just like blacks do, in schools and the neighborhoods and have formed more gangs than the blacks here. </p>
<p>You celebrate their behavior toward the blacks forgetting the same behavior is played out against the minority of whites.</p>
<p>For those of you who think what&rsquo;s happening with the latino demographic because of some wingnut AB and EME working partnership that existed in the 60&rsquo;s - 90&rsquo;s but is breaking down today in many respects is fine: you are very mistaken.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re surrounded and victimized politically, economically, and criminally by barbarian hordes of latinos. So you sit down and enjoy a taco with them. I just want them to leave. </p>

			<p>8:28 PM hit the nail on the head.  By forcibly displacing black street thugs, the Mexicans in L.A. are not pacifying them; they are merely moving them and their crime elsewhere.  We saw exactly this happen in Houston, after it was flooded with New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>An article I once read said a lot of black L.A. residents were moving to Atlanta.  Look for violence to escalate there, especially given the east coast vs. west coast rivalry many of them subscribe to.</p>

I agree 100 percent.  I think the similarities between the US and ancient Rome are amazing.  I think Bush and Obama are going to be seen as the last, half-mad emperors ruling over a fading empire, before the US mutates into something else.  I think we eventually will decide the American dream is over and break up into separate enclaves.  </p>

<p>I think that their aggressiveness vis-a-vis blacks seems to be proportionate to the degree that they outnumber them. The Mexicans in my town in the deep south seem pretty frightened of blacks generally.</p>

<p>With good reason, because they would get the heck beaten out of them.</p>

			<p>The Black &#8220;Power Structure&#8221; in Los Angeles County is responsbile for much of the ethnic cleansing that blacks are experiencing. Writers like Earl Ofari Hutchinson, Politicians like Dianne Watson, Nat Holden, Ex Police Chief Parks, and activists like Tony Mohammed and other black activists have been totally absent where fighting for blacks in Los Angeles County is concerned. They are all still too busy trying to &#8220;keep an eye on whitey&#8221;, and what he is &#8220;doing&#8221;. I don&rsquo;t care if this offends some people, I have lived in California and in Los Angeles County for many years and have followed the cynical(oxymoron?)politicis that is played here. I know I&rsquo;m right about this stuff. </p>
