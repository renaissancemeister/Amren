			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Herald-Sun (Melbourne), June 06, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>RACIAL tension may have been behind a brawl this week when taxi drivers turned on each other outside a Tullamarine cafe.</p>
<p>Up to 30 drivers, some brandishing weapons, spilled onto Melrose Drive from the Melrose Lounge, a witness said. </p>
<p>A 25-year-old man was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with a cut above his eye, bruising and swelling. </p>
<p>It was initially suggested the fight was between Sudanese and Indian drivers. </p>
<p>However, other witnesses said the fight began between a Somalian driver and an Indian driver before mushrooming into a brawl between Indians and drivers from various African nations. </p>
<p>A leader in the recent taxi protests in Melbourne&rsquo;s CBD told 3AW the fight was sparked when an Indian driver tried to skip the queue. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian driver tried to jump the queue, and one of the Somalian drivers said, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t jump the queue, you have to do the right thing, this is wrong&rsquo;, and they started fighting.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Other taxi drivers and airport staff claimed racial tensions were often evident at the airport rank, with queue-jumping enough to spark mass arguments and violence. </p>
<p>Taxi driver Nabjot Gall said the fight broke out just before 8pm Wednesday. </p>
<p>Drivers used carjacks as weapons and one man was smashed in the face, he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The fight went on and got bigger and bigger,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>An Australia Federal Police officer confirmed members attended a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; incident at the cafe, but refused to comment further.</p>
