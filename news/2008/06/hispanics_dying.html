<h1><a href="http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=106&amp;sid=1416127">Hispanics Dying on Job at Higher Rates Than Others</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Stobbe, AP, June 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanic workers die at higher rates than other laborers, with 1 in 3 of these deaths occurring in the construction industry, a government study reported Thursday.</p>
<p>Hispanics tend to hold more high-risk jobs than those in other racial groups, but language and literacy barriers and poor training and supervision may also be factors, researchers said. The leading causes of death in recent years have been falls and highway-related accidents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study was done by health researchers in Massachusetts, Michigan and New Jersey and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It&rsquo;s being published this week in the CDC&rsquo;s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p>
<p>The study counted more than 11,000 Hispanic work-related deaths nationwide from 1992-2006. The data were culled from death certificates, police reports, workers&rsquo; compensation reports and other sources.</p>
<p>The researchers calculated an annual death rate of 5 per 100,000 Hispanic workers in 2006. But the rate for foreign-born Hispanics, roughly 6 per 100,000, was far higher than the 3.5 for those born in the United States.</p>
<p>The rate for non-Hispanic white workers was 4. For blacks, it was 3.7.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From 1992-96, murder on the job was the most common cause of death among Hispanic workers, with crimes like convenience store robberies contributing heavily to that tally.</p>
<p>Then highway accidents became the leading type of work-related fatality. Falls also have become common, and were the leading cause of death in 2000 and 2006.</p>
<p>An analysis of the most recent deaths, from 2003-06, found that 2 of every 3 Hispanic workers who died on the job were foreign-born. That&rsquo;s up from 1992, when immigrants accounted for about half of Hispanic work-related deaths.</p>
<p>In recent years, about 70 percent of the foreign-born fatalities were from Mexico.</p>

			<p>It has been argued that many Hispanics (mestizos) tend to be wreckless out of being macho.Such as driving drunk is considered manly.Me and my one year old son were almost killed by a horse being ridden by a drunken mexican.So the difference between whites and Hispanics is what we might consider to be stupid behavior.</p>

			<p>In Califormia recently. a 17 year old female  farm worker (probably illegal) who was pregnamnt with a would be anchor baby  died in the field because of heat exhaustion. Cry me a river.Her employer is being accused of not having enough agua in the field for all of the workers.Now they will have to pay out big bucks because she died. Cry me a river.But hispanics take more than their share of dangerous jobs, since illegals will take more risks. So hispanics dying at a higher rate should not be a surprise.</p>

Having a good understanding of english might help avert some deaths though I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re going to demand spanish speaking foremen and all instructions given in spanish.</p>

			<p>How many are legit? We all know of the workers comp fraud and lawsuits. Plus maybe Hispanics are more prone to do stupid things that cause their own &#8220;accidents&#8221;? </p>

			<p>Take their beer away! Every construction site I`ve seen has Mexicans on their payroll that do more drinking than actual work. In fact most job sites Ive been to have nothing but drunk Mexicans as a work force.  </p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s one encouraging thing about this article, it&rsquo;s a norwegian Color of Crime!</p>
<p>These sorts of facts are never published in the American press about American crime.  Even though they&rsquo;re giving lame excuses like &#8216;the evil norwegians aren&rsquo;t integrating immigrants well enough,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a big step over pure silence and censorship, just lying and pretending immigrants weren&rsquo;t criminals at all.</p>

			<p>There are so MANY Hispanics working labor jobs around here in The City Of New Brunswick, New Jersey, that perhaps there simply are more Hispanic employees.  Naturally, if most of the employees are Hispanics, most of the injured employees will be Hispanic. </p>
<p>It reminds me of the response to the claim that the New Jersey State Police Sex Offender Website&rsquo;s &#8220;Statistics&#8221; column on the web site menu showing the Counties with the most sex offenders are the Counties with the most Blacks and Hispanics because there is a huge population of Blacks and Hispanics in New Jersey.</p>

			<p>Many Mexicans won&rsquo;t wear glasses because they think they&rsquo;re for sissies, they&rsquo;d rather be blind.  Money is not the issue, you can get an eye exam and a pair of glasses at Costco or Walmart, cheap.  These people simply belong back on the rancho, not in a society that paves its roads.  </p>

			<p>The rate for non-Hispanic white workers was 4. For blacks, it was 3.7.<br>
 I think the figure is lower for blacks because fewer of them work. Pimps and drug dealers</p>

I don&rsquo;t usually like to re-use my comments from earlier articles. But as this story about construction accidents and fatalities is so similar to the previous day&rsquo;s &#8220;Survey: Risky Acts More Likely For Hispanic Teens,&#8221; I&rsquo;ll make an exception and repeat myself: </p>
<p>If these experts &#8220;unable to come up with an explanation for why Hispanic behavior trends differed&#8221; weren&rsquo;t wilfully blind liberal twits and Raza apologists, they&rsquo;d see that the explanation is right in front of their faces: It&rsquo;s the IQ Gap, stupid! </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not smart enough to avoid OBVIOUS danger, you will succumb to it. So if mestizos are exposing themselves to these OBVIOUS risks, and getting themselves needlessly killed in dumb ways, it only proves what &ldquo;The Godfather&rdquo; author Mario Puzo said in one of his book titles: &ldquo;FOOLS DIE&rdquo;<br>

			<p>&#8216;Murder on the job was the highest cause of Hispanic worker fatalty&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So an article ostensibly about the sad (and, alas, unavoidable) phenomenom of industrial injury gets conflated with acts of pure criminality.<br>
Is this yet another ruse to &#8216;mask&rsquo; the extent of minority criminality?</p>

			<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration set standards, known as their best practices for occupational safety. The basis behind this is that an american worker should be able to work their job and do it  so at the end of the shift they leave with all of their fingers and toes and havent picked up an chronic disease as a result of the work. This requires training and certification. The problem here is that the spanish language only has 1/3 of the words in the english language. It is very difficult to teach OSHA classes to hispanic workers when they dont understand the termanology, and dont try a teach through an enterprature that dosent work either. I know I teach more than 29 different OSHA required classes. This group of people is missing out on what could keep them alive. No wonder more of them are injured or killed as a result of their lack of understanding.</p>

			<p>Speaking of jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do, I observed an attempt around 6:30PM CST to run a scam near the Benito Juarez Academy in Chicago. Two Hispanic elementary-school age &#8220;youths,&#8221; one on a bicycle were at the intersection of Cermak &amp; Paulina. One of the &#8220;youths&#8221; hid behind a fence on Paulina, and when a black SUV was approaching the intersection he ran into the street and hit the side passenger rear door and slid into the street. The SUV driver went across the intersection and then stopped for a few moments in order to ascertain what happened. The boy had picked himself up and then ran off, accompanied by his buddy. As far as I could tell, the boy had miscalculated the speed of the SUV and instead of ending in front of the vehicle, he ended up in back of it. So you all be aware of Mexican scams here in the USA.</p>

			<p>I hate the unspoken deal we&rsquo;ve struck on illegal immigration in this country. </p>
<p>The deal: we get low-paid, unskilled helots that we can exploit in the short term; they get our country, long term. </p>
<p>This has to stop. </p>

			<p>They&rsquo;re here to &#8220;do jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221; - some of them because they are too dangerous.  And then, when the jobs turn out to actually *be* dangerous, the do-gooders get to work complaining about &#8220;inequality&#8221; and demanding perks for the immigrants that were never part of the original deal in letting them in &hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;So you all be aware of Mexican scams here in the USA.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a scam awhile back I heard about in truck driving school from the instructor. Cars would get ahead of your big rig then hit the break. It was especially big around Chicago, apparently. It would take a lot of bravery, or driving skill, to do that one. <br>

			<p>Last summer I saw a mexican cutting a 4ft by 8 ft piece of glass.  He was doing it in the street, between 2 parked cars.  He wore converse tennies, no goggles, no gloves, a short sleeved shirt.</p>
<p>The 8 ft long piece of glass was propped up on only 2 sawhorses, should have been 4.  And the guy was doing it alone.  No other workers were around.  That job required 3 people. One to cut and one on each end of the piece being cut.</p>
<p>He finished his first cut and surprise surpise!!!!!.  The bigger piece of glass fell off the sawhorse and broke.</p>
<p>His crooked contractor employer probably charged him for the broken glass, probably 3 times what the contractor paid for it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that if the mexican had asked for more sawhorses or some help, he would have been fired and replaced by the endless<br>
&#8220;reserve army&#8221; of mexicans desperate for work.</p>

			<p>How about &#8221; Hispanics &#8221; fleeing back to their beloved homelands were it would be much, much,much safer with far less motor vehicles to run them over or bridges to fall from . An ounce of prevention (fence/U.S. troops on our borders) is worth a pound of cure.</p>
