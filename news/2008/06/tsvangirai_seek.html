<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7469705.stm">Tsvangirai Seeks Embassy Refuge</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, June 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has taken refuge in the Dutch embassy in the capital, Harare.</p>
<p>A Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said Mr Tsvangirai had spent the night at the embassy as he feared for his safety but had not requested asylum.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he announced he was withdrawing from a presidential election run-off in the face of violence from ruling party militias.</p>
<p>Zimbabwean officials have said the second round will still go ahead.</p>
<p>But Botswana&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Pando Skelemani said leaders of the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) would have to decide whether Zimbabwe could have a legitimate president in the current political climate.</p>
<p>&#8220;If in fact the atmosphere for an election is not free and fair you then can&rsquo;t have someone having won,&#8221; he told the BBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be the same as if you had been through the election and they are declared not free and fair, then you are back at square one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ahead of a UN Security Council discussion about Zimbabwe, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s regime &#8220;cannot be considered legitimate in the absence of a run-off&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Tsvangirai says pressure from the UN and Sadc could force Mr Mugabe to give up power.</p>
<p>&#8220;My assessment is that if there is a collective position by all Sadc leaders, that would be sufficient pressure &mdash; that voice is essential,&#8221; he told US National Public Radio.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conditions of the Security Council on Zimbabwe has one outcome that we will expect &hellip;  to appoint a mission to investigate the level of abuses that have taken place &mdash; rape, torture, murder &mdash; and the various human rights abuse that has taken place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan told the BBC that he believed the elections should be postponed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, given what has happened, I doubt that anyone would accept the results, so they should put off the elections. But I think it is important that we all realise that Zimbabwe needs our help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa said Mr Tsvangirai&rsquo;s announcement of his withdrawal was a ruse as he had not sent a formal notice yet.</p>
<p><b>Arrests</b></p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Peter Biles in Johannesburg says Mr Tsvangirai is now considering his next move, but he remains in the Dutch compound.</p>
<p>Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said that if Mr Tsvangirai was looking for safety at the diplomatic mission, he was welcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve seen the last weeks a new low in the tortured history of Zimbabwe and I think that Mr Mugabe no longer has any moral legitimacy in the eyes of the people of Zimbabwe,&#8221; she told the BBC.</p>
<p>Mr Tsvangirai blames supporters of President Mugabe and the ruling Zanu-PF party for the death of 86 of his supporters in the run-up to the second-round, due to be held on Friday.</p>
<p>On Monday, more than 60 supporters of Mr Tsvangirai&rsquo;s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party were arrested at its Harare headquarters.</p>
<p>MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said those arrested were women and children who had fled political violence.</p>
<p>Zimbabwean police told AFP news agency they had only moved 39 people from the building for &#8220;hygiene reasons&#8221;.</p>
<p>President Mugabe and Zanu-PF blame the opposition for political violence across the country.</p>
<p>The MDC won the parliamentary vote in March, and claims to have won the first round of the presidential contest outright.</p>
<p>In the official results, Mr Tsvangirai led but failed to gain enough votes to avoid a run-off.<br>
