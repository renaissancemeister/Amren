<h1>Obama Says Republicans Will Use Race to Stoke Fear</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Caren Bohan, AP, June 20, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama said on Friday he expects Republicans to highlight the fact that he is black as part of an effort to make voters afraid of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is going to be very difficult for Republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy,&rdquo; Obama told a fundraiser in Jacksonville, Florida. &ldquo;We know what kind of campaign they&rsquo;re going to run. They&rsquo;re going to try to make you afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to try to make you afraid of me. He&rsquo;s young and inexperienced and he&rsquo;s got a funny name. And did I mention he&rsquo;s black?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he was also set for Republicans to say &#8220;he&rsquo;s got a feisty wife,&#8221; in trying to attack his wife Michelle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know the strategy because they&rsquo;ve already shown their cards. Ultimately I think the American people recognize that old stuff hasn&rsquo;t moved us forward. That old stuff just divides us,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>     If Obama is elected, we can expect such a strategy to get his programs through Congress, etc.  Actually, I have not yet heard the Republicans refer to his Blackness or his feisty wife.  </p>

			<p>Instead of complaining about what he takes to be the future Republican strategy, why doesn&rsquo;t Obama say something to reassure  white voters about the issues which he raises?  He is in fact inexperienced.  He does in fact have a funny name.  His wife is in fact an affirmative action product who considers whites essentially evil.  He has in fact indicated that whites should fear him for his commitment to expand affirmative action to their disadvantage.  The only point that he makes which is false is when he says that they will say, &#8220;And did I mention he&rsquo;s black?&rdquo;  Obama is not black.  He is a mulatto(half black and half white).  It is interesting that yet again he dismisses this fact and makes himself out to be simply &#8220;black&#8221;.  It must be utter agony for his wife, if she is bright enough to figure this out, to acknowledge that her children are also partly white.</p>

			<p>In a just world, in a sane world, Obama&rsquo;s candidacy would just have imploded. He&rsquo;s basically saying that opposing his election is &#8220;racist,&#8221; that the GOP is racist and that everybody who doesn&rsquo;t vote for him does so out of fear of the black man. His arrogance and sense of entitlement are truly astonishing.</p>

<p>Translation: &#8216;We were hoping the Republicans would bring up my blackness early so we could tar them as racists. Since they haven&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m going to accuse them of planning to exploit my blackness for their racist purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is preemptive race baiting. </p>

			<p>The GOP isn&rsquo;t racist, but it&rsquo;s out of touch.  They have had nearly eight years to try to set this country right, but have failed miserably.  Neoconservatism, like a cancer, has metastasized within the Republican Party, and is essentially threatening to kill the GOP for good.</p>
<p>Just what does the national Republican Party stand for, besides open borders, endless wars, and huge budget deficits?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a shame that it will be Barack Obama who primarily benefits from the incompetence and corruption of the GOP in 2008, but don&rsquo;t expect me to shed a tear.  The Republicans are getting exactly what they deserve.  The rank-and-file had the chance to elect Ron Paul, Duncan Hunter, or Tom Tancredo for president.  </p>
<p>Instead, they elected the embarrassing John McCain.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to stop coddling the Republican Party, people.</p>

			<p>Well, since he has been sitting in a racist church listening to a racist preacher for some twenty years, it is a strategy I would use if I were a Republican strategist. Harping on the fact that he is a racist would be a good strategy and true to boot.</p>

This is a sign of weakness on Obama&rsquo;s part. The first set of things he mentions as potential criticisms is pretty accurate  &mdash;   they are all things the Republicans can and should mention to criticize him.  But one thing they will <i>not</i> criticize him about is his race.  To suggest that they would is basically the same as saying they are racists without any evidence.</p>

			<p>Obama is the living embodiment of Political Correctness (Cultural Marxism).</p>
<p>A white candidate with his (lack of) credentials would currently be pummeled for his inexperience and far-left values much more so than BHO, but by being black we have no choice but to vote for him or we are racist (the enemy).</p>
<p>Such is the logic of a sick and twisted totalitarian system.</p>

			<p>  Apart from being black, his socialists policies scare me. Actually I don&rsquo;t think &#8220;racist&#8221; is an actual word. Racialist means someone who believes in their own race. I believe all people of any mental capability believes in their own race, well, maybe with the exception of white liberals and neo-cons. BHO scares me with his &#8220;Change&#8221; rhetoric because he really doesn&rsquo;t specify what sort of change except for some dangerous  soviet policies. Hitting the oil companies with wind-fall profit taxes will only get this tacked onto the price of a gallon of gasoline. Instead of $4.00-$5.00 per gallon, it will go to $7.00 per gallon. Food prices will jump to make up for shipping costs. This will be on top of expired tax cuts and a certain over the counter tax increase that all democrats are notorious for. As one whom is a great contributor here always says (namely John PM)  God help us all&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

			<p>This whole election feels like a Saturday Night Live skit, sort of surreal &amp; badly-written.  </p>
<p>BO seems very foreign to me: he was raised overseas in muslim countries because his parents couldn&rsquo;t get away from the US fast enough; their bigamous marriage ended quickly; his surviving mother doesn&rsquo;t campaign for him.  What&hellip; there&rsquo;s more?  What more do I need to hear?  </p>
<p>Anyway, if people in America are still afraid of blacks 40 years after civil rights, there might actually be a reason.</p>

			<p>Why even bother with this nonsense anymore? What so many are missing is that America truly deserves Barack Obama as President! He is the IDEAL of what an enormous portion of this country - and indeed the bulk of all official policy and message claim to stand for! America 2008 is NOT, NOT, NOT the same country most of us here grew up in by a long shot - there is no getting around that. An Opra-fied, post-MTV, Hip-hop adoring, &#8220;Diversity Is Our Strenght&#8221; America is ripe for an Obama Presidency. This is how sad it really is folks&hellip;and does anyone really think McCain is a better choice? There is no &#8220;lesser&#8221; between the evils any longer.  </p>

			<p>Some more items to add to the  &#8220;topics that Obama forbids you to talk about&#8221;,</p>
<p>His funny name, his middle name, his youth, his inexperience, his wife, his church, his preacher, his race, his ears.</p>
<p>As Michelle Obama said, &#8220;Barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Republicans don&rsquo;t need to play the race card to make people afraid. The nightly news from any large city in the US is sufficient to scare any civilized person.<br>
Do you think that Barack&rsquo;s cute little daughters are going to attend a public school in Washington if he gets elected? Not if he&rsquo;s smart thay won&rsquo;t. Sucessful Black people play the &#8220;race card&#8221; every day by where they choose to live and by where they send their kids to school.</p>

			<p>Southern Strategy, anyone?</p>
<p>This election will truly be an &#8220;us&#8221; (whites) against &#8220;them&#8221; (minorities). According to the US Census, whites are 67% of the general population (down from 93% pre-1965 Immigration Reform Act).</p>
<p>The minority bloc mainly wants a &#8220;non-white&#8221; president; they want to break &#8220;whitey&#8221; strangle hold on the presidency. As one black female caller on C-SPAN says: &#8220;It&rsquo;s OUR turn to have the stage.&#8221; Or Oprah&rsquo;s &#8220;our time has come.&#8221; </p>
<p>Are the superdelegates at the DNC really going to give the nod to a black candidate? The Dems could win hand-downs against an idiot like McCain with a white candidate, even Hillary. Of course race is a factor. Obviously, it&rsquo;s the supreme factor for black voters; why can&rsquo;t it be the same for white voters?</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t be wanting no black man as president.</p>
<p>Axe not what your country can do for you; axe what you can do for your country.<br>

<p>Yup. This &#8216;old stuff&rsquo; just divides us, as it did in 1789, 1865, and 1964. Trouble is, we whites have not learned the lessons that Lincoln, Jefferson, and de Toqueville taught us.</p>
<p>That &#8216;they are a completely different people, not fit for these shores.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now some upstart child of a bigamous union dares to lecture us about it, as though he could lead us&hellip;.</p>
<p>May God have mercy on this stiffnecked and adulterous generation.</p>

			<p>What a joke.  His success so far has been partly because he is black.  He reminds voters every step of the way, just like he is doing in this comment.  </p>
<p>Why does he think he is getting over 90% of the black vote?  Even black conservatives are voting for him.  He even supported his lunatic pastor by saying &#8220;he could no more disown Rev Wright than he could disown the black community.&#8221;  </p>

			<p>The real issue this election has nothing to do with Obama.  It has to do with who gets to choose the next supreme court justices who retire.  Basically, all the liberal jackasses on the court are close to dying of old age.  They can&rsquo;t last another 4 years and definitely couldn&rsquo;t stick it out another 8.</p>
<p>If Obama is allowed to get in by racial realists and conservative who want to &#8220;teach people a lesson&#8221;, he will quickly re-energize the court system as an anti-white tool of oppression.  Opportunity for reform will not come again in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>If McCain is elected, we might not agree with everything he attempts but, at very least, the courts will return to their original intended function.  Probably, on most issues of import, the high court will kick authority back to state and local governments.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important.  Because not every corner of the US is liberal hell hole (most of the US actually thinks like us), you will get to choose to live in an area where people do not allow much of the abuse taking place now.</p>
<p>Obama will not give you that right and anti-white liberalism (the REAL cancer) will spread all over the US, no matter what local people think of it.</p>

			<p>The Republicans might go after Obama&rsquo;s wife, but I&rsquo;m not conviced that they&rsquo;ll &#8220;use&#8221; race. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too dangerous. </p>
<p>America is a much different country and the Republicans are a much different party than they were in the days of Willie Horton.</p>
<p>Race is the Achilles heel of the new political order.</p>
<p>The last thing the establishment wants is a racially conscious white Republican base. </p>
<p>Which is what will likely happen if the Republicans use race to defeat Obama.</p>

<p>Who needs to do that?  I mean, isn&rsquo;t the fact that he was part of a congregation that were rabid white hating terrorists for 20 years enough to cause any white that isn&rsquo;t a gullible fool to refuse to vote for him, and his white-hating, despicable wife?</p>
<p>If the Republicans are smart, they&rsquo;ll simply use his own words and his associations with people who despise whites and want to see them dead to warn people what voting for this racist means.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a man that has close associations and friendships with some of the evilist black racists in the country whose daily existences involve repeated unjust condemnations of whites as standard operating procedure, and he has the nerve to speak of being a victim of racism?</p>
<p>Spare me, please.  Spare me.</p>

			<p>It all comes down to either John McCain has what it takes to stand up to a race baiter or he doesn&rsquo;t.  How many republicans now unhappy with McCain were &#8220;Obamacans&#8221; who didn&rsquo;t take the opportunity to support a republican they actually liked in the primaries?  McCain had already won by the time I got a chance to vote.</p>

			<p> Let&rsquo;s see. Hummmmmmm. The candidate of &#8220;hope and change&#8221;, of leaving the old style politics behind has established his game plan as the old politics on steroids. He descends to playing the race card first so as to point the finger at his opposition. This is contemptous of the public as it assumes the inability of the voters to examine evidence.<br>
 As far as Michelle is concerned, she has made herself an issue through her intemperate public remarks. She should be an issue based on recent history. Hillary Clinton was not elected to the presidency but was handed, or took, the job of attempting to socialize our healthcare system. Since Michelle is no shrinking violet, it is fair to ask what will she demand of her husband should he be elected.</p>

			<p>Obama loves using race as long as it works to his advantage.  If whites were as racially oriented politically as blacks and voted 90% + of the time in favor of the candidate that openly represented white interests then he would never have a chance of winning.  </p>
<p>The first effect of political correctness is that it keeps people from openly talking about race.  One casualty of this election is that whites might start speaking a little more openly about race and specifically black racism.  That will take an arrow out of the left&rsquo;s quiver.  Don&rsquo;t expect blacks to like that as it happens.  </p>
<p>Their precious Michelle Obama might end up being the test case for this.  If she were smarter like her husband she would have been more careful about what she has said, written, and done.    </p>

 It would be nice to be a fly on the wall in the recent Clinton/Obama meetings and see what quid pro quo&rsquo;s were agreed upon. It wouldn&rsquo;t be too surprising if Hillary were gauranteed the position of healthcare Czar, or perhaps Bill/Hillary on the Court.<br>

			<p>I am sure that the US Army&rsquo;s Equal Opportunity Program is hoping that Senator Obama becames the next president.  Why, The Army&rsquo;s EO Program teaches that the white race is the only race capable of practicing discrimination, being prejudice, and being racist.  In addition, the Army teaches Soldiers that minorities contributed more to American society than White-Americans.  In addition, all minoritiy deviant behavior is caused by white racism.  I have a website that the US Army does not want you to see: www.eodoublestandard.net.</p>

			<p>McCain does not look too good for a president. Obama looks better, they both are about the same with thier verbal inabilities.</p>
<p>What worries me is how long Bama&rsquo;s majik will last. This could be bad for whites, as Clinton inspired a lot of hate from the Republicans, even a plane crash into the white house attempt, and the AK-47 incident. So there may be other unstable people who attack him. He WILL use his race to batter his opponents, but that will only last so long.  His arrogant, cocky attitude may actually be excused, instead of ridiculed. His &#8216;otherness&rsquo; has been his greatest asset (along with Bush 2). He will use it to his advantage. The hippie generations eggs are comming home to roost, Obama is one of the most rotten. Times will be interesting.</p>

			<p>All of us AmReners need to re-read &ldquo;Posted by HH at 4:21 AM on June 21&rdquo; as many times as it takes until his words are etched onto our minds because he &ldquo;gets it&rdquo;. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on is the final stage of the struggle between Communism and Conservatism to see which will control America. Both major political parties are nothing more than vote-chasers, and the Republican Party has moved left, joining the Marxist Democrat Party on that side of the political spectrum in pursuit of leftist votes. </p>
<p>Things that have been happening in our nation were set in motion by the true rulers of America &mdash; who are our to-the-death enemy &mdash; for one purpose: to change the ratio of conservatives to leftists in this country by decreasing the conservatives. That&rsquo;s why they have been doing everything they can to increase the number of non-whites in America. What would be the effect on the Republican Party, do you imagine, if all of a sudden 70 to 80 percent of all the voters in the country were leftists? How loudly do you think they would shout out their conservative ideals? Look at it in reverse. How fast do you think the Democrat Party would run to the right if suddenly 80 percent of all voters became staunchly conservative? If we want back the America we once knew; if we want the America our Founding Fathers envisioned, we must increase conservatism; and, ideally, fully remove the leftists &mdash; of all colors &mdash; from our land.</p>
<p>Note: The one good thing that that Muslim&rsquo;s run for President has done is that it has finally enabled us to see the real truth about so-called black conservatives like J.C. Watts and Armstrong Williams. </p>
<p>And, yes, a Hussein Obama Presidency should be feared by all good, true Americans; but so should a Lefty McCain Presidency be feared by us. Only a leftist would vote for a leftist which is why I&rsquo;ll be voting for none of the above.</p>
<p>Thanks, HH. Good post.      <br>

So I&rsquo;m not so sure this election will be a whites versus minorities affair. Whites versus blacks, yes. But where Hispanics come down may be the deciding factor.</p>

<p>Not likely. McAmnesty and his liberal handlers would never allow it&hellip;.but if they did, and they should, then they&rsquo;d win.</p>
<p>In fact, I get the distinct impression McAmnesty is subtly, and deliberately sabotaging his own chances for winning. Why else does he consistently stick his thumb in the eye of his base [white conservatives]? Something has smelt awful during this whole election cycle. I think the fix is in!  <br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is a matter of race, but of character, if Colin Powell ran for President, I would have voted for him.  No matter what party he represented.  I vote on the person, not the party, but I am somewhat conservative.</p>
<p>One of the most important positions in our country is held by a black female, Condoleezza Rice, so don&rsquo;t tell me this country is prejudiced against blacks.  (or women&hellip;)</p>
<p>I am probably voting for McCain, because I feel Obama is a bad choice all the way around, and it has nothing to do with his &#8220;race&#8221; or &#8220;color&#8221;.  His association with extreme liberals is what makes me nervous, and his inexperience at handling world issues.  </p>

			<p>All I can think about is the pictures of the presidents arranged around the room near the top of the ceiling in grade schools across the country.  I don&rsquo;t know if they still do that, but I remember those faces from my school days.  The greats and the pretty goods:  Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, Truman, Jackson.  A long line of great, honorable white men.  Guys with flaws, but also with vision and courage and imagination.  And then, No. 44, a guy with a creepy, foreign name. Obama.  How can anyone think that it&rsquo;s a good idea to put someone that foreign, that odd, that out of step with the mainstream, on the same wall as Jefferson and Washington?  It&rsquo;s unimaginable and it&rsquo;s obscene, and I think it&rsquo;s a clear sign that this country is winding down. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, that part is true.  McCain is promising to be George W. Bush II, and George W. Bush I did everything possible to discredit the Republican party.  So my prediction is that Obama will win, not because he&rsquo;s a promising candidate, but because in this case the voters will pick the devil they don&rsquo;t know in preference to the devil they know all too well.<br>

<p>&#8220;Translation: &lsquo;We were hoping the Republicans would bring up my blackness early so we could tar them as racists. Since they haven&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m going to accuse them of planning to exploit my blackness for their racist purpose.&rsquo;<br>

<p>As usual, South Buffalo is spot on. No white outside of sites like this can use the race card. We will lose our jobs, become black listed and villified. Just ask Ms Ferraro. Only a black can use the race card and this apparently includes the candidate himself.</p>

			<p>I never believed this guy had a chance until I really had a chance to think about it.  I thought for sure that Hillary Clinton, with that same powerful force that propelled her husband into office in the 90&rsquo;s, was going to work for her too.  I was completely wrong.  I wasn&rsquo;t thinking clearly.  The same force that funded and excerabated every upheaval in this country (civil rights movement, riots, protests), is the same powerful force behind Obama and they have more than just flowers this time.  And it turns out, it&rsquo;s a much more powerful machine than the Clintons every had.  While, I truly believe that Clinton is a socialist deep in her heart and mind, Obama is much more dangerous.  It&rsquo;s the socialist believers who are funding him and they have A LOT of money now.  They&rsquo;ve been educated in the finest schools and obtained high paying, powerful jobs.  Every media outlet is owned and operated by some left-wing looney.</p>
<p>Call me paranoid all you want.  What has happened over the last 50 years to bring us to this point in our country&rsquo;s history was in the making in the 20&rsquo;s, 30&rsquo;, 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s.  Back then, people who were exposed as being members of the communist party, working secretly in our government - well they just wised up.  They may have changed their party name affiliation but they are still the same communists/socialists at heart, mind and body.  THEY ARE THE DEMOCRAT PARTY!!!!!  It&rsquo;s obviously not a stigma anymore to be labeled a socialist.  Isn&rsquo;t there a Democrat congressman in Vermont or New Hampshire who has actually admitted that he&rsquo;s a socialist.  And unfortunately, George Bush has done so much damage to the Republicans, that one can hardly tell the difference between the 2 parties.</p>
<p>I agreed with the poster above Sandy Banducci.  My boss, who was a Hillary supporter, accused me of not wanting to vote for her because she was a woman or because Obama was black.  I was insulted and told her so.  I wasn&rsquo;t voting for either of them because I wasn&rsquo;t going to vote for a communist.  It didn&rsquo;t matter what gender or color they were.  I didn&rsquo;t vote for Ronald Reagan because he was white,  I voted for him because I believed in what he did.</p>

			<p>Interesting, is it not, that whites tend to vote for the individual (depending on his qualifications) and blacks overwhelmingly vote for the person&rsquo;s race.  This has been demonstrated over and over again and I know of no exception.<br>
A black, or even a mulatto, who had any real concern with black welfare would do one thing, viz. he would concentrate all of his attention of changing the black attitude toward marriage  &mdash;  there is only one way for blacks to escape the permanent underclass and that is to begin following the white, middle class life script: growing up in a married two parent family which encourages the youth to study and achieve, completion of HS and college, and then marriage and after all of that, childbearing with heavy parental investment in the children.  This is the script that has allowed generations of whites and blacks to succeed in this society. </p>
<p> The black underclass has no script.  Girls have children while teenagers by multiple fathers and grow up making no investment in their own children relying on the state to support them and the cycle goes on without end.  This has been known for several decades(and was pointed out by Patrick Moynihan in his report on The Black Family in 1965) now and yet all that has come out of academia and the political elites, both black and white, are excuses for maintaining the underclass mentality.  The only possible conclusion is that the elites, white liberals and black &#8220;leaders&#8221;, want the underclass to continue and grow.  It gives them an excuse for spending more government money and creating more commissions and departments and of course blaming white society for the failure of black America, all things that tend to increase the size and power of the state and are very easy to do.  None of these things will help underclass blacks and one cannot avoid the conclusion that those in power are entirely cynical on this subject.  Open borders with a massive inflow of non-whites only helps to swell the size of this underclass.</p>
<p>Obama and his affirmative action wife have no interest in the welfare of blacks.  If they did, they would have never subscribed to the &#8220;religion&#8221; of excuses and anti-white racism of their church of 20 years.  All of the major figures in Obama&rsquo;s past are either anti-white racists or simply unreconstructed communists.  If there is one thing that should have made all the alarm bells go off, it is this fact.  Yet the MSM has said nothing of Obama&rsquo;s communist connections and only dealt with the issue of his church because it was impossible to ignore(because his pastor made it so).</p>
<p>What we can expect from an Obama presidency is a complete failure to acknowledge the true causes of the black underclass, more affirmative action and anti-white condemnations and the continued transformation, at a much more rapid rate, of the US into a communist paradise.  This is bad new for both blacks and whites and may well spark widespread inter-racial clashes.  The only good that can possibly come of this is an early start to CWII.  If Obama were smarter than he is, he would continue to appear &#8220;moderate&#8221; while promoting radical positions.  He will, however, likely be pressured by his more radical supporters to come out with his true agenda once elected.  As far as McCain goes one need answer only one question: how often has a presidential candidate said one thing while seeking office, only to turn around and do the exact opposite once in office?  McCain may be playing the game, supporting border control, gun rights, etc, now, but I would not expect him to do any of these things if he is elected.  His likely appointments to the supreme court will not be strict constructionists, as he claims.  They will be leftists just like him, only more radical.  If Obama appoints extreme leftists to the court, there is a chance that they will be challenged by the Republican opposition and in a sane world impeached.  This is less likely if McCain is elected (which is impossible since he does not even have the support of the Republican base).  My conclusion is that we will have an Obama presidency, at least for one term, and all of the evil that such an event portends.  So now is the time to buy that rifle or handgun you have been thinking about and to stock up on ammo, for under an Obama presidency the 2nd amendment will surely be utterly trashed and Obama is going to be president in November.</p>

			<p>People of African descent have, by far, the lowest intelligence of all humans according to multiple studies conducted over many decades by numerous experts in the fields of genetics, education, and human intelligence. The facts are based on empirical evidence and objective, anecdotal observations.</p>
<p>Intelligence governs one&rsquo;s ability to make decisions and act. Human behavior is derived from one&rsquo;s intelligence. The corresponding outcomes that result from behaviors are reflected in every metric in existence. The rates of crime, birth, illegitmacy, disease, promiscuity, infidelity, education, illiteracy, anti-socialism, welfare, dependancy, deferral of responsibility, and other undesirable behaviors that are incompatible with civilization manifest disproportionately in Blacks.</p>
<p>Those are the facts.</p>
<p>No amount of pretending, or affirmative action, or the selection of a smiling Black man, dressed up in a suit and tie by White people and chosen by minions in a popularity contest, will change the facts.</p>
<p>This election has taught me a sad, but valuable lesson about the gullibility and indifference of many Whites. It is difficult to believe that so many White people are so irresponsible and disregard their own race.</p>
<p>I stated in this forum last year when the current credit crisis arose and the dollar became increasing devalued that our nation was being reevaluate and revalued internationally.</p>
<p>The USA is ranked 12th in the world HDI rankings. The line &#8220;We&rsquo;re the greatest country on Earth&#8221; has always been a myth and that truth is more obvious now than ever.</p>
<p>The best countries on the list are the homogenous White countries, plus homogenous Japan. The worst countries are in Africa and elsewhere in the third world.</p>
<p>With the increasing dilution of the race of people who once made the USA a great nation, the country&rsquo;s HDI ranking is sure to fall much lower. </p>
<p>The nation is heading down the same road as Portugal and South Africa. There is no turning back. The USA is a tarnished, soiled nation heading toward becoming a third-world Balkanized state. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time now.</p>
<p>The nation is reaping what it has sown. </p>
<p>The only question now is where does one move to and live. Is a tiny, obscure town in the mountains of northern Montana the best option?</p>

			<p>Its very funny.  McCain has obviously tried to stifle every single GOP attempt to draw attention to his middle name or the fact that he is black.  He has condemned people for referring to Obama as &#8220;B.H.O.&#8221; and he has tried to stop the GOP from running ads that emphasize his &#8220;blackness&#8221; in South (or North) Carolina.</p>
<p>Members of AmRen might have known that there was little J.M. could have done to convince the Obama camp that he wasn&rsquo;t a &#8220;racist&#8221;, I just find it so funny that a people (the GOP) would spend so much effort in trying to convince people they WEREN&rsquo;T racist when everyone with half a brain knows you cannot do such a thing.</p>
<p>And the last humerous thing I find in Obamas claim - despite all of McCains efforts Obama is still basically saying &#8220;The Evil White GOP is going to play the race card.&#8221;  The basic point of Obamas racism claim is that whites are racist, its a racist statement.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why the GOP is in love with Hispanics.</p>

<p>This 50% white person (Obama) understands the reality, that will never change:  America was settled, founded, created, etc. etc., by and for whites.  Read some pre-PC-era history books.

<p>He said he was also set for Republicans to say &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got a feisty wife,&rdquo; in trying to attack his wife Michelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know the strategy because they&rsquo;ve already shown their cards. Ultimately I think the American people recognize that old stuff hasn&rsquo;t moved us forward. That old stuff just divides us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to the Republicans saying this, they should also say loudly and clearly that this guy is an extreme liberal, belonged to a racist anti-white church for 20 years, and is already using the race card to try to further his advantage, despite the fact that he&rsquo;s half white. They could expose this guy for what he is, a hypocrite, a clear racist, and will be one of the biggest dividers this nation can have as a president.       <br>
He no more deserves to be in the white house than a first year high school student does. It&rsquo;s just unbelievable he&rsquo;s gotten this far. <br>
When will white people wake up? I don&rsquo;t think they ever will until it&rsquo;s too late. God help us all.   </p>

			<p>If the truth could be told, racial facts would and should stoke fear into people. But as we know the facts cannot be publicly stated because it hurts the feelings of people who would rather live a life of lies.</p>

			<p>Condoleezza Rice is a classic example of the incompetence of black leadership in America: 9/11 happened on her shift as &#8220;National Security Advisor&#8221; and she continues to deny any responsibility.  She was in no way qualified for the job she was handed by the &ldquo;panderer in chief&rdquo;, anymore than Obama is qualified for the job of President&hellip;</p>

			<p>Obama is a diabolical liar. He cannot fail to know that it was the Democrats who played the race card, Clinton, Sharpton, Jackson all chimed in. A teensy part of me wants America and the world to experience the horrors of an Obama Marxist presidency, just to watch them squirm, but I fear the damage he could do. McCain, to his credit, has studiously avoided any of the Democrat&rsquo;s  baiting tactics, so we are witnessing a desperate Obama trying to force the issue.</p>
<p><i>So now is the time to buy that rifle or handgun you have been thinking about and to stock up on ammo, for under an Obama presidency the 2nd amendment will surely be utterly trashed and Obama is going to be president in November.<i><br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t watch much TV but I was watching the nightly news yesterday and was astonished by the pro Obama pieces they ran with.  One segment talked about how race is a huge issue that Obama has to trancend to get elected. Essentially it was a piece that had the intention of guilting white people into voting for Obama, otherwise to not do so would mean they&rsquo;re racist.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m astonished just like everyone else.  I can&rsquo;t believe that a guy with just 2 years experience in the Senate and no major acheivements who&rsquo;s tied to Black Liberation Theology is poised to become POTUS.  You&rsquo;d think that since we&rsquo;re at war with radical muslims that Obama&rsquo;s name would surely prevent any chance of him winning much less the nomination.  </p>
<p>I think though this election will change a lot of people&rsquo;s views and probably bring more people to our cause of self-preservation.  Already I can see that many people&rsquo;s views are evolving to where I&rsquo;ve arrived. </p>
<p>The bottom line is, we have to make our cause for self-preservation mainstream so you must talk to people and make your voice known on the Internet and elsewhere.  Aside from prayer you have no other vehicle for change.</p>

			<p>If you thinks he&rsquo;s playing the race card now, wait until he gets into office. Don&rsquo;t go along with Obama it&rsquo;s only because you don&rsquo;t like &#8220;strong, powerful black males&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Obama seems to be getting in two or three jabs for every flaccid counterpunch by McCain.  McCain is in a Thunderdome cage match, but he doesn&rsquo;t know it, and this country is going to be undermined and hollowed out as a result.  I think our enemies will view a &#8220;nice guy&#8221; Obama administration as a signal to militarily attack us.  This country is in serious trouble, and I predict that we are going to face a &#8216;perfect storm&rsquo; of disasters.</p>

 Would that this were the case. but I suspect otherwise.</p>
<p> McCain may be the political version of the Harlem Globetrotters&rsquo;<br>
opponent, the Washington Generals: a white designated loser<br>
who makes no attempt to win.</p>

			<p>The caption of this article eloquently suggests Obama is already playing the race card&hellip; far in advance of the election. Telling us in effect, &#8220;vote against me and you&rsquo;re a racist!&#8221;</p>
<p>What Obama can&rsquo;t admit is we SHOULD be afraid of him. He IS Black. He IS young. He IS inexperienced. Have we forgotten the lessons of the Carter Administration thirty-some years earlier? Carter used his family&rsquo;s wealth to buy his way into the White House. His ineptness and inexperience quickly turning him into a well-intentioned bungler and utter buffoon. The backlash of four years of Carter&rsquo;s well-meant bungling swept the Dems out of the White House for the next 12 years! I am surprised at the utter stupidity of the Democrats in even considering Obama as their &#8216;champion.&rsquo; Even Lying Hillary had a whole lot more to recommend her, distasteful though Shrillary Clinton might be to many of us.</p>
<p>It will be an interesting election season, and unless a lot of American voters have completely lost their reasoning ability, their minds, Obama will emphatically NOT realize his ambition of becoming the first Black American President. (Besides, Bill Clinton stole that honor from Obama sixteen years earlier.) Which in itself is good for a chuckle, considering how Blacks turned against Shrillary Clinton in droves, even though Bill was such an ardent champion of Blacks during his eight years. That Blacks turned traitor to Clinton&rsquo;s wife also should get many people thinking&hellip; about Obama readily turning his back to White Americans within days, should the unthinkable happen and Obama does get elected.</p>

			<p>For all the great American contributions, I must say the last 10 years has displayed a conspicious absence of political leadership. What the hell has gone wrong? The USA has become an embarrassment. The George W. legacy has been a comedy of errors, and all the mighty USA can offer is McCain and Obama. God help us all. </p>

			<p>Gayle Sollenberger, I enjoyed your post. The idea or suspicion that the Democratic Party is really the Communist party goes back to FDR. There were many oldtimers who swore that they had witnessed the communist song &#8220;The International&#8221; being played and song at some of the gatherings of Elinore Roosevelt. Certainly todays Democratic Party being communist in nature takes no stretch of the imagination when one observes their activiities for the last 40 plus years. To me the main question is, as you hint at, has the Republican Party been co-opted by the Democratic Communists? </p>

<p>ablackman, </p>
<p>According to your peoples&rsquo; logic (which would be comical in-and-of-itself if it weren&rsquo;t so dangerously unpredictable), whites are &#8220;misguided and have closed minds&#8221; because we are able to discriminate between reality and inverted-reality &hellip; and the reality is: B.Hussien and his angry wife are Racial Marxists.     </p>
