<h1><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1026097/England-squeeze-10million-quarter-century.html">Time to Budge Up</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty, MailOnline, June 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>England will have to make room for 10million extra people in less than 25 years&rsquo; time, official figures predicted yesterday.</p>
<p>The population is expected to top 60million by 2030 &mdash; as many as live in the whole of the UK now.</p>
<p>The rise is equivalent to a city the size of London, or the populations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland put together.</p>
<p>Most of the new residents will be immigrants, who are already adding 191,000 a year to the population, according to current Government figures.</p>
<p>Their children are also likely to form a large part of the surge, as birthrates among newly-arrived groups are higher than among the existing population.</p>
<p>The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, brought further warnings from critics of large-scale immigration. </p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green of the Migrationwatch think- tank said: &lsquo;Some 70 per cent of this population increase will be a result of immigration. This is clearly unsustainable from the point of view of public services and infrastructure, and, even more importantly, from the point of view of the cohesion of society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The projections are based on population and immigration estimates from 2006, which put the number of people living in England that year at 50,763,000.</p>
<p>The ONS says that figure is likely to pass the 55million mark in 2017, and by 2031 England will be home to 60,432,000.</p>
<p>The biggest rises in that period are expected to be in the South-East (nearly 1.6million more residents), the East (gaining 1.4million) and the capital (1.3million more Londoners).</p>
<p>Other regions will be less popular with immigrants and less subject to population pressures, the figures say. The North-East is expected to take little more than 200,000 extra people.</p>
<p>The statistics are the latest to suggest that Whitehall expects recent very high population increases to continue in the coming decades.</p>
<p>Last month, ONS figures said the population has risen by a million in just three years &mdash; a faster rate than when today&rsquo;s big cities took shape at the height of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Some Government-sponsored projections put the UK population as high as 100million by the end of this century.</p>
<p>The new arrivals will add to a growing housing crisis, with the Government struggling to meet existing demand for homes.</p>
<p>Its latest proposals to build a series of &lsquo;eco- towns&rsquo; have already provoked protests from MPs and those alarmed that massive estates are going to spring up on their doorsteps.</p>
<p>The Department for Communities and Local Government says that a third of the number of new homes that need to be built are needed to house immigrants.</p>
<p>When this estimate is updated shortly, it is expected to say that at least 38 per cent of new homes will be built for immigrants.<br>

			<p>England was a beautiful and still quaint clearly British nation when I was last there in 1988.  I fear to go there now.  Even if I didn&rsquo;t have a mishap, I am afraid that it would be too depressing to see it now.</p>

<p><br>
Why?  Do they need these people as workers?  The article refers to them as &#8220;extra&#8221; people.</p>
<p>This is a serious question.  Why?  Because of feel-good policies?</p>

			<p>There are already 59 million people in England,so who is playing silly buggers with the numbers,do they think that we will not notice these blatant lies from the labour-fascists?they are removing 10 million from our present numbers in order to pretend that there is plenty of room for another ten million third world parasites.</p>

			<p>The stupid labour government can&rsquo;t deal with the numbers coming in so they massage the figures! The English cities of Bradford and Blackburn has been colonized by Pakistanis, parts of London now resemble Jamaica or Nigeria and Leicester is an Indian city! Labour tell us there are only 1.6 million muslims in the UK when the true figure is closer to FOUR MILLION! </p>

			<p>Room will be made quite easily with decent hard working Britons emigrating out of this overcrowded hell hole to places like Australia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle, we get people coming in who will for the most part just sit on welfare and exploit the system, while the ones who paid for those benefits through taxes (too many taxes i might add) are leaving in droves.</p>
<p>This can only go on so long until Britain finally becomes a third world cesspit and all the people rushing here now for a cushy life, will themselves start rushing to places like Australia, starting the cycle all over again.</p>
<p>How can such a great nation have fallen so far in only 50 years, our ancestors must be spinning in their graves at the destruction of the Great Britain which they left to us.</p>

<p> It all started sixty years ago with the Labour party and the Empire Windrush that they so welcomed into Britain. Also ironically, Winston Churchill, so wrongly revered by so many Britons, bares a heavy share of the responsibility. See Patrick Buchanan&rsquo;s latest book for more on this.</p>

			<p>Cross of St. George writes of English people emigrating &#8220;to places like Australia&#8221;. Well, unhappily Australia isn&rsquo;t what it was - its non-white population is larger, proportionately, than that of the U.K. So if they&rsquo;re emigrating to get away from our coloured friends (how old fashioned is that - am I allowed to say &#8220;coloured&#8221;?) they are going to be sorely disappointed. And with  Krudd&rsquo;s new Labour government promising 300,000 immigrants per annum things are going to get very much worse very quickly.  </p>
<p>So in all white English speaking countries, even in the mother country herself,  our people -  the founding population - becomes a mere diaspora with no land to call its own. Or does it? Political will, political activism, social and cultural re-birth may yet work wonders, very late though the hour may be, and most of our countries have groups that are working night and day to that end - find them, join them and start to turn the tide! </p>

<p> True. I would add that in both cases Britain CHOSE to declare war. Britain was the architect of its own disasters. There was nothing in the 1839 treaty of Ghent that demanded Britain declare war on any country that violated Belgium&rsquo;s national territory. Britain used it as a pretext to &#8216;honor&rsquo; its secret treaty with France (about which the British people knew nothing) to crush a commercial, industrial and trade rival, Wilhelmine Germany. Likewise the pledge to Poland was nothing more then a foolish bluff that couldn&rsquo;t possibly be enforced. It also turned Hitler&rsquo;s eastward expansionary drive for &#8216;lebensraum&rsquo; westward, a catastrophic geopolitical error. Britain was most ill-served in the 20th century by a series of remarkably stupid &#8216;statesmen&rsquo;.</p>
