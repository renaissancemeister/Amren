			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Allen, Telegraph (London), June 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Metropolitan Police is facing its most damaging race row since the fall out from the murder of Stephen Lawrence as black police associations line up behind the UK&rsquo;s most senior Muslim officer.</p>
<p>Colleagues who have seen Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur&rsquo;s case for racial discrimination against the force described it as &#8220;astonishing&#8221;.</p>
<p>They said evidence of bullying, discrimination and victimisation against Mr Ghaffur was compelling.</p>
<p>The National Black Police Association said the officer, who has been responsible for Olympic security preparations, had been treated &#8220;extremely poorly&#8221;.</p>
<p>It called on Home Secretary Jacqui Smith to intervene in a row that threatens to plunge the force into its biggest crisis since the murder of Stephen Lawrence, which led to the Met being branded &#8220;institutionally racist&#8221; in the 1999 Macpherson inquiry.</p>
<p>Mr Ghaffur is currently deciding whether to formally submit his dossier of evidence to an employment tribunal.</p>
<p>But senior members of the NBPA, who have have seen the documents, said they were &#8220;totally and utterly convinced&#8221; that he has a legitimate claim.</p>
<p>Among the documents are believed to be allegations of victimisation by Commissioner Sir Ian Blair and Metropolitan Police Authority chair Len Duvall.</p>
<p>Both Sir Ian and Mr Duvall have publicly denied that they behaved inappropriately in any way.</p>
<p>An NBPA spokesman said: &#8220;Having reviewed the evidence we are astonished at the amount of material which was presented to us in support of his case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Assistant Commissioner Ghaffur appears to have been treated extremely poorly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are totally and utterly convinced of the legitimacy of this claim and will be fully supporting Mr Ghaffur.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are calling for an immediate intervention at a senior governmental level to prevent this dispute escalating.&#8221;</p>
<p>London Metropolitan Police Commander Ali Dizaei said he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; when he learned details of the allegations made by Mr Ghaffur.</p>
<p>Mr Dizaei said: &#8220;He is a very loyal, a very loyal person and extremely competent. For a person of his personality and character, to embark on this course of action, I think he is at the end of his tether. Some of the evidence was unequivocal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Relations between Mr Ghaffur and Sir Ian were said to have broken down to such an extent that they would only speak at formal meetings.</p>
<p>However, Sir Ian said that was &#8220;nonsense&#8221; and praised Mr Ghaffur as a role model.</p>
<p>Sir Ian said he would deal &#8220;robustly and quickly&#8221; with anyone in the Met who did not work to his direction.</p>
<p>He does not have the power to sack Mr Ghaffur but could refer the matter to the Police Authority for further investigation.</p>
<p>Asked if it was unfair for Sir Ian to be accused of racism, London Mayor Boris Johnson said : &#8220;I am sure that is unfair yes, but I do not want to get into the details of the case.&#8221;<br>
