						<p>Conversations about race are fraught with emotion, confusion and controversy. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should avoid or sidestep the issue.</p>
<p>As a Latino raised in East Los Angeles, and as the elected sheriff of Los Angeles County for the last decade, I have seen many sides of the race issue. I have lived it, in fact.</p>
<p>So let me be very clear about one thing: We have a serious interracial violence problem in this county involving blacks and Latinos.</p>
<p>Some people deny it. They say that race is not a factor in L.A.&rsquo;s gang crisis; the problem, they say, is not one of blacks versus Latinos and Latinos versus blacks but merely one of gang members killing other gang members (and yes, they acknowledge, sometimes the gangs are race-based).</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re wrong. The truth is that, in many cases, race is at the heart of the problem. Latino gang members shoot blacks not because they&rsquo;re members of a rival gang but because of their skin color. Likewise, black gang members shoot Latinos because they are brown.</p>
<p>Just look at the facts. In February 2006, our jail system erupted into a full-scale riot involving about 2,000 black and Latino inmates at the North County Correctional Facility at Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic. One black inmate died and numerous others were injured. Through extensive interviews with participants, our investigation revealed that race &mdash; not gang affiliation &mdash; was the motivating factor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have evidence linking inmates who are known as &ldquo;shot callers&rdquo; directly to street shootings based entirely on race. These shot callers at Pitchess and elsewhere are affiliated with gangs, to be sure, and in many cases they may give the order to kill a particular person or a member of a particular gang. But if that person or gang cannot be found, the shot caller will often order the gunman to find someone &mdash; anyone &mdash; who is black or brown and shoot them instead. Gang affiliation does not matter. Only the color of the victim&rsquo;s skin matters.</p>
<p>I would even take this a step further and suggest that some of L.A.&rsquo;s so-called gangs are really no more than loose-knit bands of blacks or Latinos roaming the streets looking for people of the other color to shoot. Our gang investigators have learned this through interviews in Compton and elsewhere throughout the county. L.A.&rsquo;s gang wars have long been complicated by drugs, territory issues or money. Now, it can also be over color.</p>

			<p>Let me see if I have this straight.  When blacks and browns kill each other, race can be mentioned as a factor.  When a White kills a black or brown, race can be mentioned as a factor.  But when blacks and browns kill Whites&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; </p>

			<p>Sheriff Baca, being hispanic and often pressured by the RAZA groups, is a model for other Sheriffs. I don&rsquo;t care what anyone says, he is a real MAN OF INTEGRITY, I&rsquo;ve listened to him on the issues the County Sheriff deals with for years. Los Angeles County is huge, and I will say this right now, I would rather have Chief Baca anyday, than the usual pathetic, white beurocrat.</p>

			<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we really do live in an insane place.  Even when the (black and mexican) criminals ADMIT that they are racially motivated, nobody wants to believe.  I give Sheriff Vaca credit for having the guts to admit the obvious.  Then again, he is not a white man, so he has the &#8220;right&#8221; to do this.   </p>

			<p>It is refreshing to hear a sheriff speak the truth about race rather then blame the violence on other things.  The hatred between blacks and browns has greatly intensified with the browns, mostly illegal, moving into traditional black neighborshoods replacing blacks.  The city of Compton is a classic example, this formerly black city now is almost 90% brown.<br>
Most Los Angeles high schools are now populated by the children of illegal aliens and many areas of Los Angeles could pass for Mexican cities. Another factor is the violent gangs from south of our border.  MS-13 and other latin gangs seem to be protected by LAPD&rsquo;s Special Order 40 preventing officers from inquiring into the gang members immigration status.  The bottom line is that La Raza and other Hispanic groups are having great successful in their Reconquita goal and L.A is probably the first victim city.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The perception that one group has more opportunities and advantages than another can lead to resentment, competition and, ultimately, spontaneous eruptions of violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perceiving that one group has more advantages and opportunities over the other certainly are divisive factors, but those reasons are but a few that are causing resentment.  This sheriff made an excellent partial explanation of the problem and is instituting programs that will help a little bit for a short period of time, but he&rsquo;s overlooking the fact that Latinos and blacks dislike the way each other dress, act, their music, customs, culture, etc., all of which have driven a wedge between them that might ease from time to time, but never will the problem be solved until they can separate the two factions permanently. </p>
<p>Too, one of the main problems in getting along is the unequivocal fact that blacks fight with everybody, not just whites and mestizos, and it&rsquo;s just not possible to create any kind of lasting peace between them and any other group in the country, because of their propensity for troublemaking, which has proven to be unsurmountable so far.  Most racial groups will avoid giving blacks reasons to create uncontrolled havoc usually by shrinking back against bad behavior directed at them for the sake of tranquility, but mestizos refuse to give ground in order to go along to get along. So the resulting situation amounts to fights, riots and, sometimes, murders.  </p>
<p>This sheriff admits more truthfully to the problem than any white fop would dare do, but he&rsquo;s not going to create peace between these groups unless he recognizes that the only peace achievable is one which is brought about by separation, because multiculturalism/multiracialism has always failed and will do so every time it is tried.  </p>
<p>Much is done constantly by the multicults here to put a happy face on the racial situation, because I&rsquo;m pretty sure they believe if we all just pretend everything is o.k., and we keep whites intimidated, since they believe whites are the only racial group that needs intimidating, because they&rsquo;re the only ones who are prone to racism, then everything will fall into place.  </p>
<p>But, as usual, they&rsquo;re wrong.  They&rsquo;re too naive, really, to be involved in any kind of social experimentation, and like all the other ideologues throughout history their naivete and inability to read a situation correctly is going to cause untold strife and suffering.  The racial problems in L.A. are only just beginning, and we will see the same problems arise throughout the rest of the country where there are races living in close proximity to each other but, most especially, blacks. </p>
<p>What kind of idiotic society do we have where constant supervision and programs need to be continuously enforced in order to keep people from fighting and killing each other?  The answer, of course, is a multicultural/multiracial one.</p>
<p>And the ones responsible for all the chaos have the gall to claim that &#8220;diversity is our strength.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s hilarious really, if it weren&rsquo;t so deadly and tragic.</p>

			<p>During World War Two, the Mexicans there were beating up sailors, just because they were white.</p>
<p>When I was lost on a borrowed bicycle on my way home from a party in downtown Nanjing, China one night in 1987, I never felt unsafe, despite being an obvious stranger.  In Japan while on loan to a chemical company there, I was out at night all the time, and never felt unsafe.  When my wife&rsquo;s care was out of commission last year and I had to walk to the grocery store, I was stared at and followed by four young blacks.  I felt unsafe. </p>
<p>What we are seeing in Los Angeles is the normal breakdown of society when integration is forced upon people who do not want it.  This is why we used to have national borders.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Skin color&#8221; Surely you jest, man! Only a child identifies another individual unlike them by something as superficial as skin tone. These criminals/thugs know enough to understand the basics of human behavior, etc., and even the gang-bangers are more honest and realistic about just what race is and means than most of the population! </p>

			<p>I resent that &lsquo;as a latino&rsquo;, he believes his experience with race carries more weight than does mine.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is his experience with race DOES, in fact, carry more weight.  It carries more weight because, by and large, hispanics are not afraid to tell the truth about this issue&hellip;.blacks are evil and not to be tolerated.  Whites do not say this out of fear.</p>
<p>There is a word for that&hellip;.cowardice.</p>
<p>Because we tolerate cowardice.  Because liberals speaking for us in the way they do, is not confronted vigorously.</p>
<p>Why should other races listen to us, when race traitors can do as they please without consequences.  When the harm they do to us isn&rsquo;t just tolerated, it&rsquo;s celebrated.</p>
<p>That is SHAMEFUL behavior.  And it&rsquo;s a recent development.</p>
<p>The race traitors have always been around.  But prior to world war one, they hid themselves in terror for their lives (and they had good reason to).  That situation has slowly, but inexorably, given way to tolerance.  As with all forms of heinous evil, with tolerance comes domination.  The race traitors dominate us.  They speak for us.  And only a handful of people have a problem with that.</p>
<p>Man, even the premise of this article on Amren is sick and wrong.  What whites SHOULD be asking themselves is not why are the mexicans doing this to the blacks&hellip;.but aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>If you google Paul Sheehan&rsquo;s article on Race War, he quotes a statistic of 25 million white victims in the last 30 years.  Whites cannot even be bothered to notice, much less say anything about it.  Much less DO anything about it.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, why should you resent this latino being honest that his say carries more weight?  Don&rsquo;t resent him.  His race EARNED the right.</p>
<p>Instead, place your resentment where it should be.  On those pathetic, disgusting whites, that watch their kin being raped, robbed, murdered and beaten, smile sheepishly&hellip;then vote for Obama. </p>

			<p>I looked at the original article to see how it ended. No one in public politics is going to write an article pointing out a serious problem, and just leave it at that. There had to be a recommendation.</p>
<p>His recommendation is &#8220;a disarming of the gang culture&#8221; through programs that bring members of rival gangs together.</p>
<p>What would the cost of this be? Are citizens of Los Angeles Country supposed to pay individuals to sit down with members of different races so that they won&rsquo;t hate them as much? Is the government going to change inner attitudes and behavior patterns of thousands and thousands of people by dealing with them one at a time?</p>

			<p>I have found that Hispanics are usually open about hating Blacks, and will give you reasons why. Namely, hating their culture, or the fact that blacks often victimized them when their numbers were smaller in this country. But Blacks usually do what they always do, blame whitey,</p>

			<p>Most hispanics I interact with are mucho more civilized, family oriented and religious. The standard model black hood rat is an indolent violent drug using trouble maker. He has met his match dealing with quick tempered hispanics fleeing lawless third world south of the border pest holes that loosely resemble countries. Diversity, or its real name Marxism, is crumbling as predicted. <br>
It has never worked and never will.Trying to drill this into the heads of closed minded Communists,their fellow travelers,dupes and acolytes is a Herculean task.  &#8220;Diversity is our greatest strength&#8221; is like saying &#8220;Poison is our favorite drink.&#8221;</p>

			<p>You can compare Sheriff Baca&rsquo;s candidness with the mealy-mouthed and very PC commentary of LAPD Chief Bratton (who is white, and the successor to two black chiefs who were favored sons of their community but were ineffective), who has consistently downplayed and denied any racial element to local gang violence.  Bratton got taken to task several months ago by black journalists for this denial of plain reality.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s strange how now that Whitey has largely disappeared from Los Angeles (vanished in the proverbial &#8216;puff of smoke&rsquo;)that a REAL racial conflict has developed - a &#8216;Balkan&rsquo; style vendetta race war that threatens to be terrible in its consequences.</p>

			<p>Good for him. Baca made sure to mention that blacks were beating up Mexicans based on race. If this was a whitey, he would have just focused on white-on-black violence and ignored much greater racist violence committed by blacks.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s clear that Chief Bratton is doing the bidding and taking his orders from Reconquista Mayor Villaraigosa. The mayor has been a believer in the reconquista movement since his college days.  After being elected mayor he told a Mexican paper that Mexico would play an important role in his policies, and he indicated that he would not try to prevent illegal immigration in any way.<br>
He has been trying for years to gain control of the Los Angeles  education system to further his goals.  Villaraigosa works with similar minded people in the state legislature, including Reconquista Fabian Nunez, born in  Tijuana and state&rsquo;s<br>
Assembly speaker for several years. <br>
California seems to be in a &#8220;boiled frog&#8221; situation. <br>
The boiling frog story states that a frog can be boiled alive if the water is heated slowly enough  &mdash;  it is said that if a frog is placed in boiling water, it will jump out, but if it is placed in cold water that is slowly heated, it will never jump out.<br>
Don&rsquo;t be surprised if California has a name change to Mexifornia! </p>

			<p>Born and raised in Los Angeles and you have no idea how this area changed from farms, orchards, fields, safe and prosperous cities/towns/suburbs with American values, solid families, good employment, excellence in the public schools, and all American nice safe whitebread communities that produced smart dedicated Americans that ended a Cold War. </p>
<p>I remember when Compton was a safe whitebread suburban community with nicely manicured lawns where children played on the street in absolute safety. Almost every city in southern california was like that. Can you guess what they are like today? </p>
<p>Answer: exactly the opposite. Compton lives up to the reputation of most dangerous inner city/inner suburban areas across the United States due to its high level of poverty and very high violent crime rate, especially for murders, found in the city. This is typical now, to one degree or another, for most of the cities in LA County today and much of Southern California and also much of central and northern California has gone that way as well. Sometimes the tens upon tens of millions of non-white immigrants just go buck wild and riot all over the place. Each time this happens the minority white population (used to be a majority just one generation ago) has to take cover as a greenlight is immediately placed on us and we are actually hunted by hordes of gangmembers. Only when order is restored can we actually come out of our houses and apartments to resume &#8220;normal&#8221; living. It&rsquo;s really gone to hell here folks. </p>
<p>On a historical note, found an article dealing with much of the La Raza political falsehoods we hear today. Google: Mexicans Deserve Our Country More Than We Do?</p>
<p>Learn why they do not. </p>

			<p>Of course High Sheriff Baca stated the obvious! But what to do?<br>
Ah yes, a clear call to a program of affirmative action. What is needed here is to thoroughly integrate all the neighborhoods of Los Angeles with an equal number of Latinos, African - Americans, Asians, Indians, and Whites. And by this I mean complete diversity!</p>
<p>If diversity is good, desirable, and advantageous, then the MORE diverse we are the better, right? So, in the multi million dollar areas of Beverly Hills we must immediately integrate with the appropriate African-American and  Latino anti - social youth groups (which some conservatives refer to as &#8220;gangs&#8221;) Surely, everyone would benefit from the association. The youth groups could locate additional targets, excuse me, avenues for expression, and the local residents could get an up close and personal perspective on the benefits of diversity (which they have so long supported)!     </p>
<p>Certainly Senator Obama would support this approach since he regularly attended a church known for its diverse congregation and a preacher for his political sensitivity! I&rsquo;m sure that when elected, President Obama will make it a priority to throughly integrate the lily white areas of Georgetown (where all liberal, politically correct, talking heads seem to reside with impunity) with residents constituting the majority race of Washington D.C. After all, political correctness starts at home doesn&rsquo;t it? A good beginning, for President Obama once he takes office, will be to immediately start turning the neighborhoods of our Supreme Court Justices into ghettos!</p>
<p>No matter how often I tell my cat that squirrels are not mice he still chases squirrels. Furthermore, I would doubt that if one were to place my cat, in a cadge full of squirrels that they would all magically &#8220;get along&#8221; Instead, when I admonish my cat &#8220;Coco&#8221; for his lamentable lack of sensitivity he looks at me as if to say: &#8220;you are living proof that even an idiot can somehow manage to receive a college degree&#8221;! </p>
<p>Its easy to tell cats (and other people) how to live when you have enough money to insure that you don&rsquo;t have to live that way yourself!</p>

<p>Actually yes.  La County taxpayers are currently paying about half a billion dollars a year to some sort of &#8220;make the gangsters love each other&#8221; group led by a black female lawyer named Connie Rice.  Most of the people working on it are the same old black rabble rousers we have seem for 30 years, with the addition of white marxist feminazi sociology profs.</p>
<p>I can just imagine what the virile, macho young gangster think of this collection of middle aged marxist females.  I&rsquo;d like to be a fly on the wall and hear what the hispanic gangsters say about all the black female attorneys and &#8220;experts&#8221; involved.</p>
<p>As Maichavelli said. &#8220;You can&rsquo;t make anyone love you, but you can easily make them fear you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heard what the Italian government is doing?  In preparation for the usual summer season  tourists being robbed, raped and assaulted by african and arab illegal immigrants, they are putting several thousand armed soldiers on the city streets.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The boiling frog story states that a frog can be boiled alive if the water is heated slowly enough  &mdash;  it is said that if a frog is placed in boiling water, it will jump out, but if it is placed in cold water that is slowly heated, it will never jump out.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I would even&hellip;suggest that some of L.A.&rsquo;s so-called gangs are really no more than loose-knit bands of blacks or Latinos roaming the streets looking for people of the other color to shoot.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Those of you who are heaping praise on the sheriff should read the entire article.  After accurately stating the role of race in these crimes   &mdash;   and yes, he deserves credit there   &mdash;   he goes on to suggest the usual litany of liberal panaceas: increasing social services for marginalized minorities, increased integration, and a totally naive &#8220;let&rsquo;s hold hands and all be friends&#8221; attitude.  The subtext of the article is that the whole brown versus black war is just a consequence of the larger so-called problem of lack of adequate government services.  And we all know whose fault that is, don&rsquo;t we??</p>

Gary mentions &ldquo;Snake Plisskin,&rdquo;the character from the movie <i>Escape From New York.</i> </p>
<p>There were a number of &#8220;future apocalypse&#8221; movies like that made in the 1970&rsquo;s. It makes you wonder if people knew, subconsciously, that changes in society back then were moving everything in the direction of decay and total breakdown. </p>
<p>Nowadays, a movie like that might be too close to reality for people to find it entertaining.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I remember when Compton was a safe whitebread suburban community with nicely manicured lawns where children played on the street in absolute safety. Almost every city in southern california was like that. Can you guess what they are like today? &#8220;</p>
<p>    -The thing that frustrates me so much about this fact is that if you try to tell younger people how great it was to live in California back then, they will just give you a blank stare. They have never known a standard of living that was once the norm. They think THIS is the norm!</p>
<p>   How could we pass these conditions on to a next generation? They&rsquo;ll never even know what they were cheated out of. How sad, how totally insane and frightening that things have slipped to how they are now from the way they were.</p>

			<p>and yet, there is a solution; one which has already been tried with great success  &mdash;  it is known as the old official policy of segregation as practiced in the South from the end of Reconstruction until the modern &#8220;civil rights movement&#8221;. During that period, blacks did not prey upon whites in any way comparable to the current situation.  The same can be said of the relatively few hispanics that lived here at the time. There was no such thing as &#8220;the black vote&#8221; in those days and blacks themselves were much better off then  &mdash;   I am convinced that such is the only solution and if it cannot be reinstated, there will be no end to the current wave of black violence against every other race in the country.</p>

			<p>*Anchor Baby Faby* (Fabian Nunez) was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez" rel="nofollow">San Diego</a> to illegal alien parents in 1977. He spent most of his first nine years in Tijuana, but he was not born there. His parents got legalized in Reagan&rsquo;s shamnesty in 1986. He was always legal, being an anchor baby.</p>
<p>As a Californian, I must tell you that these anchor babies and even the kids of legal Mesoamerican immigrants are the biggest disaster around. I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree that illegals are a nightmare (I live in an area swarming with illegals and I have met many who are fine people) but their kids are almost always a total nightmare. The rule of thumb in California is that the Hispanic gangs are made up of the children of the illegals, not so much the illegals themselves. At least in these parts. Around here, the illegals mostly work. It&rsquo;s native born Americans who are out of work, since it seems like most of the jobs go to illegals around here.</p>

<p>Take a careful look at this video and think about what you are saying. These are soft La Raza gangsters in my opinion unlike the serious La Raza cliques in Los Angeles which are 10 to 100 times worse and more dangerous than these San Diego surenos.</p>

			<p>As a white living in an Hispanic area of L.A. for years, I NOT ONCE experienced harassment, nor even so much as an askance comment or glance from a Hispanic individual. Even as gangs ultimately tussle over turf, the competition between the two ethnic groups [comprising most gang activity in Los Angeles] is easily demarcated by skin color tags: brown means Hispanics, and black means African-American &hellip; therefore it&rsquo;s an easy but ruthlessly brutal call in using those demarcations to flag hits. Whites do not currently form part of L.A. gang culture, so are not players in this internecine racial gang-bang exchange. Brown &lsquo;people of color&rsquo; can&rsquo;t effectively be called racist by blacks, and if blacks do call them racists, Hispanics certainly couldn&rsquo;t care less. The getting can be much like the giving in this relatively newly emergent, deadly milieu.</p>

<p>    - the guys in that video are so White blooded it is easy to see why these Hispanic gangs side with the Whites in the California prison system. The term &#8220;Paisa&#8221; that the gang member used is a derogatory term for a full blooded Mexican, non English speaking, illegal alien type. These guys are of a different class. These are California kids, born and raised, lots of White blood mixed in.</p>

To Unemployed WASP: </p>
<p>I watched the youtube video you posted at 12:15 PM on June 15, and you are right: these Raza gangstas are no better than the black kind. </p>
<p>In fact, there is nothing but their skin color to distinguish or differentiate these brown criminals from the more familiar black criminals. For a bunch of people who claim to hate blacks and feel superior to them, it&rsquo;s amazing how much black culture these mestizos have absorbed and incorporated into &#8220;their&#8221; style. The baggy sports wear, the droopy pants, the shaved heads, the gold chains, the boasting and threatening, the spontaneous brawling, the incessant use of ghetto slang and cussing, hell, and even the swaggering/shuffling way they walk, EVERY ONE of these traits are BLACK. </p>
<p>I urge every AmRen reader to follow Unemployed WASP&rsquo;s link and watch that video. Yes, it&rsquo;s disturbing   &mdash;   as are the other &#8220;music videos&#8221; by these same characters   &mdash;   but it&rsquo;s also enlightening. It will demonstrate this to anyone still naive about the nature of mestizos: that brown is a lot closer to black than it is to white. <br>

			<p>  Gangs are not the number one reason to be against massive 3rd world, labor driven immigration, both legal and &#8220;illegal&#8221;.<br>
  Its true that gangs exist and always bring down the quality of life for those with the misfortune of living in areas where they are active.<br>
    For the most part, gangs don&rsquo;t go out of thier way to target &#8220;innocent bystanders&#8221;, although of course at times they will attack at random,but most of the &#8220;gangbanging&#8221; violence is directed toward other gang members and thier associates and not against the public at large.<br>
  This massive sudden influx of Hispanic immigration, although on an individual basis, many of these may indeed be &#8220;good people&#8221;, but this tidal surge of humanity into our country effects us in so many countless ways besides just the obvious visible scourge of &#8220;gang warfare&#8221;.</p>

<p>2 presidents and one governor lived in compton in the early fifties.  Both parents came fron Forbes magazine 500 richest families in America.  Both grew up in Greenwich Conn type huge mansions in 20 acres of parkland.</p>
<p>The young husband decided to get out of the family business and go into oil.  His first step was to work as a management trainee with one of the big oil companies in S. California.</p>
<p>They bought a house in compton, which was then a nice lower middle class well paid working class suburb. (Those of us over 60 will remember the well paid working class which has disappeared due to immigration and employer greed.)</p>
<p>One of the young couple&rsquo;s children was born while they lived in a small 15000 sq ft house in Compton.</p>
<p>What was the young couple&rsquo;s name???</p>
<p>George and Barbara Bush.</p>
<p>Who are the presidents and governor?????</p>
<p>George H Bush and George W Bush and the governor is Jeb Bush</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the type of town Compton was 60 years ago.  It took only about 10 years, 1965 to 1975 for the blacks to totally destroy the town.</p>

			<p>Thank you The Incredible Shrinking White Man and I appreciate your insight. We are all in a state of growth and sharing our understanding with each other.  </p>
<p>That video is just a rapper from an Inland Empire barrio dissing San Diego rappers from their respective cliques which I don&rsquo;t think I communicated well in my last post.</p>
<p>My point though certainly is accurate. These are the kind of La Raza neighbors we really don&rsquo;t even sweat in Los Angeles. They are everywhere and probably number a couple million in LA county. It&rsquo;s the eighty thousand or so real deep and dark La Raza gangsters that we do fear. </p>
<p>I hope this makes sense. Personally, I am a law abiding tax paying educated hard working veteran who has never received more than traffic citations my entire life. But I have to live my life in very careful certain way because of a latino invasion that really got going with the federal Bracero Program in 1942 that by my lifetime created the current paradigm we have here today. </p>
<p>Read The Paleo Conservatist&rsquo;s latest article on illegal immigration. Good perspective there.</p>

			<p><i>During World War Two, the Mexicans there were beating up sailors, just because they were white.</i></p>
<p><i>When I was lost on a borrowed bicycle on my way home from a party in downtown Nanjing, China one night in 1987, I never felt unsafe, despite being an obvious stranger. In Japan while on loan to a chemical company there, I was out at night all the time, and never felt unsafe. When my wife&rsquo;s care was out of commission last year and I had to walk to the grocery store, I was stared at and followed by four young blacks. I felt unsafe.</i></p>
<p><i>What we are seeing in Los Angeles is the normal breakdown of society when integration is forced upon people who do not want it. This is why we used to have national borders.</i></p>
<p><i>Posted by at 7:14 PM on June 13 </i></p>
<p>On a vacation 10 yrs ago, I also walked around several massive Chinese cities alone and <i>never</i> felt unsafe.  As a woman who grew up in American cities, being able to safely stroll down dark streets was an other-worldly feeling.  I&rsquo;ll admit it made me feel a little ashamed of my community; I don&rsquo;t even dare walk alone after dark <b>in my own neighborhood</b>!  In spite of their poverty, Chinese women are truly blessed to be free from the day-to-day fear of violent minorities.  </p>
<p>Someday I want to feel safe enough in my community to take my dog out for a leisurely pre-dawn walk.  That shouldn&rsquo;t be so much to ask in the wealthiest country in the world, should it??  President Obama will NOT get us there.  Remember that in November when you vote&hellip;  </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t share Baca&rsquo;s optimism about being able to pacify gang members. White people are deluding themselves if they think we can stay out of the fray for much longer given the rapid demographic change.  When blacks are ethnically cleansed from an area they often seek refuge in mostly white locales.  Then whites begin moving out, Mexicans move in and race war ensues similar to what we see in LA.  There will come a time when whites have nowhere else to run to.  </p>
