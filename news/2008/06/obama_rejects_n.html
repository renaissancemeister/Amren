						<p>Barack Obama dismissed Ralph Nader&rsquo;s claim that the Democratic candidate is trying to &#8220;talk white&#8221; and has failed to challenge the power structure to appeal to &#8220;white guilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a story published Wednesday, the Denver-based Rocky Mountain News reported that Nader said he was not impressed with Obama and that the senator was playing down poverty issues. The interview took place Monday in Washington, the News reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s only one thing different about Barack Obama when it comes to being a Democratic presidential candidate. He&rsquo;s half African-American,&#8221; Nader said. &#8220;Whether that will make any difference, I don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos. Payday loans, predatory lending, asbestos, lead. What&rsquo;s keeping him from doing that? Is it because he wants to talk white? He doesn&rsquo;t want to appear like Jesse Jackson?&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked if Obama does try to &#8220;talk white,&#8221; Nader replied, &#8220;Of course.&#8221; He also said that Obama doesn&rsquo;t want to appear to be &#8220;another politically threatening African-American politician.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to appeal to white guilt,&#8221; Nader said. &#8220;You appeal to white guilt not by coming on as black is beautiful, black is powerful. Basically he&rsquo;s coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure, whether it&rsquo;s corporate or whether it&rsquo;s simply oligarchic. And they love it. Whites just eat it up.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It sounds like Ralph Nader is more anti-white than Obama.</p>
<p><i>Payday loans, predatory lending, asbestos, lead.</i></p>
<p>What??  Nader is clueless.  Predatory lending?  How is it predatory when it is the government that forces lenders to lend in certain neighborhoods that banks prefer to stay out of.</p>
<p>The selection of presidential candidates has never been worse.  <br>

			<p>Payday loans, predatory lending? Is that what Nader is all about, protecting the stupid from themselves? He&rsquo;s the one sounding much more like Jessee Jackson.</p>

			<p>Nader makes a point but he has to realize that black voters  are shallow and are going to vote for Obama no matter what he talks about.</p>

			<p>As usual, Nader is wrong, Obama is not &#8220;half African-American&#8221;, as his father was an African (Muslim bigamist), making Barack half African. So, Obama gets the affirmative action vote because everyone, especially white men, not voting for him will be persecuted as racists and bigots.</p>

			<p>Why does Obama need to waste his energy talking about black issues?  He&rsquo;s got the black vote in his pocket.  He could completely ignore them until November and still get over 90% of their votes.  Why make the effort?</p>

			<p>Well, now I have seen it all!</p>
<p>The madly absurd Communist Ralph Nader, finally gets something half correct?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You appeal to white guilt not by coming on as black is beautiful, black is powerful. Basically he&rsquo;s coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure, whether it&rsquo;s corporate or whether it&rsquo;s simply oligarchic. And they love it. Whites just eat it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed they do Comrade Nader, if they come from the &ldquo;right&rdquo;  side of the tracks in your Red netherworld. Or defined another way, the &ldquo;white power structure&rdquo; as it is today in the &ldquo;audaciously hoped&rdquo; for &ldquo;coming&rdquo; Utopian States of America, does act like this, and would simply like to see you go away, along with Hillary and Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;black is beautiful, black is powerful&rdquo; construct does need to be finessed in a USA of only a 65% white majority, unlike the past USA of 1980 to 1990 that began at 84% and ended 76% white across that decade. If anything, the 1990 to 2000 period saw to that; after all, was that not the reign of the &ldquo;first black president&rdquo; and his consequentially white wife, who endlessly and arrogantly applauded a coming &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; and &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; nonwhite majority USA?</p>
<p>Yep, certain elitist whites do &ldquo;eat that up,&rdquo; until they find themselves no longer eating it from the head of the table suddenly and inexplicably, from the appetizers through the desserts as was thought to be their &ldquo;divine right.&rdquo; </p>
<p>What a pity to be hoist and flamb√©ed on one&rsquo;s own petards!</p>

			<p>Nader knows Obama is attempting to win White voters.  He knows Blacks are going to vote for him no matter what.  When Obama wins - if he wins - there&rsquo;s going to be more Whites awakening as Obama will begin to show his true colors a bit more by supporting everything that favors Blacks.</p>

<p>Ralph Nader is Lebanese, is he not?  That would make him an Arab, not white.</p>

			<p>Regardless of Ralph Nader&rsquo;s claims&hellip; ANY White voter with even a modicum of intelligence can see Obama for the glib-talking snake-oil salesman and phony he is. That so many young voters are taken in by his spiel is deplorable, but expected, given the brainwashing our young people get as part of their schools&rsquo; educational curriculums.</p>
<p>Obama consistently mouths fine-sounding phrases about &#8216;needing to unite&rsquo;, &#8216;coming together&rsquo;, which on analysis mean NOTHING! For Obama to ascent to the presidency would be disastrous for America and its people. He is inexperienced, a closet racist with carefully concealed Muslim leanings&hellip; on what conceivable basis should we voters trust him with the most imporant job on this planet? His wife certainly has displayed HER racist views; as has Obama&rsquo;s close confidante and friend, his &#8220;Pastor&#8221; Jeremiah Wright. Had the Wright issue not come to light, do YOU really believe Obama would have &#8216;come clean&rsquo; and admitted to listening to twenty-some years of anti-White racism and racist rantings? If YOU really have faith in Obama&rsquo;s integrity and character, call me, please. I can make you a fantastic deal on a bridge in New York City   &mdash;   all you have to do is take the daily toll receipts to the bank.</p>

			<p>Hello everyone. I got wind of this site thru my reading of Steven Sailer&rsquo;s articles and in particular, his series of debates w/Jared Taylor. I&rsquo;m something of a frequent poster on Sailer&rsquo;s &#8220;iSteve&#8221; blogsite. </p>
<p>Wrt the issue at hand, I must say that I agree w/Nader, and this is coming from an African American who has never had any strong feelings for or against the man, and I feel the same way about Obama. To date, the only time I can recall Obama specifically addressing concerns germain to Black America, was back in March when he was forced to address the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright issue in his now (in)famous &#8220;Race Speech&#8221;, and last week when he excoriated Black fathers accross the board during a Father&rsquo;s Day address at a Chicago church. Other than that, it does indeed appear that Obama works hard to avoid &#8220;sounding too Black&#8221; in terms of intonation or in terms of issues being addressed. In the two occasions mentioned earlier, Obama came accross to me as an opportunist-no more so than any other politician that has come before him, but an opportunist nonetheless. </p>
<p>Although it is widely true that Black America overwhelmingly supports Obama, there remains a small percentage who are either on the fence about the man, or, who outright reject his candidacy. For my part, he is simply too inexperienced, confused about his own racial identity, and potentially dishonest about his personal associations for me to take him seriously. I would have liked to see a Gen. Colin Powell as candidate but, as we know there are still some Whites in this country who are likely to try and take a Black man out its understandable why he chose not to run. </p>
<p>My own view on Obama is that he is indeed something of an empty suit, who appears to have made his bones in Chi-town in order to get/build his street cred, and who isn&rsquo;t that great of a debater, hence his trouncing by Hillary Clinton and his refusal to do a kind of Lincoln-Douglass debates. His policy prescriptions leave a lot to be desired, and does seem to pander to certain groups. At this point I favor McCain, but anything can happen btw now &amp; Nov. </p>

<p>He can&rsquo;t be worse for blacks than Johnson, Nixon and the federal Judges who created the no whites need apply affirmative laws, and Ford, Carter, Reagan (especially amnesty)Bush sr. Clinton and Bush jr who enforced and expanded affirmative action.</p>
<p>With whites like the above banning us from employment, Obama can hardly do worse.  </p>

			<p>If, Senator Obama becomes President Obama, and I think that he will, expect to see a new twist on the old generalization: &#8220;You can take the African out of the jungle but not the jungle out of the African&#8221;!</p>
<p>Irrespective of being bathed, sanitized, perfumed, puffed, and fluffed at Harvard, under the multicultural shower heads of affirmative action and political correctness, expect to see President Obama ultimately acting and thinking like the mulatto African - American radical that he truly is!</p>
<p>Consequently, one would guess that the love that Senator Obama can be expected to exhibit toward whites will closely parallel, if not exceed, the unabridged love that most members who post here routinely exhibit toward gentlemen de colour!<br>

<p>Exactamente. To my mind there is no doubt whatsoever, that the Obama clan would still be loyal and loving members of that hate-spewing Church of Bigots had it&rsquo;s public exposure not become a source of embarrasment to him.  What beggars belief is that even as he is exposed as the most distrustful, dishonest and unpatriotic presidential candidate I can recall, he is being lauded by so many. In every interview I have heard where Democrats are asked why they are voting for Obama, their only response is &#8216;its time for change&rsquo;. Is this ever typical of thoughtless, selfish people whose minds are full of hate and who just want more stuff, who hate Geo. Bush/Iraq war because they&rsquo;ve been feminised into believing that all war is bad; (I can&rsquo;t stand Bush, but nothing on earth would make me want to have this nincompoop as POTUS); and Lord save us from the zillions of white women going ga-ga over Obama&rsquo;s ugly mug.<br>
Arc.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only White liberals that spout multicultural diversity propaganda and most blacks and hispanics don&rsquo;t share those views.  They only play along because it&rsquo;s the only ticket in town, at the moment.  The time will come, however, when one of the nonwhite groups, maybe in combination with another, will dominate the political left.  When that happens, these White liberals will get thumped.  The logical conclusion here is that their liberal thinking will result in a loss of power.</p>
