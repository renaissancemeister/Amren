<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Below are excerpts from the Q&A; with Nobel laureate and DNA pioneer James Watson.</p>
<p>James Watson: I&rsquo;ve thought about these things a lot over the last couple of months, because those who know me well, you know, I&rsquo;m mortified by those three sentences in the Sunday Times article. I&rsquo;m not a monster, and yet, if you took them at their face value, I seem to be nasty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>JW: One sentence was just taken out of my book. It was [that] we shouldn&rsquo;t expect that people in different parts of the world have equal intelligence, because we don&rsquo;t know that. [Some] people say that they should be the same. I think the answer is we don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With the other two sentences, I talked to [the Times reporter] for eight hours. When I read the [quotes], I had no memory whatsoever of ever saying them. Because if I&rsquo;d said anything like that, it was so inappropriate!</p>
<p>HLG: Well, are you gloomy about the future of Africa?</p>
<p>JW: Not if we educate them. I think we&rsquo;ve got to focus on education.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A LINK BETWEEN COLOR AND SEX DRIVE? </p>
<p>HLG: You were quoted [in the Times of London article ] as saying you thought there was a relationship between color and libido, or sex drive.</p>
<p>JW: The remark I was telling was a joke. There was a poem by Byron, the sun makes you frisky. It was the link between the sun and sexuality. Well, if you get out in the sun, you will be more sexual. Ten years ago, someone was trying to produce a product that would turn your skin dark. He was making a chemical derivative of a stimulating hormone, which is turned out when your skin tans. He injected it into himself and he got a 10-hour erection.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ON JEWISH INTELLIGENCE</p>
<p>JW: The Jewish people are terrified of [discovering the] genes behind Jewish success, because it will lead to &mdash; </p>
<p>HLG: Do you think that&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>JW: I know it&rsquo;s not Jewish food.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>JW: Oh, Jewish intelligence, ah, the Irish will do all right. So I&rsquo;m not particularly worried about the fact that we&rsquo;re not all the same. I&rsquo;m really much more concerned with social justice, that everyone has a place in society. That&rsquo;s really what I&rsquo;m concerned with. &hellip; If they find genes for all kinds of Jewish intelligence, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to affect me in the slightest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>HLG: Do you think it is even remotely possible that we will find that there are genetic bases for the different performance of ethnic groups on these standardized tests?</p>
<p>JW: There was a difference between the Scotch and Irish, and it suddenly disappeared.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.nbsp;. A 10-point difference can disappear pretty fast.</p>
<p>JW: We could change things through better schools, or we could change things through medicines. We certainly know if you had very poor nutrition and you don&rsquo;t have enough iodine, that&rsquo;s going to stamp a whole people. And to what extent poverty in Africa is related to this &mdash; nutrition or no nutrition &mdash; we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>ON GENES AND BASKETBALL  (SEE VIDEO)</p>
<p>JW: I was watching the basketball games yesterday. And I&rsquo;m just trying to say, you dominate.</p>
<p>HLG: Oh, you mean black people?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>JW: I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s due to. Because we haven&rsquo;t found genes. You know, genes depending on what sort of types of muscles, slow twitch, fast twitch. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to change things much. White runners will still try to beat black runners. And they&rsquo;ll largely lose. But they&rsquo;re gonna try. If you&rsquo;re a sprinter, you&rsquo;re going to try to run as fast as you can.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ON HUMAN NATURE</p>
<p>HLG: Imagine if you were an African or an African-American intellectual. And it&rsquo;s 10 years from now. And you pick up The New York Times and some geneticist says, A) that intelligence is genetic, and B) the difference as measured on standardized tests between black people and white people, is traceable to a genetic basis. What would you, as a black intellectual, do, do you think?</p>
<p>JW: I don&rsquo;t think I can answer, because I don&rsquo;t think it will change things much</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>JW: No, no, no. Because in my lifetime, I&rsquo;ve seen less and less discrimination. And I think it&rsquo;ll continue that way.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>JW: I am convinced that the movement towards personalized genetics is going to improve their lives. Black people and white people, we&rsquo;re going to both be better because of this knowledge. Everyone should be judged [as] individuals. No one should be judged by a term like &#8220;black.&#8221; So I&rsquo;m optimistic about where we&rsquo;re going. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to lead to people being just discriminated. I see them being helped by knowing what genes might affect your health, and also in understanding when you don&rsquo;t fit in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>HLG: It&rsquo;s just that racists are determined to use biology to re-enslave black people, to delimit black people.</p>
<p>JW: Yeah, but it&rsquo;s not the historic norm. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to go that way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.   I don&rsquo;t think genetics is going to make that much of a difference.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FUTURE IMPLICATIONS OF DNA RESEARCH</p>
<p>HLG: Let me ask a moral question. If we found out 10 years from now, I come back and I interview you, and geneticists have found a biological basis of intelligence. And the worst of all nightmares is that some people in the human community are genetically different in terms of their intelligence and thoughts. Should we prevent that kind of discovery, given it&rsquo;s &mdash; </p>
<p>JW: I don&rsquo;t think we can prevent the discoveries. [That would] prevent any possibility of using knowledge to make people&rsquo;s lives better, so I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the way to go. I do think we have a moral question, a very serious moral question.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To what extent do you help people, at the bottom? What is called social Darwinism, you know, let them go extinct, I find repulsive.</p>

					<p>Raising the intellegence of blacks to that of other non African races would take many dozens of generations.William Shockley made the same mistake.If their intellegence is not what ours is, so what?Why dont we just learn how to live with it, instead of attempting the impossible?Miscignation will have a much stronger effect on raising the intellegence of blacks than selective breeding.</p>

<p><em>So that&rsquo;s all science comes down to. Not finding truth, but just the final battle (after which I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get our uptopia) in the war on racism. Gates seems to see where the evidence is headed (&rdquo;some scientist somewhere will claim to have proven this through our genes&rdquo;-although finding the exact genes with 100% certainty isn&rsquo;t necessary for social implications, see my <span class="caps">FAQ</span>) but doesn&rsquo;t seem to care and can&rsquo;t get beyond any question but &ldquo;Is it good for blackness?&rdquo; </em></p>

					<p>I think family raising, personality, culture, and education  have more to do with intelligence amongst different races than genes do. </p>
<p>Emotional intelligence(nurtured by parents in a child&rsquo;s environment) is as important as academic intelligence with respect to being successful or just surviving in the real world.</p>
<p>A kid can be a genius with no social skills. Let&rsquo;s just hope there is an outlet for him to use that intellect. He might not know anything else to do or be, but there&rsquo;s more to life. </p>

<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no question of it he&rsquo;s allowed the multicults to beat him down.  Such a spineless example of humanity.  What he said to begin with was in an unguarded moment, the only time when the elitists might accidentally reveal the truth.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s back peddaling, concerned that the limp-wristed academics might ostracize him for being truthful and he needs their disgusting approval.  Such a classless wimp.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many whites out there just like him, eager to please the black miscreants, and it seems there are fewer everyday who have the backbone to stand up for what is right for whites.</p>
<p>This kind of attitude is why there are so many whites supporting this Obama.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder who on the so-called White Right will vote for this Obama, not because they want a worse is better scenario, but because they&rsquo;ve been duped like all the rest.  I&rsquo;m willing to bet there are those on this forum here who will support him, because they&rsquo;ve been tricked into believing he&rsquo;s right for whites too.  If whites don&rsquo;t rid themselves of their gullibles, they&rsquo;ll be on the road to Hell for certain.</p>

					<p>This was a very poor interview. </p>
<p>Henry Louis Gates Jr  failed to dig deep and politely lobbed softballs at Watson out of respect. And Watson just stuttered through it, backpedaling on the truth and retreating into political correctness. </p>
<p>If Henry Louis Gates Jr had <span class="caps">REALLY </span>wanted to get some answers, he would have interviewed Phillipe Rushton who has a broader and more holistic grasp of the subject.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think Gates really <span class="caps">WANTS </span>to know the truth on this issue - he&rsquo;s afraid of what he might find, something he alludes to in his companion article &#8220;The Science of Racism&#8221;.  </p>

					<p><i>James Watson now says education can eliminate the intelligence gap.</i></p>
<p>There is not even a shred of evidence for it.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Liberal&#8221; scholars, and those under their control, keep sumarily dismissin plausible theories that contradict &#8220;Liberal&#8221; ideology with just one statement: &#8220;There is no evidence for it.&#8221; Their stubborn denial of reality, unless somene proves they are wrong (not an easy proposition taking their unwillingness to accept inconveninent truth), has been proverbial.</p>
<p>Well, untill an unproven claim supports the &#8220;Liberal&#8221; ideology. Then no matter how baseless, if not outright absurd, it is they are gona accept it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liberalism&#8221; is a (mild) mantal disorder, sometimes self-inflicted, that has naivete or dishonesty, or both, as moth typical sympthoms.<br>

<p>The lies and distortions that never get called to the carpet. Mr Gates we don&rsquo;t want to enslave anyone besides it seems as if you are already &#8220;enslaved&#8221;. We just want to be away from you and people like you.</p>
<p><br>
Apparently Mr Watson has been &#8220;Educated&#8221; or rather reeducated himself. PC is truly a sickness.</p>

					<p>What struck me about Watson&rsquo;s comments a couple months ago was the casual way he let it out, as if it was common knowledge.  He seeming to have no idea that he was saying anything really controversial, just impolite, as if speaking ill of an unpopular colleague.  I took that to mean that his fellow researchers, his day-to-day companions, share his view.  I think it likely that he&rsquo;s being pressured to publicly  recant his views at length, in order to protect the funding for his friends&rsquo; research.<br>

					<p>James Watson, like most scientists, is a dizzy little child. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad he got his rear end spanked for making those (obviously true) statements about black intelligence. Children deserve to be spanked when they talk back to their elders.</p>
<p>However high his base scientific &#8220;intelligence&#8221; might be, James Watson still isn&rsquo;t half the man or scientist Arthur Jensen is.</p>

					<p>The conversation between Watson and Gates is the most infantile, evasive rubbish I have read in ages. </p>
<p>For example, it is a fact that the achievements of Jewish Americans are wildly out of proportion to their numbers. <br>
Anyone  who didn&rsquo;t know Jews are only ca. 2 <span>of the US population might suspect the were ca. 65 </span> or so.</p>
<p>It is intellectually dishonest to doubt the exceptional character of Jewish intelligence (no scare quotes needed), and both Watson and Gates know it.</p>
<p>As for the elusive black intelligence, it is disconcerting that Gates is the most prominent black intellelctul in the <span class="caps">US, </span>because he makes no sense &amp; obviously knows nothing about research into intelligence. </p>
<p>The central issue is never addressed by the duo of jabbering fools:</p>
<p>logically, either</p>
<p>a) blacks are by nature as intelligent as whites, but have been rendered mentally inferior by the terrible abuse inflicted by whites, in which case continued quotas and compensation are in order, although enoromous efforts in this direction have had little impact to date, </p>
<p>or else</p>
<p>b) blacks are less bright on average than whites for reasons related to evolutionary biology, and there is no obligation on the part of whites to fix them or hie them above their abilities.  </p>
<p>We need to know which is factualy the case, because every aspect of life in the US impoacted by race policies. </p>
<p>Only science can tell us which is true.</p>
<p>We need to let the scientists do their job and then accept their findings.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Well, are you gloomy about the future of Africa? <span class="caps">NOT</span> IF WE <span class="caps">EDUCATE THEM.</span>&#8221; </p>
<p>The quote above, out of all this, just lept off the page for me. If &#8220;We&#8221; educate &#8220;them?&#8221; So who educated &#8220;us&#8221; in the first place Dr. Watson, that we may educate anyone? &#8220;We&#8221; ultimately educated ourselves did we not? We required no alien people to educate us in anything!<br>
Why on earth should it be necessary to educate &#8220;them&#8221; if indeed we are all equally equiped in terms of intellectual capacity? Watson is no doubt a brilliant man but is also, sad to say, an intellectual coward - he contradicts his own flimsy arguments even as he protests against his original comments! He talks about &#8220;education&#8221; like it is as easy as teaching nearly an entire continent of millions of backward people a few classroom lessons, ans passing out a couple textbooks and pencil-boxes! What utter foolishness!! I am disgusted&hellip;<br><br>

					<p>I must say, I am not at all convinced that Jewish intelligence is superior than, say, non-Jewish Whites in Europe and North America. Personally I think their primary characteristics are - Group Cohesion and Single-mindedness of purpose.  The first gives them a confidence and assertiveness, and the second enables them to concentrate on a particular aim.</p>
<p>However, I would be interested in finding out if there is a gene that makes people insist that the entire Planet Earth love them unconditionally.  Also, it would be interesting to see if there&rsquo;s a gene that makes a people need to be placed above criticism while allowing them to not only criticize, but demonize anyone they please.  And finally, I would love to know if there&rsquo;s a gene responsible for a people creating for themselves and no one else, a Myth of Innocence which says that they never do anything wrong, things are done to them. <br>
If we knew this then we could help them to change and make the necessary adjustments to reality, where the rest of us are expected to live, and do.<br><br>
Somehow I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s exactly what Dr. James &#8220;No Self-Respect, Cringing Coward&#8221; Watson was talking about when he refered to &#8220;Education.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to grab Watson by the lapels shake him and say, &ldquo;Get a hold yourself Jim, die like a man.&rdquo;  Or some such thing, but I&rsquo;ve never been where he is.  Strange, if he had been caught in bed with a boy rather than draw a logical conclusion he&rsquo;d have less mental turmoil to deal with.   </p>

					<p>&#8220;JW: There was a difference between the Scotch and Irish, and it suddenly disappeared&hellip;nbsp;. A 10-point difference can disappear pretty fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>There needs to be more scientific study of these arenas in order to understand how <span class="caps">DNA </span>affects intelligence.  What causes the difference between Scotch and Irish intelligence to change?  Well, clearly the Irish diet changed dramatically from starvation conditions to well-rounded, along with a world-class educational system.</p>
<p>In Europe, nations that were subdued by more powerful nations for a considerable time did not prosper.  A correlated point: they did not have high IQs.  Once they overcame these obstacles, they shot up.  Eastern European countries are encountering this success currently.</p>
<p>The question is: is the same possible for African countries?  There are African countries that are currently subdued by dictatorships etc, but some are not.  And yet, they do not succeed.  Is it climate?  Or is it genetic?</p>
<p>More study is required, but I lean toward the genetic cause.  I think Dr. Rushton&rsquo;s 50% environmental, 50% genetic causes are about right.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s better to spread lies and continue to blame innocent whites for that failings of some ethnic groups. But wouldn&rsquo;t genetic research actually empower black people when it&rsquo;s proven that the racists are wrong about intelligence? I mean, we all really believe that, right?</p>
<p>This reminds me of &#8216;professional&rsquo; psychics, faith-healers and other scam-artists who make all sorts of wild claims and yet resist any scientific testing to prove them. Deep down they know the truth as well as anyone, but the truth will send them broke and so lies are preferable.</p>

					<p>The fact that a European nation like Ireland could raise IQ through diet &amp; education is encouraging, and it can and has been done in Africa, in a few countries. </p>
<p>But raised how far? Up to the low 80s? </p>
<p>To bring African IQ up the the levels of US blacks (let alone whies) would be extraordinarily difficult, and most US blacks are failing miserably.</p>
<p>Watson knows all this, but has been either intimidated, threateend, or persuaded that it is better to stick to evasions and lies than to talk straight about race and <span class="caps">IQ.</span></p>

<p>My question: What is more racist? And why?&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more racist to say &#8216;black IQ wont catch up&rsquo;. Duh! Anything whites say is racist&hellip; it&rsquo;s simply a matter of degree.</p>
<p>My own comment reminds me of a women&rsquo;s studies lecture I sat through once&hellip; covering I believe Andre Lorde and about how any sex between a man and a woman is rape, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of degree. The teacher wrote a big long line across the chalkboard - a scale labeling the different degrees, all of it rape of course. </p>
<p>I always suspected Andre Lorde, and a Couple of the other feminists we studied, were closet &#8216;conservatives&rsquo; in actuality. The problem is no matter how bizarre the theories could become, in an attempt to make fun of themselves apparently, the students would still eat if up as gospel. </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ll go along with the view of most here that Watson bowed to political correctness. The only difference I see between Watson and most whites who grovel and beg forgiveness when the media hangs them out to dry for speaking truthfully, is age. Mr Watson is an old man. He probably just wants all this to go away and to be left alone. He is too old to fight. </p>

There is only one word to describe it, viz. the most vile type of appeasement.</p>

					<p>There was never a substantial biological difference between the Scots and Irish, so the Irish always possessed the same potential (IQ) as Scots.  Watson&rsquo;s whole argument makes him look not only like a spineless appeaser, but someone who forgot how to lie at about age six and is only now rediscovering it.</p>

					<p>Andrea Dworkin, not Andre Lorde, said all het sexual intercourse is rape. Well, she more or less said that. It&rsquo;s complicated. I actually agree with her on that, but that&rsquo;s the way that evolution wanted it and that&rsquo;s the way that both men and women like it. My position differs from Dworkin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Andrea Dworkin actually said that, <strong>under existing conditions of patriarchy</strong>,  all het sex is rape.</p>
