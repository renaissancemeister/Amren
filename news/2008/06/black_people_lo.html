			<p>I found that site funny!  It just makes fun of those liberal whites and their condescending attitudes.</p>

			<p>Most white liberals don&rsquo;t even like black people. They just like the &#8220;moral capital&#8221; blacks offer them.</p>
<p><br>
This is a much funnier parody: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xJzAYYrX8" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xJzAYYrX8</a></p>

			<p>While this site is meant as a parody, I think it does highlight the attitude of many whites. The old cliche &#8220;Some of my best friends are black&#8221; is legendary. White people wear the claim of black friends like a gold star on their chest. There are probably interesting psychological reasons for this. Most whites instinctively know that blacks (and really anyone of a strikingly different racial background from oneself) are inherently harder to get along with than those of ones own race. So if they can claim black friends, they think that it proves that they must be remarkably likable and easy <br>
-to-get-along-with people to be able to overcome such obstacles. It&rsquo;s really a form of self-aggrandizement.</p>

			<p>I first discovered that website about a decade ago, and even though I always assumed in was a spoof site, a part of me still cringed while reading it.</p>

			<p>My guess is that this website was created as an &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; project - notice the links published on one page of their site. Still, this is pretty good parody - for what it is.</p>
<p>Thanks, James, for the link you posted. That youtube video is funnier!</p>

			<p>It is a funny site, but the reason we find it funny is completely contrary to the intentions of the hard leftists behind the site. Someone on Amren posted something on this topic many months ago that I have not forgotten. Something to the effect of: having no black friends means not having to deal with the problems that come with having black friends. How many friends can a person have anyway? There are more than enough white people to fill those slots who don&rsquo;t come with any extra baggage.</p>

			<p>Do you think Bill and Hillary thought black people loved them?</p>
<p>They pandered to them for 8 years. Remember he was our 1st &#8220;black President&#8221;.</p>
<p>All of a sudden Obama came along and black people threw the Clintons overboard. But of course not before calling them racists.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to read some of the letters to the Black People Love Us site. They seem divided entirely into &#8216;this is racist parody&rsquo; hostility and &#8216;this is anti-racist parody&rsquo; appreciation. The latter is the correct interpretation, of course; like AR reader Janelle above, I agree that the links section of the site is the giveaway: all 17 links are to profoundly black websites, from &#8216;The Official Kwanzaa Website&rsquo; to the NAACP to the Nation of Islam. </p>
<p>These links are proof that AR readers should be under no illusion that there is any third possible interpretation of this site favorable to us, ie that it is &#8216;anti-liberal parody.&rsquo; If anything, the underlying message of the site is &#8216;liberals must take their anti-racism seriously, and not engage in ANY stereotyping, unless it is to parody such stereotyping - all blacks you need to know about behave like white college students - just ignore the vastly more numerous street blacks spinning on America&rsquo;s sidewalks, it&rsquo;s not safe to patronize them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here is some 2002 commentary on the site from racematters.org, archived at       <a href="http://www.racematters.org/blackpeopleloveus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.racematters.org/blackpeopleloveus.htm</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Web site is the creation of a white, twentysomething sister and brother, Chelsea and Jonah Peretti&hellip; Sally and Johnny are indeed fictional characters portrayed by friends of the Perettis. The two creators&rsquo; father is Jewish and their mother Italian. When they were mere tykes, their parents divorced. Their father married a black woman, infusing the two with a totally new cultural awareness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having said all this, the site IS admittedly clever. And if it gets even one liberal to realize that there is NOTHING they can do to get close to blacks that is politically correct, and therefore the best thing to do is maintain maximum separation, then it will have served a useful purpose.</p>

			<p>In Malcolm X&rsquo;s autobiography he makes a comment about the way white people smell when wet, this website makes the same point- like dog, apparantly. We cannot ever seem to make ourselves smell so bad that they do not want to move to our countries/towns/streets, though. </p>

<p>The only thing in the MSM that comes near to illustrating this was &#8220;Seinfeld.&#8221;  Recall the episode where George is trying to prove he is not a racist and has black friends.</p>

			<p>I went to a club last week waiting to use the bathroom.  A black towel man was polite and said to me, &#8220;Oh, sir, there&rsquo;s an open stall there.&#8221;  To which some smart alek white kid said, &#8220;yeah, keep those whites in line&#8221;  I said, &#8220;he&rsquo;s just self-hating.&#8221;  As an earlier poster said, those whites just brow beat other whites to show off and feel like they&rsquo;re &#8220;not racist&#8221;.  </p>

<p>Yes, those white devils are oppressive, evil, greedy, but as long as they can get money from the white man and sex from the white woman, it&rsquo;s worth it to them.</p>

			<p>I feel so guilty now for coming from a wealthier than average family,  being college educated, having a good job, and being so white.  I loathe my whiteness and my European heritage.  I pray that in my next life, I will be blackest of the black with minimal prospects outside of being the hippest gangster, doing more broads and having more fun than I ever had in this life.</p>
