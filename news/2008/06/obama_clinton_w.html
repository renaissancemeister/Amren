<h1>Obama, Clinton Woo American Indian Voters</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Brown and Mary Clare Jalonick, AP, June 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The newly named Awe Kooda Bilaxpak Kuuxshish &mdash; better known as Barack Obama &mdash; faced east, the symbolic source of new life. His adopted Crow father, Hartford Black Eagle, prayed over him.</p>
<p>Afterward, they walked arm-in-arm with Black Eagle&rsquo;s wife, Mary, to a podium, where Obama promised to live up to the meaning of his new name: &#8220;One Who Helps People Throughout the Land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to know that I will never forget you,&#8221; Obama told the crowd, who had not seen a visitor of such political importance since Lady Bird Johnson came to the Montana reservation in the 1960s. &#8220;You will be on my mind every day that I am in the White House.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a tight Democratic race, American Indians living in poor conditions on isolated prairie reservations could have a pivotal voice in the selection of a presidential candidate. As a result, they&rsquo;re hearing a lot of promises from politicians: better health care, improved housing and stepped-up law enforcement in Indian country.</p>
<p>Their votes could be decisive in the last two Democratic primaries, the June 3 votes in Montana and South Dakota, that Obama would very much like to win to bring him closer to the Democratic nomination. He and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who&rsquo;d like victories just as much, are wooing the oft-ignored Indian vote &mdash; which is small, but big enough to matter this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reservations, especially the poor, remote tribal areas in the High Plains, have rarely been campaign stops in recent years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Almost 9 percent of South Dakota&rsquo;s roughly 800,000 residents are American Indian &mdash; the third highest population in the country. Around 6 percent of Montana&rsquo;s slightly larger population are American Indian. Those voters are traditionally Democratic, though Republicans have worked hard to woo them in recent elections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Republicans&rsquo; likely nominee, John McCain, a former Senate Indian Affairs Committee chairman, is bidding for their votes too. He met with tribal leaders last week, promising, like Clinton and Obama, to create a new White House position to oversee Indian affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t rely on promises so much as we do their ability to understand our issues,&#8221; said Robert Moore, an elected official in South Dakota&rsquo;s Rosebud Sioux Tribe and volunteer organizer for Obama.</p>
<p>No matter who wins, say leaders, American Indians expect more attention from the next administration.</p>
