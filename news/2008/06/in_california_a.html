						<p>One of the last bastions of racial segregation will be breached next month. Trailing most US states, California will start fully integrating its prison cells beginning July 1.</p>
<p>The change has both inmates and prison guards nervous about racial violence in America&rsquo;s largest state prison system. They depict race relations behind bars as a delicate truce in which one transgression can trigger a riot.</p>
<p>Among the most diverse in the nation, California&rsquo;s overcrowded prisons also have entrenched prison-gang cultures. Integration of prison cells will test the state&rsquo;s ability to tackle that problem peacefully. Officials behind the change, though, point to research that suggests any uptick in violence would be short-lived, followed by longer-term benefits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the other states where this has been done, it has assisted in gang management, reduced violence, reduced racial tension. And it helps with breaking down prejudicial barriers and reflects community norms,&rdquo; says Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).</p>
<p>The policy change comes in response to a legal challenge that rose to the US Supreme Court in 2004. No more than three states including Oklahoma still have segregated prisons.</p>
<p>Currently, new arrivals to a California prison are assigned temporary cellmates of the same race for 60 days. Blacks, whites, Hispanics, and &ldquo;others&rdquo; are kept separate from one another.</p>
<p>The rest of the prison system is technically integrated, according to officials, including dining halls, prison yards, and permanent cell assignments. In practice, however, inmates self-select along racial and ethnic lines. And while prisoners may request a permanent cellmate of a different race, they almost never do.</p>

			<p>I have often said this and stand by it, the Liberal/Progressive/Communists are so demented as a group, that they would rather see innocent people killed, even people that have commited relatively minor crimes, than take a close look at their cherished beliefs and the damage that some of those beliefs do.</p>

<i>&ldquo;In the other states where this has been done, it has assisted in gang management, reduced violence, reduced racial tension. And it helps with breaking down prejudicial barriers and reflects community norms&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve read this has been successfully done in other prisons. Later in the article, they cite Texas as an example.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Under the new rules, each incoming prisoner will be screened to determine gang affiliations, past racial violence, and willingness to integrate. Members of rival gangs won&rsquo;t be lumped together, so there won&rsquo;t be a member of the Mexican Mafia, for instance, sharing a 5-by-9-foot cell with someone from the Aryan Brotherhood.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This is how I imagined it could appear to work. As long as they integrate only those who are willing to integrate, it might work.</p>
<p>Of course, the best way to insure a white cellmate is to profess strong racial views.</p>
<p>The reality will be both voluntary integration and segregation.<br>

			<p>One of my friends beat up a black guy in the El Paso county jail while we were waiting to be driven to Denver by the FBI.  He had told staff not to lock him up with a black guy.  </p>
<p>He was actually fairly nice about the beating, and didn&rsquo;t hurt the kid too badly, but he figured the staff needed to be taught a lesson.  He was already facing a mandatory ten years for his felony charge (felon on parole with a gun), so assault &amp; battery misdemeanors didn&rsquo;t bother him.</p>
<p>One of the things the idiots who hand down these decisions don&rsquo;t understand is that being locked up is stressful all by itself and people develop funny quirks when they&rsquo;re crammed into an 8&rsquo; X 10&rsquo; room with a stranger.  Cellmates who are actually friends make the staff&rsquo;s jobs easier.  I had friends as cellmates twice, including the guy who&rsquo;s reading I helped with, a big, mean biker about the size of Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster.  Now that I&rsquo;m off probation, I write to him, and send him some money once in a while.  It was like being in the college dorms again.  I got him totally hooked on swords &amp; sorcery novels; we&rsquo;d just hang out in our room, smoke cigarettes and read; a massive non-problem for the corrections officers.</p>
<p>The other friend I shared a cell with was a Boer who expressly told the CO&rsquo;s that he wanted a white guy with a college education as a cellie, but that facility had us on 8-hour lockdown; he just wanted someone interesting to talk with.  We played rummy every evening, and I totally creamed him at it.  I got a letter from him later on telling me he was annihilating his new cellie at it.  He had been working on a ship and some would-be illegal immigrants had hid in the chain locker.  He knew, or at least suspected, and dropped the anchor anyway, resulting in the Africans getting pureed when the anchor chain flailed around in there while paying out.</p>
<p>I used to look foreward to meeting new people while I was locked up.  Perhaps my relatively benign experience with incarceration made it easier to avoid slipping up once I was out on supervised release.</p>
<p>One of the &#8220;law &amp; order&#8221; types will probably pipe up about &#8220;just punishment&#8221;, but what useful purpose would harsher punishment for non-violent offenders serve?  Releasing guys who made mistakes and don&rsquo;t want to again seems like a better deal for society than releasing hate-filled crazies.</p>

			<p>The last iota of sanity has now disappeared. I am waiting for some sort of Divine Intervention to cleanse the USA. If only this nation had not turned her back on the Christian principles it was founded on, then we never would have lost our way as badly as we have. This will mean more Whites will be violated, degraded, brutalized and murdered at the hands of those who should not even be on our shores. One appalling article after another.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Officials say violence caused by prison integration should only be &ldquo;short-lived.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>
<p>Afterwhich their mothers tucked them into bed with their teddy bears and assured them Santa would be coming during the night as they slept.</p>
<p>But, of course, I could be wrong, since the only thing I really know of the slammer is what I&rsquo;ve read, seen on T.V. and various domumentaries in film.</p>
<p>But I do know human nature and what the real world is all about, and I think this is really a BIG mistake.  I think the closest prison authorities will ever get to a peaceful integrated prison society is if they so closely monitor these inmates with cameras in the cells, etc., and have quick response teams that come down hard on and fights that start as a result of racial animosity between two inmates sharing the same cell, that trouble is stopped immediately.  But to maintain the peace will be tremendously stressful on the people doing the watching.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest problems that radical social enginners have is an inability to understand human nature and to know what the real world is all about.<br>

			<p>  So two professors have &#8220;studied the problem&#8221; and are convinced that integration of the prisons will work, eh? Well, I feel so much better now! Naturally the Supreme Court didn&rsquo;t conduct interviews with prison guards or prisoners themselves about whether the ill-considered change will be successful. No, they turned to the learned professors!</p>
<p> I remember many years ago talking with a friend who was a lay minister, and who regularly visited local guys who were in state prison. I asked my friend, &#8220;What could they do that would cut down on violence in the prisons?&#8221; He answered without hesitation, &#8220;If they would segregate all the prisoners by race, it would eliminate 90 percent of it.&#8221; And this was from a man who visited the prisons in our state regularly and talked with the prisoners there. I think he probably knew more about it than the learned professors quoted in this article.</p>

			<p>Odds are that this policy will be quietly ignored by corrections officers, jail deputies, and prisoners, none of whom have an incentive to get killed in fights or riots. They&rsquo;ll find a hundred little ways to keep the status quo. It&rsquo;d be interesting to see exactly how integrated the Texas system ever actually got. If the judges want integrated prisons, they can work in them themselves.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;ll be very interesting to see how CDC will get a handle on rioting prisons that are overcrowded, in some cases, four times beyond their design capacity.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s call this what it is a war on white survival inside prison walls. The whites have found a way to survive through gang affiliation. This will destroy white solidarity as they (whites) are the minority. Destruction of whites same as in society. </p>

			<p>When I was in the military a black guy stabbed a white guy ( his room-mate). When the black guys got out of jail they put him right back in the same room with the guy he stabbed. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I decided that the lunatics were running the asylum. I haven&rsquo;t seen anything to change my opinion of the government since than.</p>
<p>If all the violence and rapes that occur even in the military were reported to the public there would be a great difference of public opinion. Of the ten or so rapes that I was aware of not a single incident involed a white person other than being the victom and the same could be said for robbery. Whites tended to be guilty of drug charges and DUI&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>Our goverment is not for the people and is definitely not by the people. If the people are not informed they can&rsquo;t be expected to make important decisions ( law making process, voting ) and the government makes sure the people are not informed.</p>
<p>They still don&rsquo;t want to release the records of all the blacks that were guilty of murder and rape during world war two so what makes anyone think they will tell the truth about the situation in our prisons. </p>
<p>If most of our politicians were in prison ( where they should be ) with these blacks I&rsquo;m sure they would sing a different tune.  <br>

			<p>&#8221; so there won&rsquo;t be a member of the Mexican Mafia, for instance, sharing a 5-by-9-foot cell with someone from the Aryan Brotherhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am a retired California parole officer.  I have been told many times by hispanics that they don&rsquo;t mind sharing a cell with a white prisoner.  But they always totally refuse to share cells with blacks. Whites and hispanics are together against the blacks in the prisons.</p>
<p>I remember hearing a black criminal in the waiting room blabbling away as blacks are prone to do.  One of the things he said was &#8220;n&rsquo;ever dey&rsquo;s a riot, duh messicans side wit duh whites!!! erry time!!! erry time.</p>
<p>The percentage of white prisoners in California prisons is extremely, extremely low.  After 25 years dealing with criminal trash (who should never have been born) I am convinced that the reason there are so few whites in prison is that for whites, even for the Aryan brotherhood, living with and being raped and abused with all those blacks is so horrible that once exposed to it, whites reform.  The guards can&rsquo;t abuse the prisoners, but the prisoners abuse each other.</p>
<p>This is proof that serious punishment including beatings, torture and rape reforms criminals.</p>
<p>By the way, the Aryan brother are getting old.  So few whites have entered the prison system for the last 25 years that there are not enough younger whites to keep the brotherhood going.<br>

<p>When I was in the Army, a black guy punched a white guy in the face he&rsquo;d been arguing with. That was the extent of the fight, that&rsquo;s all that happened and the white guy didn&rsquo;t seem to be seriously hurt. The white guy was charged with &#8216;fighting&rsquo; and given official punishment, the black guy wasn&rsquo;t punished at all. I guess this is why &#8216;integration&rsquo; works so well in the Army (for blacks). </p>

			<p>1:59 PM is right, but not only the Mexicans, but the East Asians (very few were there) and American Indians (plenty inside with us) always sided with the whites in Federal prison.  I was at a &#8220;low&#8221; so the blacks were outnumbered two-to-one by the rest of us.  It was very peaceful.</p>
<p>The only allies the blacks had were Arabs and Pakistanis.  There was an Iranian, who (a) finding himself completely horrified at where he would up, and (b) quite suprised at how nice everybody was, decided he was white.  Traumatic Shock Therapy?  One of the Pakistanis was quite civil to me, showed me pictures of his family, and tried to convert me to Islam.  I told him that while it probably works great for him, that I was a practicing pagan.  He ended up settling for a clinically retarded white guy as his convert.  I rather doubt Mahmoud was planning to introduce his convert to his poor daughter when they got out.  At least I hope not.  No girl deserves that.</p>
<p>I could actually respect his dilemna as a prosletizer, after he said about potential converts, &#8220;the ones we can respect are unavailable to us.&#8221;  I never asked him whether that made him suspect he might be wrong.</p>
<p>He did once threaten a 19 year-old white inmate, after which I stopped talking with him.  My friend had lied to investigators about some stolen guns.  It wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;accessory after the fact&#8221;, which was too weak in his case, since he knew someone who knew the people who stole the guns, but &#8220;obstruction of justice.&#8221;  Since the case involved guns, he wasn&rsquo;t camp-eligible.  He should have been on probation.  I think a deferral with the record of conviction expunged after a few years would have been best.</p>
<p>He made some wisecrack about Islam after the 2003 invastion of Iraq, and the Pakistani said, &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to get you for that.&#8221;  A bunch of us were there, in the smoking room, as I was writing letters for folks who couldn&rsquo;t write so well, and one guy said, &#8220;No; we&rsquo;re going to get you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mahmoud took me aside, later on and asked me what I was doing.  I explained that the 19 year-old white guy hadn&rsquo;t travelled to Pakistan to commit crimes and threaten Pakistanis in their own country, so he had better at least do us North Americans the favor of refraining from the same.</p>
<p>Mexicans and whites did not mind each other as cellmates.  When blacks decided they owned the TV in Building 6a of the Denver county jail, and a race-riot was brewing, one of the Mexicans asked me if I was &#8220;with them.&#8221;  Since I was looking at a statutory max of 184 years if the sentences were stacked (three twenties and about 25 less serious felonies, all over things I had written,) - &#8220;stacked&#8221; means run cuncurrently - I said &#8220;yes.&#8221;  I believed at the time I was never getting out, so the prospects of getting killed in a riot or life for killing someone in a riot didn&rsquo;t particularly bother me.</p>
<p>With me went the rest of the white vote, and the riot never happened.  The black TV hogs were outnumbered, and backed down.  I didn&rsquo;t care about TV; I don&rsquo;t watch it, but I played chess with the Mexicans and whites, and some of them cared.</p>
<p>Segregation in county jails would be my first priority, if I were running things, as in county jails, the inmates are in for misdemeanors or are there as pre-trial felons, still under the legal presumption of innocence.  If you are locked up for unpaid parking tickets or still fighting out a case when you are only *accused* of doing the actual crime, you do not deserve to be mistreated by either staff or other inmates.</p>

			<p>If our supposed masters gave a damn, they&rsquo;d set up at least two systems, one with segregated prisons, and one with integrated prisons, each populated using statistics software to control for non-racial factors.  Then they&rsquo;d observe the effects for a few years and choose the better method.</p>
<p>Obviously they don&rsquo;t give a damn.  Doing it one way only is their way of building in a trap door (consciously or not); if there&rsquo;s a spike in violence after desegregation they can point the finger at something else.  Leftism in general is like this; it isn&rsquo;t enough that they have their way; <i>every corner of the west must fall under their hegemony</i>, so there&rsquo;s no control group free of their misanthropic experiments.</p>
<p>Leftists are virulently anti-science, as well as anti-humanist.</p>

			<p>The only reason this was done in CA is because Whites are an extreme minority in the prison system. The people behind this ruling know that and wish to have whites rubbed out. Why? Because it&rsquo;s getting easier and easier to put Whites who are &#8220;in the know&#8221; in jail for their &#8220;thought crimes&#8221; or trumped up &#8220;hate crime&#8221; charges. If they can get this going now, they&rsquo;ll be able to have their opposition wiped out in prison and not have to worry about doing anything out in the open that will garner attention.</p>
