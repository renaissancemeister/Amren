						<p>When Barack Obama, whose mother was white, identifies himself as black, and when Bill Richardson, whose father was white, identifies himself as Hispanic, who is white?</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau says the country will be majority-minority in 2050 &mdash; that is, the combined number of blacks, Asians, American Indians and Hispanics will put whites in the minority. Texas and California are already there.</p>
<p>But the definition of white keeps shifting. Groups have been welcomed in or booted out; people opt out, sue to get in or change their minds and jump back and forth.</p>
<p>The deepest racial divide, between blacks and nonblacks, endures. But there also are identity shifts among African-Americans, as Sen. Obama&rsquo;s success suggests. Some make it into the middle class, where education and social mobility may help shape their identities as much as race does. Others are left behind in increasingly segregated schools and neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The U.S. has never found it easy to assign race, although it certainly has tried. A century ago, the people who did the counting &mdash; demographers, sociologists, policy thinkers &mdash; divided whites into three strata. They considered Nordic whites, from England, Scandinavia and Germany, the most ethnically desirable and elite, followed by the Alpine whites, from eastern and central Europe, and finally the Mediterraneans. Everyone else was identified as black, red, yellow or brown, which included South Asians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1922, the Supreme Court decided that a Japanese man had white skin but wasn&rsquo;t ethnically Caucasian, and it denied him citizenship. A year later, it decided a South Asian was ethnically Caucasian but not white, and it denied him citizenship, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some minorities or multiracial Americans who were once counted as white are opting out of the category. The population calling itself Native American quadrupled when the Census Bureau began asking people to identify themselves by race rather than relying on its own enumerators to do the job.The number of Hawaiian dropped by half when the &ldquo;two or more races&rdquo; category was introduced.</p>
<p>Mexicans were long counted in the Census as whites because of an 1848 U.S.-Mexico treaty that allowed them citizenship; only whites and blacks could naturalize, so by that logic, Mexicans were white. But since 1980, Hispanics have had a separate Census category where even intermarried, non-Spanish speakers can include themselves, if they choose. One in eight people in the U.S. does, including Latin American, European and Caribbean Hispanics and their progeny.</p>
<p>Identity groups that once lobbied to be accepted as whites now see advantages in being nonwhite, including college-admission and hiring preferences. Some African-Americans who fear losing political power to the fast-growing Hispanic population have quietly urged Caribbeans and those of mixed race to identify themselves simply as black. Other minority groups are reclaiming their racial identities out of pride.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not likely to change soon. Some demographers predict that within a century, there will be as many Americans who are mixed-race as there will be those whose parents are both of the same race, further blurring color lines. But that &ldquo;hybridity,&rdquo; as demographers call it, will be concentrated among Hispanics and Asians who marry whites and each other, not among blacks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the definition of who is white may change again &mdash; and again. {snip}</p>

			<p>Bottom line of the entire article is that we&rsquo;ve created a mess that will only get worse, and, certainly, what they&rsquo;re telling us, but I&rsquo;m sure they don&rsquo;t realize it, is that we&rsquo;re becoming more and more a mass of squabbling racial entities that will never resolve our differences.</p>
<p>They made an attempt at drawing parallels with ethnic squabbling in the past, but they never succeeded with an argument that was even slightly convincing.</p>
<p>That this all is something that has occurred before and is doing so again comes across as about as flat as their heads.</p>
<p>Strange, isn&rsquo;t it that they never mentioned that multiracial societies never worked in the past?  I wonder if they&rsquo;re afraid to say so, because it will let the cat out of the bag and they may cause those asleep to wake up suddenly to the danger they are facing.</p>

			<p>  Barack Obama identifies himself as &#8220;black&#8221; because he LOOKS black. Can you imagine him trying to say, &#8220;Hey, I&rsquo;m White just like you folks!&#8221; It wouldn&rsquo;t wash in this country. Nappy hair, caramel-colored skin, thicker lips than the typical Caucasian, flatter nose   &mdash;   if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck &hellip;<br>
  In short, in the United States, you are what you look like. I have a smattering of Native American, or American Indian, heritage, but no one has ever mistaken me for one, because if I LOOK anything ethnically identifiable, it&rsquo;s probably Irish. If you look White   &mdash;   I mean, where no one is going to mistake you for anything else   &mdash;   then that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;ll be identified and treated in this country. We&rsquo;re not into the graduations of color like Brazilians are. Obama is a mulatto, true; but he&rsquo;s also black. He wouldn&rsquo;t be mistaken for anything else. Not here, anyway.</p>

Just think of the benefits! free college, easy jobs.</p>

			<p>Very simply, a White person is someone descended from Caucasians from Europe and whose bloodlines are pure, ie. not even a drop of blood from any other race or sub-race.</p>

			<p>I was wondering when the mainstream establishment rags were going to start pushing whiteness studies. Noel Ignatiev and his team at Harvard have been working on these &#8220;theories&#8221; for a couple of decades now. Like all good left-wing academic &#8220;social theories,&#8221; it would of been a shame if the neoliberal globalists didn&rsquo;t recognize their business potential. </p>

I beg to differ.  I have ONE great-great-grandmother who was an Am. Indian, too many generations ago to make any difference.  I doubt that there is any DNA left from that bloodline.  Therefore, I consider myself 100% white, thank you very much.</p>

<p>In other words, if nothing changes, 2050 will be the year the USA officially goes 3rd world. However, one cannot go by what the Census Bureau says. 2050 is a long way off and it is impossible to predict. A lot of things, such as a depression etc. could greatly alter this. If we have a serious depression and I think we will, mexicans and other 3rd worlders will stop coming and many will return home.Especially is their home countries have more jobs than we do. This could very well happen because the West has sent them our jobs, thanks to a globalized economy. If times get hard enough for whites, they could wake up(FINALLY) and start looking out for their own interests. There are too many variables to make such a prediction.</p>

<p>Oh, here we go again.  More propaganda from the Obama campaign.  Maybe the writer at the Wall Street Journal is confused about race but most Americans aren&rsquo;t.  Obama is a mixed race mongrel, and an ugly one at that, with dominant black genes. Hispanic is an ethnicity not a race.  Without knowing the race of Richardson&rsquo;s mother I couldn&rsquo;t say what he is.  If she is mestizo then he is mixed race with dominant White genes.   </p>

			<p>  In reality most people define themselves by what they appear to be. I on the other hand reject that because I realize that their are racial realities beyond the confines of our limitations of intellect, empathy, compassion, and creativity.</p>
<p>  Non racial realists are essentially just like most &#8220;Bible churches&#8221; or fundamentalist movements nowadays, just interpret it as you wish and it becomes your reality regardless of the actuality.</p>

			<p>The WSJ wants the United States to open its borders to hundreds of millions of immigrants.  It used to have editorials titled &#8220;thou shall have open borders&#8221;.  It would be easy to classify them as just mad, however, they are, in reality, neo-conservatives.  They are, or are descended from, &#8220;red-diaper babies&#8221; (old time socialist / communist families) who now call themselves &#8220;neo-conservatives&#8221;.  </p>
<p>These &#8220;neo-cons&#8221; despise the white race as much as the hard left does, and the most efficient way to eliminate the whites it is to allow the mass immigration of third world people.  So the WSJ is just engaging in wishful thinking again in this article.</p>

Hey AmReners: please read and respond. </p>
<p>The question seems to have become &#8220;who&rsquo;s white?&#8221; here on AmRen. <br>
Now I&rsquo;m curious. Please, give me your responses: then tell me what you think your lineage is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m white. My mom is probably of 50% English and 50% German stock, going back as far as we can tell (to the revolutionary period in the US). My dad&rsquo;s mom was Scots-English, and my dad&rsquo;s dad was part European: French,Italian, maybe others, and part Semitic&hellip;Arabic and/or Hebrew, who really knows? (the names and bloodlines blur between many Arabs and Hebrews).. He was a devout christian, thoroughly Western and cosmopolitan, with truly stratospheric intelligence, the highest possible education, and of a very high professional status in Europe and the USA. He was of course an American citizen.</p>
<p>My dad was raised an American, no ifs ands or buts. He is a WWII vet, and fought around the globe. He fought the Nazis, and Tojo.</p>
<p><br>
I have blue eyes and sandy brown hair, with average caucasian skin tone. I&rsquo;d have to tell you about my heritage for you to see traces of anything other than Northern European in me.</p>
<p> Just the chance play of genetics&hellip;my other siblings have black hair and brown eyes. </p>
<p>So: is such a person WHITE? If so, or not, why?</p>

			<p>Americans as I understand it follow the &#8220;one drop rule&#8221;. It&rsquo;s quite unique to the US but it&rsquo;s sure better than having every man and his dog trying to claim a racial status that is not correct.</p>

			<p>In that case, you are excluding the many Eastern Europeans who have Uralic or Turko-Mongol Asian ancestry (e.g. most Finns and Lapps, many Hungarians and Russians). And you are excluding many old-stock White Americans who have small amounts of Amerindian ancestry. Many Greeks and Italians have genetic similarities to Middle Easterners (Caucasian, but from outside Europe). <br>
Is a Finn with blond hair and epicanthic folds non-White? What about an American WASP who is 1/64 Cherokee? An Italian with Etruscan genes?<br>
Do you see the problem with the one-drop rule?<br>

			<p>&#8220;The deepest racial divide, between blacks and nonblacks, endures.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is, between blacks and everyone else.</p>
<p>But then again, the worst enemey of blacks is - of course - blacks themselves. It&rsquo;s not whites selling them drugs, killing them in the streets, etc.<br>

			<p>To 8:19PM:</p>
<p>I hope you are Welsh and your surname is Llewellyn or Lloyd or something like that, and so are your ancestors&rsquo;.  I don&rsquo;t have the source, but I&rsquo;ve read that no European can claim with certainty that he doesn&rsquo;t have a drop of Asian, Arab, etc. blood unless he is Welsh with a Welsh surname, and with only Welsh surnames in the ancestral tree.  (Britain proper had been occupied by Romans, in whose army were occasionally found Asiatics and other nonwhites from the fringes of the empire.)  </p>
<p>Somewhere long ago I had also read that the Swiss Lake Dwellers had Asian features.  Anyone know about this, and to what extent they may be the (great)**N grandfathers of us &#8220;Alpine types&#8221; here? </p>
<p>Wonder if there exist enough &#8220;White persons&#8221; by 8:19PM&rsquo;s definition to even form a viable country, anywhere. </p>

Once you mix black with white, white never looks white again.</p>
<p>Just this week, a local black radio talk show host was raving about the book, &#8220;How the Irish Became White&#8221;. He said people recommended the book and he loved it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m holding out a sliver of hope for DNA research. I&rsquo;m hoping future science will be able to untangle this mess.</p>

<p>There definitely aren&rsquo;t enough &#8220;whites&#8221; by 8:19&rsquo;s definition to form a viable movement let alone a country.  I have light brown hair, green eyes, and very pale skin.  My cousins look the same but have blue eyes.  Yet we have a native american great-grandmother, so we&rsquo;re all 1/8 Native American.</p>
<p>The one drop rule is rubbish.  If that is the standard, whites aren&rsquo;t going extinct, we already are.</p>

			<p>My own ancestry is known back to the late 1100s on the European side.  I&rsquo;m also 3/16 American Indian.  When my father told my mother, she said she would never have married him if she knew.  She didn&rsquo;t know at the time she was 1/8 Cherokee herself.</p>
<p>I have gray eyes, brown hair, a light complexion and a large nose, so I call myself &#8220;white.&#8221;  What else would I call myself?</p>

<p>You have 3.125% of her chromosomes. So you are 3.125% American Indian and about 97% Caucasian, assuming Mendelian inheritance. </p>

			<p>A lot of people are claiming to be like 1/8th or so Indian. Does anyone actually have any solid proof? It seems like for a time, this was a very fashionable thing for people to claim to be part cherokee or apache or whatever with some very dubious evidence to back it up.  </p>
<p>I remember when Ward Churchill the notorious &#8220;native american&#8221; anti american radical was revealed to be actually just plain old white, it caused a little embarassing scandal for the Cbomskyite left.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people are actually that mixed as people think. My grandparents, as is the case with most people&rsquo;s grandparents, are quite racist, and I am fairly certain I would know of any mixing in the family tree. My girlfriend likes to taunt me saying all Italians are mixed but we have blue eyes and blond highlights in our hair so I don&rsquo;t put much weight in those claims.</p>

			<p> White blood exists to some degree or another almost everywhere on the planet. Because Whites, unlike any other race have conquered, explored, built, developed civilizations unto the uttermost corners of the Earth.  They have also mixed with other populations in all of these places, so in some of them the White traits have become masked by the darker traits of those other people whom the Whites were absorbed into.<br>

			<p>My father, like most colonial descendents, was mostly Irish but part Amerind.  My mother was a Christian of German-Jewish ancestry.</p>
<p>I consider myself Caucasian; if anyone has a problem with it, that is their problem.  I actually would prefer the term Aryan, but, of course, that has an unfortunate conotation.  In any event, I consider race to be more cultural.  I am proud to be a product of Euraryan culture.</p>

			<p>  Our government, for Affirmative action purposes, considers anyone of European or Middle Eastern origin to be white. If someone has partial American Indian, Mexican or Asian ancestry, and is light skinned; he is still considered white. Governor Richardson could be considered dark white rather than Mexican. He finds it politically expedient to be Chicano. </p>

			<p>Jimmy Page, one of the greatest guitarists in the history of mankind, is one-eighth Chinese.  Does that make him &#8220;Chinese?&#8221;  He&rsquo;s English and nothing but English!!  </p>
<p>This one-drop rule is idiocy.  By that definition, almost nobody on this planet could be classified as white.</p>

			<p>It is the &#8220;gray areas&#8221; that are another factor that will put everyone and their uncle in front of white Americans. The way the system of affirmative action, quotas, and the myriad of other programs is set up now, will make it automatic, that white(European) Americans will go further down the hole of irrelevance.</p>

			<p>The real issue is perception.  If you &#8220;look white&#8221; and find that you are being held responsible for every conceivable ill in the world, without possessing any redeaming qualities whatsoever, then you are &#8220;perceived&#8221; as being &#8220;white&#8221;!</p>
<p>Perhaps that explains why individuals who are &#8220;part white&#8221; may wish to identify themselves as belonging to a minority. How ironic! There was a time when minorities would try to &#8220;pass&#8221; for being white; now we have individuals appearing white trying to &#8220;pass&#8221; for being a minority! </p>

			<p>Racial identity was pretty clear cut even 20 years ago when the vast majority of people were of European descent.  Only 60% of Americans can now claim such ancestry.  We&rsquo;ve allowed so many other groups to claim to be White including people of semitic origin and now this thing with mestizos.  Your really pushing the envelope by saying mulattos can be White.  This makes us vulnerable to ridiculous arguments that race is fluid when it isn&rsquo;t anymore than gender is.  Sure you can change your sex with an operation, cut off some parts and add others while pumping yourself with hormones.  It&rsquo;s not real though and your still biologically the same sex you were born as.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;Americans as I understand it follow the &ldquo;one drop rule&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s quite unique to the US but it&rsquo;s sure better than having every man and his dog trying to claim a racial status that is not correct&#8221;</p>
<p>Not anymore. That was back in the 1800&rsquo;s and earlier part of the 1900&rsquo;s  when it came to blacks and labeling who is black/white in mixed race people where if a person had &#8220;one drop&#8221; of black blood, they were considerd black. However, today that no longer applies in the US with official race policy. On the census, people are labeled whatever race they claim to be. As such, race can become misleading . I personally consider people with a small amount of native american etc. in their ancestry to be white. If you go back far enough and this includes Europe, you&rsquo;ll likely find small or trace amounts of non-white. As time passes, you &#8220;breed out&#8221; various characteristics as well as race. I have a friend who is a natural blond, blue eyed and very, nordic looking who has a small amount either 1/8 or 1/16th native american but would certainly consider her white. </p>

			<p>Interesting. My wife is half melanesian islander, and half white. I&rsquo;m white. Our children will be 3/4 white. I suspect people won&rsquo;t be able to pick them as having non white blood. My newphews and neices with the same mix are either very white, or tanned looking with brown hair and blue or brown eyes.</p>
<p>However, it seems some people here would refer to any of those children as non white using this &#8220;one drop&#8221; form of racial definition. It seems stupid to me - but then I&rsquo;m Australian, not American. We&rsquo;re not quite as race obsessed over here.</p>

			<p>Someone on another MB(city-data.com) once said that it is UNnatural to want to be with your own kind when it comes to mating. How the hell is that possible? Meaning, someone from Africa who sees someone who is asian thinks to themself, Gee I want to be with that because that&rsquo;s the natural thing to do. Then again, blacks are getting all the white girls. Dumb white girl race traitors. We Are Doomed! And when the liberals and the media finally figure out that obvious and glaring ray of sunshine, midnight will have already struck&hellip;.</p>

			<p> It would be great if we could all be 100% Nordic European, as most all of the early settlers/founders of this country were.<br>
  Unfortunately it is this pure old stock White group that is most to blame for dropping the ball in terms of procreating, and not mixing with Blacks and other non-White groups. They are the ones who most often embrace liberal and elitist ideals wich are railed against here and other places&hellip;and rightly so.<br>
   So if someone has a few drops of &#8220;non-White&#8221; blood, yet acts, thinks and believes in such a way that supports White interests, they should be embraced by any community identifying itself as White.</p>

			<p><i>Other minority groups are reclaiming their racial identities out of pride.</i> </p>
<p>But when a White expresses pride in his race, he is vilified as a &#8216;racist&rsquo; or &#8216;supremacist.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Most of us weren&rsquo;t that obsessed with race either when minority populations were small and few Americans had contact with them.  Now it&rsquo;s pushed in our face 24/7.  It&rsquo;s easy for someone to be judgmental of us coming from a country where minorities are less than 10% of the population.  Perhaps what Australia needs is more diversity?</p>

			<p>&#8220;A lot of people are claiming to be like 1/8th or so Indian. Does anyone actually have any solid proof? It seems like for a time, this was a very fashionable thing for people to claim to be part cherokee or apache or whatever with some very dubious evidence to back it up.&#8221; </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that is was ever &#8220;fashionable&#8221;, but it certainly was common.  Parts of my ancestry were French who happened to intermarry.  It was acknowledged simply because it was hard to ignore, if you have eyes to see. But it is no longer obvious in my generation.<br>
 I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s paper-proof out there, I have no interest to look. Typically I make no mention of it, except in a situation like this  &mdash;  where I responded to a post. <br>
I am not unique.  I think that this is a common situation among, what another poster described as &#8220;old stock&#8221; Americans  &mdash;  of which I am certainly one.</p>

			<p>The one drop rule again.</p>
<p>I am of full-blooded southern Italian descent, on both sides (Calabria). Some nordicists would consider me a(dirt+water) people. Here&rsquo;s my family profile and I&rsquo;ll let you decide.</p>
<p>Hair color: It rages from strawberry blonde to dark brown. The average would be medium brown. mostly straight but a few with moderate curls. I had one aunt who had flaming red hair and freckles, but looked italian, with blue eyes.</p>
<p>Eyes: Mostly light to medium brown with a few blues mixed in and one pair of greens.</p>
<p>Features: Mainly aquiline noses, no prominent hooks. But also some button noses in the mix. Chins and cheeks are neither too prominent or receding. </p>
<p>Skin color: light to mildy olive. The only truly swarthy member is a sicilian guy who married one of my cousins.</p>
<p>Cultural/social status: In the older generation cabinet makers (very fine work. Including my old man), masons, a tailor, a psychologist, high level execs (Renault, Massey-Ferguson, Westinghouse), a high school teacher, a literature professor who is also an expert on Jung, a bank loan officer, a  couple of salesmen and traditional housewives. In the younger generation, a physicist, an electronics engineer, a mathematician, a marine biologist, a lounge singer, an army officer (ret&rsquo;d), several business men (including myself) and a couple of cabinet makers (I could also include myself in this) and a one-time aviation technician (that´d be me, since my A&P; is valid for life). There are four WWII vets and one Vietnam vet.</p>
<p>Yet I&rsquo;ve had a run-in on these board awhile back with a nordicist who would relegate all of that to some lower shelf of &#8216;barely white&rsquo;, as if the whole history of Europe, with it&rsquo;s in-family conquests and counter-conquests, mixed royal and not so royal marriages, trade, cultural exchanges and so on, didn´t happen. So here it is again. In the middle of the greatest crisis the White race has ever known as a group, when every mind and able body counts in the fight for our survival, you have people here who would cull our ranks of all but the most &#8216;racially pure&rsquo; northern Europeans. Blindingly smart, huh?</p>
<p>I would hope we would be done with this kind of navel-gazing and leave all that to the afro centrists and the like. Knowing full well the astoundingly rich heritage of northern Europe I would have expected better than that from its some of its sons.</p>

			<p>This stupid (and very WASP) connection - nordic/white/european,it´s a insult to south Europe and forgets the Caucasian world in Western Asia and North Africa. Worst, give´s a chance to afrocentrics to make things like put Denzel Washington in the role of Hannibal!!! <br>
Thank´s to the Americans (whites and blacks) we, the Portugese, learn that the Moors, that we take for white tanned guys (and our enemies for almost 1000 years), are after all, blacks&hellip;Granada it´s full of American turists that came to see the remainings of that Great Black Civilization&hellip;And thank´s to Holliwood, everibody will believe on that. Even we&hellip;<br>

<p>So true, Mick: <br>
I think most of us know that the northeast super-whites ALWAYS had the worst of the &#8220;progressive&#8221; or ulra-liberal views, to the point of deconstructing their own society. They were the &#8220;fire-eaters&#8221;-radical abolitionists. I of course would have supported abolitionism-but these idiots were on a religious guilt-trip, and they insisted that everyone else share. I have no doubt you could trace their bloodlines-and their associations- right up to the Ivy-league-&#8220;Trustafarian&#8221; deadbeats that skulk around and shout racism, smoke pot and cash mom and dad&rsquo;s checks. Then, there&rsquo;s the neocon crowd. Is anyone whiter? Is anyone more repellent? <br>
I don&rsquo;t want these folks in the same room with me,but  I would take sides with a non-westerner who (fully) lived like a westerner and wholeheartedly supported western ideals.<br>
 <br>
There are very few, if any &#8220;pure&#8221; whites. Yes, there are people who are &#8220;more&#8221; white than others-physically and sociologically, but they don&rsquo;t lways live up to their lineage. Hence, the &#8220;trustafarians.&#8221; They, and their parents, are our worst enemies. We-White westerners -must identify with our values, but within the limits of reason, we need to allow so-called less-pure whites, and mixed race caucasians to contribute to our hopes for a new society-someday. Hell, I&rsquo;ve met Indians (east Indians) who would make outstanding contributions to a white world. Some Arabs, too. And Jews. And I like Colin Powell, Alan Keyes and Terry Anderson. A lot. I&rsquo;d have these people represent me any day, and I&rsquo;d represent them. It&rsquo;s not about skin color. It&rsquo;s how you live. Yes, genes really do matter, generalities DO apply, and make a difference, and every race should protect it&rsquo;s bloodlines from extinction or extreme dilution. But There are many non-white people who we need-as they need us.</p>
