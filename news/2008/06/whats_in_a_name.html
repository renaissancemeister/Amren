						<p>What is the most popular name for children born in the Italian city of Milan? The city&rsquo;s municipality reported what some may find a strange turn of events on the subject: The names Mahmoud, Ahmad, and Hamid are currently the most popular names given to infants born in the economic capital of Italy.</p>
<p>The Saudi newspaper al-Watan reported that the reason for the names&rsquo; newfound Italian popularity is due to the rising birthrate among the city&rsquo;s Muslim community.</p>
<p>According to al-Watan, the Milan Municipality did not overlook the figures, and directed the local media to report their concern for the issue, which is &#8220;worrying to Milan&rsquo;s society,&#8221; in order to warn against the &#8220;growth of the religion of Islam and the Muslim community, which may change the cultural characteristics of the city.&#8221;</p>

			<p>For heavens sake its because native Italian women (fertility rate 1.2) aren&rsquo;t having any babies that this situation has arisen! Muslims breed, Europeans don&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out the results!!</p>

			<p>The first thing that popped into my head, after I thought &#8220;Dear Lord, this is serious&#8221;, was this is just the city of Milan and not its surounding municipalities. Naturally there are going to be more minorities in the city because that is where they all cluster.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is disturbing. I have two married cousins who live in Milan and they both have just had their first children. After seeing this article, it gives me more incentive to convince them to make more children&hellip;and for me to catch up.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;which may change the cultural characteristics of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is most certainly a wake up call to the Italians.  There is no &#8220;may&#8221; in the above statement.  Continuing changes in the demographic make up of Italy and of Europe more generally which represent massive increases of muslims will without any doubt &#8220;change the cultural characteristics of the city&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let us all hope that the new Italian government will begin to seriously protect the future of an Italian Italy.  There are some hopeful signs.</p>

			<p>I would estimate these stats are Islamic propaganda designed to convince any unbelievers that it is useless to resist the delightful charms of &#8216;the most popular religion in the world&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Given the current nationalist climate in Italy I would hope that little Mahmoud, Ahmad &amp; Hamid become accomplished swimmers.</p>

			<p>This is indeed very serious. We are witnessing the Islamic takeover of an entire continent. And please don&rsquo;t think it won&rsquo;t happen in the United States, Canada, Australia and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Islam does not have a choice, no Muslim does, it is an imperative of their religion that each and every one of them must devote their lives to spreading Islam worldwide. Not to do so is punishable by death. They will lie to your face that this is not the case because their religion permits them to do so under their doctrine of Taquiya.</p>
<p> The only way to stop this scourge is to remove it from every Western country. At current rates Europe will be Islamic in a few decades, especially as the EU is working towards incorporating Islamic nations into their totalitarian organisation. You see in the article above how in Britain, preaching Christianity is becoming a crime, and Britain is a Constitutionally Christian nation, so what chance for the United States? Another poster points to the low birth rate of Western nations, yes that&rsquo;s another factor. At the moment we are still the majority so now is the time to act. Humane repatriation of all Muslims is the only way to deal with this, and they have only themselves to blame, they have brought it upon themselves with their aggression, hate and violence. We welcomed them as equals and they have rejected our hospitality. </p>
<p> Think about this scenario; When Islam has access to the Nuclear weapons and other arms of France and England, who might they turn their attention to? who might they threaten? There is a very real possibility that the United States will have to regard Europe as an enemy in the not too distant future. Look at the three candidates standing for president, can anyone here see any of them admitting to and standing up to the peril the world faces?  We can stop this but we need a leader, someone of note has to stand up and speak for us, because it is quite clear to me that our voices(votes) count for nothing.<br>

<p>This is brilliant, a baby race to the finish line.  But the finish line is world wide economic and ecological collapse.  Does anyone imagine that there are limits to human expansion?</p>
<p>But Italy is much further along in asserting its identity as Italian than any other country in Europe and certainly the U.S.  The trouble is that they have let it go so far that removing all the little Mohammad&rsquo;s and Mr. Wongs, and all the rest, will require a move very akin to a national ethnic/racial cleansing scheme.  Other countries of the E.U. are already raising the alarm over Italies anti-Gypsy riots.  It will be interesting to see if Italy can really do anything about it but engage in a baby race to doom.<br>

			<p>To any Milanese (and other Italians) who remain unperturbed by this development, I cordially invite you to come and inspect the formerly English cities of Birmingham, Leicester and Bradford (not to mention vast swathes of London - the largest city in Europe).</p>
<p>If you refuse to breed (and tolerate Muslims coming to your country and doing so in their customarily prolific fashion), this is YOUR future in a matter of a mere decade or so!</p>

This is a question of replacement fertility, if the white race don&rsquo;t improve their birth rate then in under a century we become extinct. SIMPLE AS!! </p>

			<p>Islam is the rapidly growing scourge in Europe, Canada, and even the redoubtable Australians.  If &#8220;liberalism is the death cult of the West,&#8221; then American shores are surely seeing it with the the growing clouds of civil war in Mexico, and gutless politicians in America.   </p>

			<p>At this rate European politicians will mandate that a dotted line be tattooed on the back of the neck of all non-Muslim newborns to be used as a reference point for the beheading of all infidels who refuse to submit to Islam&hellip;</p>

			<p>Whites have always been a global minority, just as third-world primitives have always overpopulated themselves into perpetual numeric superiority and abject poverty.</p>
<p>What has changed is that today millions of these irresponsible third-world over breeders are infesting white countries thanks to wholesale treachery on the part of Western governments.</p>
<p>Engaging third-world primitives in a breeding contest on Western soil will only lead to a struggle over our rapidly diminishing resources and a massive erosion in our standard of living.  </p>
<p>The answer lies in the deportation of these uninvited and unneeded third-world interlopers, a ban on all immigration from third-world countries, and cease all foreign aid to these countries so that war, disease and starvation will help stabilize their population as they always had before Western intervention&hellip;<br>
