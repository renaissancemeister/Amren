<h1><a href="https://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/49922">White Men Face Jobs Ban As New Law Favours Ethnic Minorities and Women</a></h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Macer Hall, Daily Express (London), June 26, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WHITE men could be blocked from jobs and promotions under a so-called equality drive unveiled by Labour today.</p>
<p>Instead women and ethnic minorities will be favoured in the workplace under a new Bill to be revealed by Equalities Minister Harriet Harman.</p>
<p>Critics blasted the measure as an unworkable piece of political correctness that will see good candidates overlooked for jobs in the interests of positive discrimination.</p>
<p>Tory MP Mark Pritchard said: &#8220;Everyone supports equal rights, but special rights cause resentment, do nothing for community cohesion and do not tackle racial prejudice. This is another example of political correctness which will not achieve an improvement in equality.&#8221;</p>
<p>And John Midgley of the Campaign Against Political Correctness said: &#8220;There is nothing positive about positive action or discrimination. It is counter-productive and potentially racist and sexist. This is typical of Harriet Harman, who must be the most politically correct MP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the new measures, firms will be able to favour the ethnic minority job applicant between two equally qualified candidates.</p>
<p>Officials insist the move is &#8220;positive action&#8221; rather than discrimination, and say they remain opposed to job quotas for women or ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Even equality campaigners attacked the measures when they were first announced in March. Katherine Rake of the Fawcett Society, an equal pay pressure group, said: &#8220;How you would really hold that up in a court of law is not clear and employers may be reluctant to use it. You are probably talking about a handful of cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the measure, companies will also be pressured into publishing clearer details of pay levels in an attempt to curb discrimination in salaries. But businesses are deeply worried about the measure undermining workforce morale and breeding more bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The Bill, which will go through Parliament in the next session, will also outlaw ageism. Ministers want to stop elderly people being patronised by doctors following complaints of pensioners being fobbed off by GPs and denied health, travel and car insurance.</p>
<p>Ms Harman said last week: &#8220;The last frontier of equality is ensuring that the growing number of older people in this country don&rsquo;t face unfair prejudice and discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is thought that the Bill will put ageism on a par with racism. The new legislation is aimed at tackling &#8220;harmful&#8221; age discrimination and will not ban systems which have benefits for the elderly, such as free bus travel.</p>
<p>Speaking at a trade union conference yesterday, Ms Harman said: &#8220;We are committed to equality and to tackling discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Equality and an absence of discrimination are the hallmarks of a modern society and a strong economy which can draw on the talents of all.&#8221;<br>

Equality and an absence of discrimination are the hallmarks of a modern society and a strong economy which can draw on the talents of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
It never fails to amaze me that these politically correct airheads can say things such as this with a straight face. Do these people really believe that discriminating against white males is the equilivent of &#8220;an absence of discrimination&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Ms Harman is wrong. The last frontier of equality is to stop the war on straight white men. But, she would rather take the Zimbabwe approach and just expel them all from the country to move closer to her diverse society.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Equality and an absence of discrimination are the hallmarks of a modern society and a strong economy which can draw on the talents of all.&rdquo; Per the abjectly insane and utterly abominable ravings of Comrade Harman above.</p>
<p>Indeed, unless discrimination and an absence of equality are afforded to white men in these socioeconomic hallmarks of modernity!</p>
<p>Personally, for the long term sociopolitical betterment of the UK, I hope this filthy Marxist bill is passed with overwhelming Labour (and even some Tory) support. Normally, I am somewhat measured and forbearing about such political actions in any white country, but not this time; this time, I applaud and encourage this outright idiocy of all the multicultural swine on both the right and left in the UK!</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>This would be because the UK is still about somewhere between 91% to 88% white, and they would only be getting a mild taste of what there future holds in the &ldquo;coming&rdquo; Utopian Kingdom with a nonwhite majority, while they can still redress the issue politically and with minimal need for force. Or put another way, it allows the average white Briton (regardless of: sex, age, or race) to evaluate the current corrupt and bankrupt state of their political &ldquo;establishment,&rdquo; and replace it with the BNP.</p>
<p>Sometimes worse is better, and here we have a case in point; let the BNP see 50 or 100 white votes come their way, for every 0.5 to 1.0 nonwhite votes the multicultural crowd gets because of this vicious anti-white man measure.</p>
<p>Or out another way again, God let it be so!</p>

			<p>As a woman, I would NEVER want a job set aside for me because I&rsquo;m a woman or to be given affirmative action. First of all, I find affirmative action insulting. It insinuates that one is less capable or intelligent in my book. I don&rsquo;t need it, I&rsquo;m perfectly capable of getting jobs based on my merits. Secondly, nobody else would respect you or take you seriously. All I want is the same thing everyone else wants, a fair chance to compete and job if I&rsquo;m qualified for it.  </p>

			<p>The Labour Party is, without question, the most evil and dangerous threat - internal or external - that the indigenous peoples of these islands have ever faced. </p>
<p>To fully list their crimes against our indigenous peoples and their way of life would take too long and would, quite frankly, be too stressful for me, but this latest outrage needs to be addressed. </p>
<p>Be under no illusions, what their latest scheme means is this: the ONLY group in the UK which can be legally discriminated are white males. Indeed, such discrimination is not merely legal (by, for example, some loophole in the legislation) but is actively encouraged by government design.</p>
<p>To my fellow countrymen and women: vote BNP or face oblivion.    </p>

			<p>If i were British I would vote for the BNP. At least you Brits have some hope of actually electing a party that is in line with white goals where we in the U.S. are busy giving our property, our rights and our freedoms to the Muslims and black would be oppressors. I ask again, has anyone ever read a paper back Sci-Fi book titled &#8220;Farnham&rsquo;s Freehold&#8221;?<br>

			<p>NEW PLEASURE LAWS FOR MINORITIES</p>
<p>Since you feel you have the legal and moral right to take from white males their livelihood, this white male thinks we should change the laws in England to require liberal white females (and males) to have sex with any and every non-white male that currently resides in England and desires such. I&rsquo;ll bet such a bill would pass with overwhelming support of the minority community. How about it, Mrs. Harman? Just how inclusive and tolerant are you? What are you willing to give up?</p>

<p>There is no discrimination in pay levels!  It is always equal pay for equal roles!</p>
<p>A female engineer gets paid exactly the same as a male engineer!<br>
A female lawyer gets paid exactly the same as a male lawyer!<br>
A female teacher gets paid exactly the same as a male teacher!</p>
<p>As a group average, women recieve less salary than men.  This is an insultingly simple statement.  According to equality dogma, implying that women prefer less demanding jobs and take time off to raise a family are irrelevant!  Men consistently work the jobs with the longest hours that involve the most travel, as well as a near 100% of the unseen backbreaking tasks in terrible conditions that society is reliant on.</p>
<p>There was an article I read recently where airline stewardesses sued because they were being paid less than the airline pilots.  No, you can&rsquo;t make this stuff up.</p>

			<p>England&rsquo;s survival depends on its raising up a young Enoch Powell and electing him as Prime Minister.  There is simply no other way.  The Diversity multicultural thought police will win otherwise. </p>
<p>In an earlier era, the King would have imprisoned or even beheaded Harriet Harman.  Remove her from office at once. </p>

			<p>The fact is that the bureaucracy in most UK government depts. (probably the only people who will actually make an effort in enforcing this law), is already predominately female - will they be sanctioned in making their workplaces even more female dominated?<br>
 Secondly, the British government has given an extraordinary right of privelege to a non-White who has just arrived on British shores a yera ago (perhaps he or in this case she couldn&rsquo;t even locate Britain on a map a few years back), against the &#8216;rights&rsquo; of native indigenous Britons, whose ancestry can be traced back at least 8000 years on the island! - Compare and contrast this with the &#8216;right of return&rsquo; anyone who can prove a smidgen of German blood gets to access german citizenship!<br>
  The New Labur Governmemt is the most worthless, useless, clueless wrteched curse ever to afflict the British people.<br>

			<p>Ms Harman calls the policy &#8220;positive action.&#8221;  Of course, this is just like America&rsquo;s &#8220;affirmative action.&#8221;  What she omits is that for every instance of &#8220;positive action&#8221; in favor of a less qualified minority or female candidate, there will be NEGATIVE action to deny equal opportunity to a better qualified white male.  Her argument avoids preference by stating the minority will be selected if the qualifications are equal.  This lie was often expounded in the early 1960s in the US.  The way the ideologues got around this was to attack real qualifications where intelligence was required.  Simply make the tests and qualifications so easy that even most minorities can be deemed qualified (along with almost all white males).  The human resources department will then select the minority applicant, even though on a real test of qualifications, that same person would probably fail.  Eleanor Holmes Norton did everything to prevent real testing for jobs in the US because she knew most minority applicants could not pass them.  Ms Harman is not only at war with white males, she is at war with intelligence, and with real qualifications for most jobs.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  Hugh M</p>

<p><br>
It&rsquo;s not that women prefer less demanding jobs but the fact that many already have the demanding job of raising kids means  they don&rsquo;t have time for demanding jobs with a lot of travel. Both the backbreaking tasks of men as well as the raising of the kids by women are both important to society. I am a woman and as someone else on here said, I don&rsquo;t need affirmative action. I graduated from college with a mostly A-average. Sorry, don&rsquo;t need it.</p>

<p>Just another brilliant scheme by self-appointed elitist multicults who feel they have the right to invoke more of their kooky ideas, because everything they&rsquo;re promoted up to date has been such a success.</p>
<p>Riots are not uncommon, and because of bombings by home-grown terrorists, originating from the third world, their groups and mosques have to be constantly monitored to try to head off any of a number of attacks in the planning stages right now.  Preaching hate is commonplace, and many openly declare they won&rsquo;t rest until the UK is under their control.  These third worlders and other non-whites, mostly blacks, have inundated the court and prison systems, and all of them draw heavily from the public trough.  Social payouts and additional security has to be a huge crush on the budget in times when the economy is heading downward.</p>
<p>And their answer to alleviating the hovoc wrought on society by their incompetence?  More kooky ideas.  This time they&rsquo;re concentrating heavily on assuring that third worlders are promoted, as if such nonsense should be given top priority over correcting all the problems they&rsquo;ve caused to begin with.</p>

			<p>I often wonder WHY Britain ever bothered to fight the two world wars. I really, really do. I can&rsquo;t think of how Britain gained anything at all from any of it. Britain basically spent the first half of the 20th century grappling with Germany a country ethnically close to itself, two unnecessary wars, only to throw away its &#8220;VICTORY&#8221; by basically destroying itself with the Labour party, socialism and mass immigration of overseas foreigners. This is the U.K. so many soldiers went over the top for on July 1 1916? This is the England those brave RAF fighter pilots gave so much for in 1940? This is the Britain the men of the Eighth army sweltered in the desert heat for? There are places today in the U.K. a war veteran couldn&rsquo;t dare go to walk around in. Do you think Japanese WW2 veterans have that problem? I wonder if those British vets HAD ONLY KNOWN this was the country they were going to end up with after all their sacrificing for, if they would even have bothered? In my opinion Germany is better off then Britain today in almost every possible way. An excellent account of the foolishness of Britain&rsquo;s German wars is provided in Patrick Buchanan&rsquo;s latest book. Why any native Briton would vote for the Labour party - the architect of this nightmare - is just beyond me. </p>
