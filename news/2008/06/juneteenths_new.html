						<p>The Juneteenth Festival drew a smaller crowd to Martin Luther King Park on Sunday, but still entertained festival-goers with a variety of events and activities celebrating African-American heritage and culture.</p>
<p>Saturday&rsquo;s crowd was estimated at more than 40,000, while Sunday brought in about half of that number.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brown explained that attendance on Sundays usually goes down because there&rsquo;s no parade like there is on Saturday. The parade is the most popular event each year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a community parade. Everybody gets involved in it,&#8221; Brown said.</p>
<p>In addition to traditional events like the parade, this year&rsquo;s festival included a re-enactment of a slave auction that took place throughout the two days. The actors stayed in character after the performance to answer questions from the crowd.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also new this year was a two-hour African drum and dance event that included an hourlong class on African drums and another hour on dance. Brown said the event was very well attended.</p>
<p>The Museum of Science held an exhibit of William West&rsquo;s art, provided by El Museo.</p>
<p>West is a Buffalo native who displayed about 30 pieces of art made between 1951 and the present. Pieces included watercolor paintings and pen-and-ink drawings.</p>

			<p>There were some black slaveowners. Do you think Juneteenth will feature some of them? Someone has written a book about them. See<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Slaveowners-Masters-Carolina-1790-1860/dp/1570030375/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=12136" rel="nofollow">this book.</a></p>

			<p>When they have the reenactment of the slave auction, I wonder what goes through the contempoary blacks head when they are told that one of the things at the slave auction was that the occupation of the slave was a selling point. Such as if he/she was a carpenter, mason, shoemaker, field hand, maid, cook, coachman, etc., etc, etc.</p>
<p>If they do bring these up, blacks today must be astonished that their forebares were actually useful people, unlike themselves.</p>

			<p>Last year, there were a couple shootings so they shut down early. That probably explains why the crowds were smaller this year.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The re-enacting stage was beautiful. We have to improve on something like that,&rdquo; Brown said.</i></p>
<p>People who are stuck in the past can&rsquo;t move into the future. It&rsquo;s one thing to remember the past. It&rsquo;s another thing to pick at and reopen wounds.</p>

			<p>Since when does a museum of SCIENCE display ART??? All the inventions made by Whites since 1951, and all they can come up with is 30 pieces of junk-opps-&#8220;art&#8221; by some unknown &#8220;artist?&#8221; This would be funny if it wasn&rsquo;t so sad! I hope next year they will have a re-enactment of the thousands of Whites that have been assaulted and killed by them in the last 40 years, with the White liberals that attended this &#8220;event&#8221; playing the victims!!!!</p>

			<p>&#8220;a two hour African drum and dance event&#8221; Finally something that might bore me more than golf!! Talk about wandering off toward the bathrooms and the soda booth.  As to slave auctions, they forever will remind me of  15-17 year old blonde girls in cut-offs being &#8220;sold&#8221; to pay for cheerleader camp. </p>

			<p>If slavery is such a painful collective memory, why would they want to reenact a slave auction of all things?  Also, you can imagine the uproar that would result if some primarily white organization would sponsor such a reenactment.</p>

<p>It is this constant dwelling on victimization that makes for the black attitude, and it is the black attitude more than the black lack of intelligence and ability that keeps him in last place among all the races of the earth. </p>
<p>And it is the encouragement of this victimization by the Jeremiah Wrights that has been responsible for anti-white, black hate.</p>
<p>If whites had the same history as blacks, I&rsquo;d be ashamed to re-enact the history in any aspect, because to do would highlight over and over again that a people surely were stupid to have been taken advantage of so easily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want to forget about it and look to the future. Blacks cannot do this.  They must feel as if they are victims, because to fail to do that means they would be forced to recognize the truth that they are incompetent, and they are far too arrogant to admit that.</p>

			<p>What a joke!  What exactly is African American heritage?  A race noted for its low IQ, tribalism and violence sells its own people or those of other tribes into slavery.  They are then transported to an advanced white country where they serve as slaves for several centuries until the whites free them.  They are descended from the one racial group which has by far contributed the least to anything of value in the world of all the races on earth and which was at the time of their enslavement and still remains in many areas at the level of development of the stone age. What, prey tell, is there to celebrate about such a &#8220;culture&#8221;?</p>

			<p>If a White had reenacted a slave auction it would be called racist.</p>
<p>I wonder if their little play will include the Black Africans who sold Black Africans into slavery.</p>

			<p> The Juneteenth celebration have frequently degenerated into violence and mayhem mostly against whites. As a white person, I would avoid being anywhere close to these celebrations. </p>

&#8220;&hellip;a two-hour African drum and dance event&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
African drumming: a bunch of people randomly smacking stretched animal skins with their palms, with no prescribed beat or rhythm, and with no clear objective other than kicking up an intimidating racket. Contrast this with the precision and artistry of white percussionists like Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, or Keith Moon. </p>
<p>African dancing: a bunch of people randomly jumping around and flailing their body parts, with no prescribed beat or rhythm, and with no clear objective other than to incite sexual activity (or perhaps to tenderize the missionary meat before cooking). In terms of discipline and athleticism, not exactly the Bolshoi Ballet, or even the Rockettes. </p>
<p>TWO HOURS of this stuff? I couldn&rsquo;t sit through five minutes. <br>

			<p>When I was a freshman, I was harassed by upperclassmen in high school.  It was traumatic and not much fun.  Somehow, I got over it.  Years go by without me thinking about something that happened 20 years ago.  If I couldn&rsquo;t get over it, and chose instead to revisit the experience every day, and stage annual reenactments of jocks stuffing me in a locker and such, I wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten very far as an adult.  Yet blacks can&rsquo;t get over things that happened, not to them but somebody else, at least 145 years ago!  Absurd.  </p>

<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t &#8216;getting over&rsquo; anything. They are busy stuffing you in a locker, even as they play being victim. That was a great comment about, wonder how it would go over if a white organization were to do this same slavery-reenactment?. </p>

			<p>If blacks hadn&rsquo;t used each other as a form of currency back in Africa we wouldn&rsquo;t have many of the problems we suffer today. The slave trade was invented in Africa where it still goes on to this day.  Before they were able to unload their retarded population by selling them into slavery they ate them. <br>

<p>My favorite are the black boys in Chicago that beat on 5-gallon plastic paint pails while asking for money. They can&rsquo;t even take the effort to create steel drums from 55-gallon containers! At least that would show some semblance of creativity.</p>

<p>Years ago, I had a black guy say to me on a job that I was a slave driver. I told him that if he were the slave and i was the master, I&rsquo;d have to go out and get a job to support us both for all the good he was doing.</p>
<p>Same with your idea that you need a cook and a gardener. You might not be a good cook or a good gardener, but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re better than any of these contemporary blacks with your eyes closed. Better to do anything yourself than watch these poor people pretend to work.</p>

			<p>To Right-Wing Rocker:</p>
<p>Sorry but I have to disagree with your statements on African drumming.  Ever study Cuban salsa or mambo?  There&rsquo;s a basic fundamental rhythm (the &#8220;clave&#8221;), and beneath that, several layers of contrasting counter-rhythms, each played on a different timbre of drum or percussion.  The different patterns don&rsquo;t seem related, but amazingly, they all come together to produce a nice, balanced flow of sound.  Try designing something like this from scratch!  The Ghanaian drum music is constructed very similarly, which makes sense, given that it is the source of the Cuban percussion patterns.  In either case it requires a very fine sense of precision in timing.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that *all* African drumming has this level of complexity  &mdash;  perhaps there are Africans who just stupidly slap drums any which way and don&rsquo;t exhibit any further musical talent.</p>
<p>However, I do have to agree with you about African *dance*.  I&rsquo;ve<br>
been at &#8220;concerts&#8221; of both Ghanaian dance and Puerto Rican bomba, and they seemed mainly to be sticking their large rear ends up in  the air and shaking them.  <br>

			<p>What&rsquo;s this doing in Buffalo?  Juneteenth never had ANYTHING to do with Buffalo.  </p>
<p>Nor, until recently, were there any blacks (beyond a minuscule number)  in that city or in that  entire part of the state or  country. I should know; I was raised there.</p>
<p>This is just another rabble-rousing black race hustler, peddling white guilt and looking for sympathy (read &#8220;reparations&#8221;).  If he wanted to be historically accurate, he could reenact an anti-slavery rally of abolitionists,  or a contingent of Union soldiers marching off to fight (and die) at Gettysburg.</p>
