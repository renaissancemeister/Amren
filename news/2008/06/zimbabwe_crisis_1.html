						<p>A white farming couple was assaulted, whipped and shot at after they were given two minutes to leave their property in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>William Rogers and his wife, Annette, were threatened by three Robert Mugabe supporters, who told them: &#8220;We are like hungry lions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dozens of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s last white farmers have suffered similar ordeals since Mr Mugabe lost the presidential election&rsquo;s first round in March. Scores of black opposition supporters have been murdered and thousands beaten, abducted or tortured.</p>
<p>After defying the two-minute warning to leave, Mr and Mrs Rogers took refuge in their home on Chigwell farm. A gang of a dozen men soon gathered outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;They started smashing windows and the front door was smashed open,&#8221; said Mr Rogers. One of the men produced a gun and opened fire. &#8220;He fired a shot directly at us which went just over my head and close to my wife&rsquo;s head,&#8221; said Mr Rogers. &#8220;He obviously intended to kill us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The couple retreated upstairs and listened, terrified, as the gang began heaping together a fire in their living room, using the wreckage of their back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought we would be burnt alive, which is when I said that we would come out,&#8221; said Mr Rogers. He grabbed a shotgun and led his wife downstairs. The ringleader ordered him to hand over his weapon. Men seized Mrs Rogers and grabbed her by the throat.</p>
<p>Then the mob set upon both the farmer and his wife with sticks and pipes. &#8220;They dragged my wife outside and they were trying to strangle her,&#8221; said Mr Rogers. &#8220;She managed to bite the hand of the man who was grabbing her round the throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;He started to beat her. At one time, there were at least four men beating and kicking her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bruised and bleeding, the couple were tied up and hurled into the back of a pickup. Finally, at least five hours after the first calls for help, the local police responded. Four armed officers freed Mr and Mrs Rogers, who were taken to Harare, the capital, for emergency treatment. They are now recovering.</p>

			<p>&#8220;began heaping together a fire in the living room&hellip;&#8221;  Must have been a terrifying moment. That is, I believe,  the scariest image I have ever pondered. The previous one was the scene in Mysterious Island where the giant bee starts sealing up the guy and girl  with wax in the honey comb to eat later. I  wonder if the man in the article thought of that also at the moment. <br>

Its too bad the California &#8220;educational&#8221; establishment who did every trick in the book to end White rule in southern Africa can&rsquo;t be sent there to suffer the reward of their efforts. </p>
<p>Of course, looking to California&rsquo;s future, they may not need to leave home.</p>

			<p>  Seeing as it was peanutman carter who lead the U.S. and the world in putting pressure on Rhodesia and South Africa to allow black-rule on those countries; I truly believe it should be the responsibility of those western nations to foot the bill for ALL whites in the affected african countries to relocate to the western nations. Once again, we can see why the rest of the world literally hates the west, especially the United States. What part of NO FOREIGN ENTANGLEMENTS did we not understand? I am truly beginning to have serious ill-feelings toward this country myself.</p>

			<p>Why are white people still in the former Rhodesia anyway?  Any white people left in East St. Louis, Illinois or Gary, Indiana would suffer the same fate.  Please come to the United States.  We could use all the white people we can get.</p>

			<p>We in the US let our government destroy the civilized white governments in Rhodesia and South Africa so we bear some responsibility in this ongoing tragedy.   It makes me want to spit on the celebs who think that calling for intervention in Darfor is the height of compassion.   It makes me despise the media who never make even the slightest mention of this genocide against whites.</p>
<p>How long do you think it will be before the animals in this country feel emboldened enough to start attacking whites like this in the USA?  Oh yeah, how could I forget. They have been attacking, raping, murdering and stealing from whites in American for thirty long years during which our police, government leaders, business leaders and media have colluded in the violence against white people by covering up the actual number of attacks and trying to confuse the issue by failing to disclose the race of victims and their criminal attackers.</p>
<p>How many of you who happen to live near blacks actually think that if the conditions were right they wouldn&rsquo;t pull you out of your house or car and beat you like these people were beaten?  I know that if you have ever lived in a lower middle class or working class neighborhood with a large number of blacks that you know the answer to this question already.    We have seen how the police in every major US city start to freak out every time the lights go out in large metro areas as they nervously pray that the problem gets resolved before the sun goes down.  Can you imagine that?  I remember hearing TV news people worrying about the same thing on national news.</p>
<p>I never would have imagined the things that I have seen and heard in the last ten years.  I have a three teenage children who think that I am exaggerating when I tell them that this isn&rsquo;t the country or world that I was born into.  They think that America and the world has always been like this.  We hear the least about the worst attacks on whites like the torture/rape/murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome while there in endless 24/7 coverage on bogus &#8220;crimes&#8221; like the false rape charge against the Duke college students or the ridiculous glorification of the Jenna 6.  I still don&rsquo;t understand how six thugs who beat a white kid into the ground could end up being lionized by blacks and their white liberal facilitators as &#8220;civil rights&#8221; heroes.</p>
<p>I can only hope that as the minorities in this country continue to become more and more confident that they can attack whites with little risk that they will go to far and the sleeping whites will finally wake up and begin to fight back to defend themselves, their children and their country.  We can&rsquo;t afford to loose this coming struggle as there is nowhere left to go.  If America is not maintained as a safe place for white civilization where else do you think will be safe?  Stand up now while we still have the numbers and the political power.</p>

			<p>For a western nation to take Whites as refugees from a Black run nation would be tantamount to admitting that life under Blacks is intolerable. This can never be said because after all, they have been telling White people for decades that &#8216;they&rsquo;re just like us&hellip;&#8221;. This is the Left&rsquo;s justification for bringing millions of non-Whites into our nations to live amongst us. They cannot admit to bringing in evil. They cannot be wrong. So we must just live with it. But in any case, once life in our enriched and diverse nations becomes too chaotic and law and order breaks down,as in Zim &amp; SA, then our benevolent Marxist rulers will be able to justify dictatorial rule. (For our own protection don&rsquo;t you know).<br>

<p>But while we may have the numbers the numbers are close to zero in terms of sense of responsibility.  There are by some accounts 35 to 60 million whites on anti depresant, anti psychotic drugs.<br>
These male/females are only interested in feeling good and the concept of responsibility interferes with feeling good.  They will continue to sit on the sofa.</p>
<p>The non whites hate us so completely that they are happy to drink ditch water as long as whitey is dead.  The soldiers of the military industrial complex will help them by cutting down any resistance those calling themselves white Americans might offer.</p>
<p>There will be no renaissance in America, our future, fully exposed by the crowds around Obama, demonstrates that it will become the camp of the saints.  </p>

<p>With the example of Jews who remained in Germany after 1936 available, it is simply mind-boggling that some whites have not yet left Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>Exactly!!!  Can you imagine what Jesse and Al would have to say if the US were to start saving white people?  Nothing shows more clearly the white self-hatred that is de rigeur among America&rsquo;s fashionable liberals than our unwillingness to throw a life preserver to these decent, productive people.  </p>
<p>Some people still complain that FDR showed callous disregard toward Europe&rsquo;s Jews in the &#8216;30&rsquo;s. But the situation in Zimbabwe is not history; those people can be saved.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know how hard it would be for African whites to immigrate to the US (although I&rsquo;ve met quite a few ex-South African Jews in the US), but there&rsquo;s a fair number of ex-Rhodesians in New Zealand and Australia so they do have options.  </p>

			<p>I predict this will become rampant during King Hussein&rsquo;s rein, and if whites fight back the government will disarm them. Kiss your first and second ammendment rights goodbye forever. Those who think barrio boy is less a threat than either of the other two loosers, have lost their ability to think. Ps I fear AMREN will be silenced, by his neo nazi marxist regime.  </p>

<p>This is the issue whites in the western world need to pay attention to before we consider offering these people a method of escape.</p>
<p>They are victims.  But they are also race traitors.  They KNOW, better than anyone else what is going on there.  Yet, they choose to stay.  More to the point, they stay so that they can feed the enemy.  An enemy that should starve to death as just punishment for their evil.  And they are&hellip;.evil that is.  And they mean whites harm.  To feed them.  To support the crumbling economy in Zimbabwe, in any manner, by specifically doing those things that whites can and blacks cannot&hellip;.is wrong.  And that sin has a very specific punishment&hellip;.death.</p>
<p>This couple was lucky&hellip;.undeservedly so.  Whites in africa should be organizing and ethnically cleansing blacks from an area so that whites can both live in peace and reap the benefits of their labors.

Whites in africa should be organizing and ethnically cleansing blacks from an area so that whites can both live in peace and reap the benefits of their labors.

<p>&gt; I think you are wrong and here is why;  I heard a radio interview some time back with white farmers in Zim.  What they said was that all the whites who were young enough or had somewhere to go had left.  They remained because everything they had was in Zim and they had no one to go to - or money to go.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be so harsh on whites.  They may indeed be Liberals - at one time.  The white South Africans I have met over the years were very clearly not liberal, but understood the reasons for apartied.  </p>

<p>Posted by Michael C. Scott at 1:27 PM on June 7 </p>
<p>I am guessing you mean that since those Jews were not allowed to leave that white Zims may soon find no exit?</p>
<p>But as I have already posted, I heard a radio interview with a white Zim couple who said that all the young whites had long left.  They had nowhere to go and everything they still had were in Zim.  I understand the same regarding South African farmers too.</p>

			<p>Wow. And I thought the mult-cultis made me feel guilty with their fantasies. Are you all telling me that by destroying the governments of South Africa and Zimbabwe, we may well cause the starvation of tens of millions of black Africans. Starvation is a horrible, horrible way to die. Now I feel even worse.</p>

			<p>So let me get this, they are starving so they kill all their food producers and then our western countries feed them in the form of aid.<br>
Why don&rsquo;t we just cut out the middle man and just shoot the farmers ourselves(Western countries that is).<br>
australia and the Uk have just pledged a multi million dollars aid commitment to Zim, while it&rsquo;s leader tells the world how its our fault they&rsquo;re failing.<br>
It&rsquo;s actually comical (except if you&rsquo;re the white farmers).</p>

<p><br>
Consider this.  Blacks in africa have an average IQ that is lower than institutionalized retarded persons.  They developed NONE of the hallmarks of industrialization, modern government or even civilization, on their own.  There are no weapons factories in africa.  And now that whites are mostly displaced from Zimbabwe, the population lives on the very edge of starvation.  Only foreign (mostly US) food aid keeps these people from being wiped out&hellip;.tomorrow.</p>
<p>As racial enemies go, these people are pathetic.  Genetic rejects with no ability whatsoever to survive, let alone compete with others.</p>
<p>So how did they manage to become such a problem for africa&rsquo;s white population?  Treason.  Race traitors enable them at every turn.  For years and years, whites attempted to stop this from happening but were stabbed in the back by their neighbors who thought it more important to hold to disgusting liberal values, rather than do what everyone knew was necessary&hellip;.just as long as it wasn&rsquo;t them being victimized this time.</p>
<p>Well, now everyone else is either dead, fled or forcibly ejected from Zimbabwe.  Since there is no one else, it was this couple&rsquo;s turn.  The last holdouts that refused to stand with their neighbors years ago when Rhodesian whites were still strong.  These people are not the victims.  They are the victimizers, now hoisted by their own petard.</p>
<p>If I sound harsh, it&rsquo;s only because it is happening here, now, today&hellip;in OUR country.  Something needs to be done but it isn&rsquo;t being done because people like this will not stand together in solidarity.  Our people are being raped, robbed, murdered and beaten, every day, in large numbers.  But people like this couple can&rsquo;t be bothered to help&hellip;..just as long as they aren&rsquo;t the ones being victimized this time.  Instead, they smile, vote for Obama&hellip;..and call people like me racist for daring to point out what is going on.</p>

<p>Sorry, but I disagree. Though it&rsquo;s popular to wrongly blame the USA for the sins of the world,  the  country responsible for this mayhem is South Africa. It was South Africa that voted for black rule, including leftist whites there. Now marxists/socialists in the USA, Europe, Canada and other nations did undermine whites and I do agree that people who were not South Africans should have stayed out of South Africa&rsquo;s affairs. As far as our day coming, I&rsquo;m afraid it arrived years ago. </p>

<p>This is wrong. These people are simply trying to survive the way they always have, through farming. These white people have lived there all of their lives and it&rsquo;s difficult, especially when you are older, to leave everything behind, when you still have family and/or have little money, and move abroad and start over with nothing. Especially when most nations will give them a hard time about getting in. Whites in other countries should be giving these people all the help they need.</p>

<p>It is truly astounding how courageous the white Rhodesians and South Africans are.  They remind me of how Americans were in the 1800s when we had a frontier and Indians would attack.  These African whites are the way we used to be.</p>
<p>I wish we at Amren could help them!  I read once that South Africa shuts down any charity that is specifically for whites, but there must be something we can do.  If someone knows, please tell us.</p>

			<p>It wasn&rsquo;t economic boycotts by the rest of the world, including the US that led South Africa to its current state, so don&rsquo;t blame us.  The boycotts resulted in a South Africa that produced nearly all of its own military hardware, and which could refurbish and modernize what had been imported ealier (such as the remanufacture of elderly Mirage III jets into the Atlas Cheetah).  It resulted in a South Africa that ran on synthetic gasoline.</p>
<p>Why did South Africa allow the infamous elections that resulted in the Marxist ANC takeover and the subsequent slide downhill?  Sports boycotts.  South Africans who would give up their country for the sake of watching sport on telly ought not to blame the United States too harshly.</p>

			<p>Sickens me, but a part of me is wishing they had left long ago, and destroyed their farm before doing so, to make sure none of these dirty thugs were able to benefit from the fruits of their labor. In the long run these all of these land stealers look like nothing more than lazy incompetant idiots, since they are never able to maintain the land. Every one of those stolen farms have become barren since being overtaken by Blacks, who know about as much about farming, as they would rocket science. </p>

<p>This is precisely what worries me about Europe. If The BNP ever were elected to Parliament and tried to remove the 3rd worlders from Britain just how would the US react? and what if ALL European nations decided to expel their immigrants,non whites and esp. Muslims? would the US sit by and watch this &#8216;ethnic cleansing&rsquo; as the Middle East, Africa and millions of non-whites and Muslims in America, all howled down the evil racist Europeans. Just as you said, the US as the superpower did all it could to enable Blacks to take over in Africa; but what you must bear in mind is that since the 1950&rsquo;s Marxism has been taking root in the United States, there is no way they could have left Whites in power in S.Africa or Zim, nor do I believe they will permit Europe to return to a homogenous state. esp. as we seem to be hell bent on electing a mixed race (Black/Arab/White) Marxist president this November.<br>

Get them over here on student visas and let them enroll in a community college at least and live with someone sympathetic who will help them learn a trade.  It will be tough on the men but at least they can rest easy knowing the women are safe.  Will any churches or women&rsquo;s rights groups get involved?
