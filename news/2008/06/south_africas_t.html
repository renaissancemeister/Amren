<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A court on Thursday ordered the nation&rsquo;s top cop to stand trial on corruption charges next year, widening a leadership vacuum in law enforcement agencies struggling to control one of the world&rsquo;s highest crime rates.</p>
<p>Jackie Selebi is accused of accepting bribes from a businessman who was convicted of drug smuggling and of trying to shield him from prosecution. Selebi has been on a leave of absence from the police commissioner post since he was charged last February, when he also quit as president of Interpol.</p>
<p>The head of the National Prosecuting Authority is also suspended as part of a bitter turf war against the police, and tensions within the police led to an armed standoff in downtown Johannesburg late Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that Glen Agliotti gave Selebi cash handouts whenever he demanded. In return, the prosecuting authority said, Selebi turned a blind eye to Agliotti&rsquo;s involvement in transporting large quantities of illegal drugs, and tipped him off that British investigators were on his trail. Selebi has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>South Africa is notorious for its rampant crime, with more than 50 murders per day and the highest reported rape rate in the world. Yearly crime statistics to be released next Monday will reveal whether the government has made any headway in tackling the violence which may deter many fans from the 2010 World Cup.</p>

			<p>&#8220;South Africa is notorious for its rampant crime, with more than 50 murders per day and the highest reported rape rate in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>What they should do there is to go into black logic mode, like Marion Barry, the ex-D.C. mayor who tried to justify his high crime rate in D.C. by using black Logic:  &#8220;They say that D.C. has a high crime rate, but if you throw out the murders, the crime rate is very, very low.&#8221; </p>

			<p>And this man, although he is not a trained policeman but merely an ex-terrorist political appointee, was the President of Interpol, the international police organisation for several years.</p>
<p>You can fool some of the people&hellip;&hellip;.  In this case you really can fool all of them almost all of the time.</p>
<p>Also needed is similar justice for the ANC appointed ex-terrorist police chief who killed many and maimed others by planting a bomb in a bar full of whites in Durban, South Africa about 18 years ago.  Over a year ago he was charged with driving drunk and having an accident where his State vehicle was written off. Made love to a tree.  The tree won. Robert McBride is his name; another &#8220;hero&#8221; of the revolution!   It has been reported that on-the-spot witnesses have received death threats.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love the excitement of it all?</p>

			<p>Police work: the responsibility to look after your community and keep an eye on the troublemakers, or the opportunity to make a quick buck?</p>
<p>If we needed another example of why police are universally loathed throughout the third world, this is it.</p>
