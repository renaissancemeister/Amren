<p>Rather than being a one-time incident, the Irish plebiscite, which defeated the treaty 53.4 percent to 46.6 percent, is the latest evidence that nationalism is alive and kicking in Europe, regardless of repeated attempts by the continent&rsquo;s elites to turn the European Union into an enhanced political body, designed to play a bigger role in world affairs.</p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s citizens favor the free movement of goods, capital and, to a somewhat lesser extent, people throughout the 27- country union. They don&rsquo;t, though, want to surrender their legal traditions, change their tax structures or alter other parts of their national identity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All 27 EU members must ratify the Lisbon Treaty for it to be adopted. Therefore, Ireland&rsquo;s rejection should kill it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The goal of the Lisbon Treaty is to improve the operating efficiency of the EU. It calls for a semi-permanent, unelected presidency to replace the current system in which individual governments head the union on a six-month rotating basis. The treaty also includes an expanded foreign-policy and defense apparatus, and calls for more decisions to be made by weighted- majority vote, instead of the requirement for unanimity that generally prevails.</p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s leaders have only themselves to blame for the political logjam. The Lisbon Treaty is a dense 277-page document of legal gobbledygook. No &#8220;sane person&#8221; would read it, Charlie McCreevy, Ireland&rsquo;s current EU commissioner, said in late May.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if European leaders succeed in ameliorating Irish sensitivities, the divide between the union&rsquo;s citizenry and its politicians won&rsquo;t go away. That&rsquo;s because the ordinary folk don&rsquo;t want to surrender their heritage to a central, largely unelected authority comprised of European bureaucrats.</p>

			<p>The Irish were the only people even allowed to vote among the 27 nations that this treaty would have covered.</p>
<p>Yeah, unelected presidents, sounds great.  Thank god they let the Irish vote.</p>

Of course not!  What sane or free people would?   The fact that the treaty passed in all those other countries is because they weren&rsquo;t ALLOWED to vote on it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ordinary Europeans don&rsquo;t want to lose their heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>What they want doesn&rsquo;t matter.  What they&rsquo;re going to get is a multicultural society that will erase their traditions and history, so they had better shut up or they will have to go to the &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; room, where their minds will be made more amenable to the new world order.</p>
<p>They must learn that there are those who know what is best for them, and if they weren&rsquo;t ingrates they would appreciate being guided in the way that is diverse and for their benefit. </p>

			<p>As someone born in ireland i can say it is a fairly common sentiment that the irish want to keep ireland for the irish. though we arent against some small amount of  immigrants, whats happening now is out of control.</p>

			<p>They voted in the multiculti parliaments that signed the treaty.  The people of europe are just as much to blame.  Unless you vote for BNP, vlaams belang, national front, swedish democrats, etc, you chose your fate.</p>

			<p>This will not stop the globalists. They&rsquo;ve already announced their intention to carry on despite the Irish vote. If they do, they will have shown the EU to be what it is, unaccountable to the people and incapable of following it&rsquo;s own rules. It is and will be an illegitimate organization. </p>

			<p>AS an Irish/Scots who grew up on the mainland and ran away to America I can say we saw this coming in the 1950&rsquo;s. The Irish did well to oppose the union but at the same time Ireland like England is becoming a non European nation. It has happened lawfully and without war, it is the &#8220;Unholy Roman Empire &#8221; with a dictator in Brussels. It will collapse under its own weight eventually but Europe will forever be a non Caucasian &#8220;nation.&#8221;<br>
The only way old Europe can survive is by revolutionary means. The old Europeans will need to stop aborting their future and drive out the invader.<br>
The problem here is that the average Joe ( USA as well ) is willing to do everything the master demands, even when it demands the abolition of Caucasian culture, the abortion of the babies upon the demand of brainwashed Joe and Jane and euthanizing grand mama as soon as she shows signs of a bad cold or an achy foot.<br>
Minor miracles are needed here to save our people.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s sad that a 53.4% to 46.6% margin is considered evidence of European nationalism. It&rsquo;s like saying, &#8220;The defeat of Quebec&rsquo;s secession referendum 51% to 49% shows that the majority of Quebecers are still fiercely loyal to the Canadian union.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;the irish want to keep ireland for the irish, though we arent against some small amount of immigrants&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;   -   &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
And there&rsquo;s the mistake, the fatal flaw!  Only a few? Just a small amount?  This is what is now starting to happen in Japan. It already happened in the US long before. And then followed in a number of other countries &hellip; (which learned from experience that there is no such thing as &#8220;guest workers&#8221;  or &#8220;temporary workers.&#8221;)   Have the Irish yet to learn the same lesson?  Can they not learn from the mistakes of their neighbors?</p>
<p>Once those immigrants have a foot in the door, their children will demand increased immigration. Then more, and still more. They will complain, will agitate, will demand changes in the law, will batter you with charges of discrimination and with guilt. They will keep at it   &mdash;   for generations, if need be. </p>
<p>We in the USA have seen it all before, culminating in their nation-wrecking triumph of 1965. Their triumph against the very nation that pitied and admitted their grandparents in the first place;  the nation that gave them refuge, security, and wealth. In appreciation, they campaigned to destroy it!  Now, we have further demands for linguistic  changes and religious/legal accommodations for new minority groups.  Even demands for outright separatism (Aztlan etc.)   And even threats! It all began, many years ago, with &#8220;just some small amount&#8221; of immigrants.</p>
<p>And so, hindsight teaches us that there is no such thing as &#8220;just a few&#8221; immigrants. The flood always begins with a trickle.  And once the floodgate is opened, it can never be shut.</p>

			<p>Once a nation votes to join the EU, the decision is effectively irreversible. </p>
<p>The strategy is, then, to continue to bring the measure to a vote until it passes, as it eventually will in all targeted nations.</p>

			<p>Those who study it will understand the European fought very hard to stop the open-borders, third world onslaught.  Just like Americans, Canadians, Australians.  Yet they lost, as have we&hellip;so far.  Don&rsquo;t believe what the controlled MSM say, European-Christians are the target, and we fight, but we are not running our nations&rsquo; governments or media, and thereby lose&hellip;so far.</p>
