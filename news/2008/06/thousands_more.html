						<p>Police Director Ingelin Killengreen was due to deliver a report on staffing needs to the Justice Ministry on Monday. In it, she notes that Norway&rsquo;s population is expected to grow not least through immigration, and that poses new challenges.</p>
<p>There are now 460,000 immigrants living in Norway, mostly from Sweden and other European countries but also from the Americas, Asia and Africa. The total number of immigrants in Norway is expected to rise to 1,050,000 by 2020, with two-thirds coming from western nations and one third from eastern European nations and developing countries.</p>
<p>Since the police handle immigration cases on behalf of the immigration agency, more staffing will be needed. It also will be needed to tackle a rising crime rate and ongoing domestic migration from the countryside to the cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be prepared to receive immigrants in a way that also will help prevent crime better than we manage today,&#8221; Killengreen said. &#8220;We need more police with immigrant background themselves, and experts with more insight into foreign cultures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Killengreen wants 2,700 more police officers in uniform and 1,000 plainclothes cops on the beat. Justice Minister Knut Storberget welcome the police report and called the needs a &#8220;sober and realistic analysis&#8221; of crime in Norway and how to deal with it.<br>

			<p>Any sane person would read that and conclude what it doesn&rsquo;t say: that the newcomers from other non-compatible cultures commit the crime.</p>

<p>I wonder why!</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;We need more police with immigrant background themselves.&#8221; </b></p>
<p>Brilliant!   That should solve it., </p>
<p><b>&#8220;There are now 460,000 immigrants living in Norway, mostly from Sweden and other European countries but also from the Americas, Asia and Africa. The total number of immigrants in Norway is expected to rise to 1,050,000 by 2020.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>I can guarantee that most of those immigrants from Sweden are not from  Sweden but merely <i>via  </i>Sweden.  They are not Swedes!  And  the same for those  &#8220;other European countries&#8221;.  They are not Europeans, but via Europe.  Nor are there very many white Americans among those &#8220;from the Americas&#8221;.</p>
<p>Norway, a small country with merely four and half million people, is to be 1/4 composed of foreigners in just another 12 years?    What will it be in 50 years?  That means the extinction of the Norwegian nation!   It&rsquo;s a  glaring, undebatable mathematical fact that apparently means nothing at all to those Marxist brainwashed traitors who are in power.  And it&rsquo;s probably illegal even to discuss it.</p>

<p>The same thing over and over, in country after country. The &#8216;good ones&rsquo; are not going to save you from the &#8216;bad ones.&rsquo; Their loyalty is to each other not to the people of the host country. In WWII Roosevelt had his famous &#8216;Look to Norway&rsquo; speech. Maybe Norway should &#8216;Look to America&rsquo; for a lesson on how NOT to let problem populations grow past the tipping point.</p>

<p>No, what you need is to stop importing 3rd world immigrants and start deporting the ones you have. Problem solved.</p>

			<p>Watching the goings on in the Scandanavian countries makes it look like the last smart thing they did was to form the 5th SS Viking Division. It at least, fought to the last white man.</p>

			<p>The immigrants causing the mess in Norway and for the most part Somalis. Somalis are also a sheer nightmare in Finland and also in the US. Somali refugees have no place in any sane European country, or in the US. There are plenty of African countries they can go to. Looks like their 15% White genes doesn&rsquo;t do Somalis a lot of good.</p>
<p>When you are in a whole, stop digging. When immigrants destroy your land, you stop importing the bad ones.</p>

			<p>I agree with Robert. The bottom is reached when you stop digging. </p>
<p>The solution is to deport, repatriate, end immigration. It always was the solution and it always will be.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We need more police with immigrant background themselves, and experts with more insight into foreign cultures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In our politically correct/cultural Marxist societies liberals are totally dominant in academia, the media, politics &amp; other fields so they are feeding off the gravy train. So let&rsquo;s not fool ourselves that these greedy hogs are humanitarians. And <br>
notice how these multiculuralist/diversity types continually look to expand &amp; add to their numbers thus creating the need for even more immigrants thus perpetuating an ever-increasing cycle of stupidity &amp; ignorance &amp; destruction of white nation-states. And Norway is not even a member of the EU &amp; therefore does not have to take in any immigrants at all. I have to say it again: LIBERALISM IS A MENTAL ILLNESS</p>
<p>Stop bringing in third-world immigrants. Problem solved. It&rsquo;s not rocket science you pathetic liberal jellyfish.<br>

When immigrants have destroyed or taken your land, it&rsquo;s generally too late to stop importing. (Ask any American Indian.)</p>
<p>The time to do it is BEFORE.  Unfortunately, one of the sad facts of life is that wisdom usually comes AFTER.<br>

<p>Why not simply BAR all immigration by Africans and deport those already in Norway. Then step back and watch the crime count plummet! Somalis are Black Africans. Black Africans are to crime what cold is to ice. You can&rsquo;t have Africans without crime. Sort of like a law of nature, I suppose.</p>
<p>On the matter of needing another 3,700 police officers&hellip; WHY on earth would you need them&hellip; if immigrants were the fine, decent, honest and industrious people the locals are told to believe they are? Seems like a contradiction in terms, right?</p>
