						<p>A Danish appeals court on Thursday rejected a lawsuit against the newspaper that first printed the controversial Prophet Muhammad cartoons in 2005, saying they were not intended to insult Muslims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The court in Aarhus, 125 miles (200 kilometers) northwest of Copenhagen, upheld last year&rsquo;s lower court ruling, which rejected claims by Danish Muslims that the 12 drawings were meant to insult the prophet and make a mockery of Islam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Jyllands-Posten daily has apologized and said it had not intended to offend Muslims. But it stands by its decision to print the drawings to challenge a perceived self-censorship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nehme [Mohammed Nehme, a spokesman for Islamic Faith Community] said the group had not yet decided whether to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The court ruled that terror acts have been carried out in the name of Islam, and that it was not illegal under Danish law to make satirical drawings to illustrate that.</p>

			<p>I see the goings on in the Netherlands as the beach head of an invasion of Europe by the Muslims. Europe was sold out by the U.S. in helping establish a Muslim southern beach head in Kosovo and that, with the Northern assault will finally bring all of Europe into the Muslim sphere of power, influence and terror.</p>

<p>Which of course, to the Muslims, means LET THE RIOTS BEGIN!! they love to do that in western countries because it gets them what they want which is, whatever they want. They would&rsquo;t get away with that kind of thing in Saudi or Kuwait, only in the Muslim ass kissing western counties does it work.</p>

			<p>Regarding Skip&rsquo;s comments on Kosovo, Serge Trifkovic has written extensively on this matter in &#8220;The Sword of the Prophet&#8221;. For  instance,  he says that,  <i>In addition to being a terrorist base, Bosnia has become a staging post for illegal Muslim immigrants from the Middle East making their way into Western Europe&hellip;European officials fear that many terrorist operatives and potential recruits are slipping in.   A senior UN official watching another planeload of Iranians fly into Sarajevo airport on an almost daily smuggling run commented: &#8220;There should be a sign on the tarmac saying, &#8216;Welcome to Bosnia   &mdash;    the open backdoor to Fortress Europe&rsquo;.   In 2000, up to 10,000 migrants a month were arriving there by air and road and then smuggled into Croatia on their way to the main European capitals.<br>
Senior Muslim politicians were not interested in stopping this human cargo and had no reason to try. To most Bosnian Muslims, it is a great and good thing to help as many of their co-religionists as possible to settle in the infidel West. </i></p>
<p>Considering our government&rsquo;s imcomprehensible support of Kosovo, Bosnia, and of Turkey&rsquo;s entrance into the EU, one has to wonder whether our officials are insane, or merely stupid, or are they deliberately subversive?  They invariably do nothing that&rsquo;s helpful to Christian Europe.</p>
