<h1>Project Immigration: Illegal Immigrant Healthcare</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WJLA-TV (Washington, D.C.), June 20, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In this Project Immigration report, we take a look at the high cost of illegal immigrant health care in the Washington area and nationwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;As of today, I have a patient from Mexico who&rsquo;s been in my hospital for 760 days,&#8221; said an administrator at Martin Memorial Medical Center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We had an illegal immigrant patient from Guatemala. He had more than $1.5 million in healthcare services,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Florida hospital spent $30,000 to send the Guatemalan home after two years, there was hardly a thank you from his relatives.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His family in the United States is now suing us,&#8221; she said. We&rsquo;ve spent nearly a quarter of a million dollars in legal fees since the family thought it was inappropriate of us to return him to his home country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Washington area hospitals are facing the same dilemma.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hospitals are legally and some say &mdash; morally &mdash; obligated to treat patients regardless of their ability to pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just had a gentleman here for 275 days. He was from El Salvador,&#8221; said Orlowski [Dr. Janis Orlowski, chief medical director at Washington Hospital Center].</p>
<p>The problem is once illegal immigrants land in an acute care facility like Washington Hospital Center, the hospital is stuck caring for them and can&rsquo;t legally transfer the patients to a more appropriate, less costly long-term care facility.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Washington Hospital Center treats illegal immigrants on a weekly basis, at the cost of millions of dollars of unreimbursed care. Hspital beds are often full.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And American taxpayers pick up the tab.</p>
<p>Just this week Washington Hospital Center spent $80,000 to send two illegal immigrants back to their home countries.<br>

			<p>Not only does America already have taxpayer funded healthcare for illegal immigrants, it also has Marxist public health officials who will lie and aid and abet ID and job theft by illegal immigrants. And we&rsquo;re not talking a border state, Chicago, NYC, Minnesota, or Portland, Oregon either.  </p>
<p>https://www.thetimesnews.com/news/health_14893___article.html/department_medical.html </p>
<p>This oozed out when an illegal immigrant woman from Mexico was arrested for the theft of the identification of a Hispanic surnamed Texas US citizen woman for the purpose of securing employment with Honda Power Equipment Mfg. This illegal alien woman has since been placed in the 287(g) program for deportation (after she drops her anchor baby in a prison hospital at taxpayer expense and resolves her ID theft charges in state criminal court, again at taxpayer expense)  It seems that she had been recieving WIC funded pre-natal services at the local health department prior to her arrest for ID theft and certain highly paid health department officials were involved in a scheme to maintain her medical records under her &#8220;real name&#8221; but write her post medical appointment back-to-work notes under the stolen name she had used to secure employment at Honda Power Equipment Mfg. </p>
<p>Health department officials admitted (for what it&rsquo;s worth) that  scenarios involving other Hispanic surnamed patients similar to the one previously described had been playing out two to three times a month over the past year. Honda Power Equipment Mfg. set up shop in this community about 25 years ago after a long courtship with state and local officials and chamber of commerce people and a generous taxpayer funded industrial incentive package that was granted to bring &#8220;high paying world class manufacturing jobs&#8221; to the &#8220;citizens&#8221; of Alamance County, North Carolina. This incident now marks at least the second time that Honda Power Equipment Mfg. has been implicated in public court records as having Mexican illegal aliens on its payroll. </p>

			<p>Hospitals are legally and some say &mdash; morally &mdash; obligated to treat patients regardless of their ability to pay.</p>
<p><br>
As a physician, I would like to point out something.  First is the legal issue.  Illegals do not actually have the legal right to care.  Rarely, do we pass laws giving them that right.  Instead, courts have taken it upon themselves to bend the law in such a way that successful torts create liability if care is refused.</p>
<p>That could be changed by actually passing laws curtailing this and curtailing the abuse of power by our courts (something that is decades overdue on a broad scope of issues).</p>
<p>The other is the moral obligation.  We take an oath to do no harm.  But we are NOT obligated to provide care, let alone for free, let alone to people who are enemies to our nation and our communities.  My oath is intended to prevent abuse of my knowledge as a physician to harm others.  It exists specifically to prevent the types of abuses that happened under the nazi and stalinist regimes.  But to insist the oath obligates me, or any other physician to provide care, else something bad happen to the person, is a distortion.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous when you have uninsured americans that can&rsquo;t afford healthcare. Why isn&rsquo;t our government sending Mexico the bill?  I heard that some Canadians who came across the border legally on a visit and fell ill and were hospitalized for months. They were charged huge fees. Why not Mexicans,  oh I forgot, free medical care only extends to the non-whites, sorry my mistake. Those who say the USA has no national health system are wrong,  we do provide free medical care as long as you are non-white or non-white and non-american.</p>

<p>Aztecs are just like Zulus. They have no gratitude. Why should they when the gringo fools teach them that health care is a universal right?<br>

			<p>Hospitals have a legal and moral right to provide care for an illegal with no money ONLY  in an emergency situation. Once stabilized, the illegal should be sent home and the mexican government billed for the cost. The only exception is if two countries have a reciprical agreement where each will provide medical care free of charge (ie.like the EU.) However, Mexico does not let americans use its&rsquo; socialized medical system for free so we are under no obligation whatsover to do the same.</p>

			<p> This one really hits home for me. I just retired after 35 years on the same job. I worked and paid BIG taxes. Now, I am paying for part of my health care as a retiree. While I was working, our health care was negotiated as part of our contract, alot of times in leiu of mmonetary gains. Now, as a retiree, I am no longer considered a valued employee, I am now considered a burden. Now I pay a percentage of my health care out of pocket. And still don&rsquo;t have the benefits I had before, no dental plan nor vision plan. It really hits me hard to see all these illeglas receive better health care than I have and they don&rsquo;t contribute anything to the system.  In the 35 years I worked, I paid out $945,000 just in FEDERAL taxes alone, not including state, local, fica, social security, or anything else. I know that isn&rsquo;t much considering what others have paid out, but I should have received a better return on this money than taking care of illegals with it. </p>

			<p>If the concept that ILLEGAL ALIENS HAVE THE AUTOMATIC RIGHT TO FREE HEALTHCARE IS NOT AN OBSCENITY, THEN WHAT IS?</p>
<p>As a hardworking Amerian taxpayer who has been aware of this crime against our people for years, I am totally OUTRAGED! By the double-insult of illegal aliens flooding over our borders, then becoming perpetual burdens on Americans with their demands for taxpayer funded hand-outs.</p>
<p>Their crime   &mdash;   illegal Mexican immigrants expecting, DEMANDING that we taxpayers support these parasites, is what fuels our national anger over the illegal immigration issue! We are NOT against Mexicans for being Mexican. We are outraged that they are within our country, costing us $90 BILLION a year to subsidize and support them. This in addition to the endless crimes they commit once here, in addition to the endless social problems they pose with their presence and lifestyle!</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not only the illegal&rsquo;s if you think about it.  I know there are organizations that treat people from other countries that need extensive and life saving medical treatments that they can&rsquo;t get in their own country.  When they come here, it takes away from our own LEGAL citizens, who are usually left to fend for theirselves.  It&rsquo;s amazing how much of a desirable country we are, and how many people want to come here.  We are laughed at by so many other countries.  What would happen if the United States of America shut it&rsquo;s doors to anyone who is not a natural born LEGAL citizen (by saying nautral born, I am not including children of illegals, because they shouldn&rsquo;t be here in the first place).  It would be nice te see the US Government take care of it&rsquo;s own people for once, instead of catering to every other country that turn their noses up at us.</p>

			<p>That ruling outlawing the death penalty for raping of children&hellip; is a BLESSING for Hispanics. We sure as hell have seen and heard of some disgusting examples in Houston in past years. Around Christmas, 2006 a Mexican grandfather was arrested and charged   &mdash;   FOR RAPING HIS TWO LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTERS! There have also been far too many similar stories   &mdash;   Mexicans raping children   &mdash;   in the Fox newscasts and on Crimestopper segments. Nor are my claims &#8216;made up&rsquo; as I&rsquo;m sure some Hispanic readers would love to suggest. I posted the links on AmRen at the time!!! Rape, child molestation, sexual abuse of children   &mdash;   seems to be as much a part of the Mexican psyche as their penchant for theft and other crimes of opportunity.</p>
<p>CHICAGO - Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama said Wednesday they disagree with the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision to outlaw the executions of people who rape children.</p>
<p>McCain called the ruling an &#8220;assault&#8221; on legal system. Obama said it is wrong to flatly prohibit the death penalty in such cases if states want to apply it. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll bet this is just politics, Obama is trying to sound like  he is tough on crime just to get votes but I&rsquo;ll bet underneath it all, he agrees with the SC.<br>
