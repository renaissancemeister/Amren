<p>The topic is also luring researchers. A study by Sean F. Reardon, of Stanford University, found that the achievement gap between white and black students grew faster among those who enter kindergarten with high skill levels. At Yale, researchers are devising a test that they hope could identify a more diverse gifted population.</p>

<p>So, there you have it.  The goal at this university is NOT to identify gifted students, but to identify &#8220;a diverse gifted population.&#8221;  </p>

<i>&#8220;At Yale, researchers are devising a test that they hope could identify a more diverse gifted population.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>You can bet they&rsquo;ll come up with one no matter how absurd or convoluted it is. As I always say, there people are an endless font of theories that replace failed theories that in theory should have worked but now need a new theory to explain why the old theory didn&rsquo;t work, ad infinitum.</p>
<p>These people can argue that up is down, left is right, and no is yes. Heck, they&rsquo;ve already convinced people that race is a social construct. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to get that square peg into that round hole even if they have to use a sledgehammer (a sledgehammer being an apt metaphor for the long-term destruction these people will cause).<br>

			<p>Both of my sons spent the first 6 years of school in the South Carolina program for gifted and talented children. In those classes I never saw any black children. The children in those programs were identified and selected for enrollment by their various teachers, several of whom were black. The various black organizations (NAACP for example) fought this program and said the standards were to high and could not be met. The suggestion to DUMB DOWN the requirements to be included in this program was protested in Columbia, S.C. on the  state capitol steps and was a newsworthy item. Hundreds of teachers were there to protest this dumbing down which also included MANY black teachers but as you might guess!! the teachers lost and the program shortly after went defunct. Sad, very sad and my boys loved it. </p>

<p>Hey, Oberweis? Have you never heard of &#8216;disparate impact&rsquo;? Its why employers can no longer administer tests for employment. Tests have a &#8216;disparate impact&rsquo; on blacks. A gifted program obviously falls into this category and, therefore, cannot be allowed.</p>

			<p>Well Skip, it appears in your location at least, if the blacks can&rsquo;t get admitted through merit into a gifted program, they will just push to have the program eliminated.  And over the protests of BLACK teachers!</p>
<p>Other locations seem to dumb down the gifted programs so that the appearance is given there is no IQ differences in the races.</p>

<p>Wrong!  They are not devising a test that they hope will IDENTIFY a more diverse population, they are devising a test that is altered sufficiently to qualify blacks, even if it means awarding them points in advance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d likle to see a Nurenberg court prosecutor intensely cross examine these dorks to bring out their prejudices and illogical, brainwashed mind sets.</p>
<p>And after completing that,  I&rsquo;d like to see a jury impose death by public hanging beforewhich each miscreant would be required to denounce himself and his stupidity for being so naive.</p>

			<p>It is very easy to identify &#8220;diverse&#8221; gifted populations, as was recently reported here, South Africa has solved the problem. A white with a passing score of 91% is  gifted, as is a black with a score of 74%. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a pointed observation.  So far, nobody has been able to design a test where blacks do as well as whites.  All they&rsquo;ve been able to do is devise schemes where blacks are given handicap points - awarding points for essay questions and &#8220;holistic criteria&#8221; is just the latest (which, for some unexplained reason, blacks just happen to do exceedingly well on).  I have a feeling the academic test designers will come up with something similar.  So, unless you have an especially large can of shoe polish, you can forget about entry into the gifted program!</p>

			<p>Liberal thought at its finest. That blacks can&rsquo;t pass a test is sufficient proof of the inadequacy not of blacks but of the test. Surely Yale faculty are aware of the test-rigging of the last five decades or so, all of which has been to no avail.</p>

The original article contains a standard technique used by the New York Times to introduce a leftist idea into the flow of a nominally objective story. After starting with the fact that a <i>more</i> objective method was chosen to determine who gets into gifted classes, the second paragraph states:</p>
<p><i>The move was controversial, with experts warning that standardized tests given to young children were heavily influenced by their upbringing and preschool education, and therefore biased toward the affluent. </i></p>
<p>See it? Unnamed experts said .  .  .  uh, unnamed experts said whatever the writer of the piece wanted them to say. Just fill in from memory, writing the point any way you wish.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how dumbing down a test so that a student who is not able to learn calculus gets into a gifted program will do that student any good. He will STILL not be able to learn calculus. What is gained. This is ridiculous nay asinine nay ludicrous. This is actually the thinking of black activists? They are dumb as dirt! Sorry but they are too stupid to realize how stupid this is.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Gifted&#8221; to most blacks means having an I.Q. of 90 to 100, which makes them think they&rsquo;re the greatest intellects in the world, because so many people compliment them on their &#8220;intelligence,&#8221; because they&rsquo;re so accustomed to the average black being barely able to think at all. </p>
<p>Combine those ghastly comments from whites, with a natural black propensity for arrogance, and you have an egotistical black that is barely more than literate but thinks he&rsquo;s a great scholar.</p>

			<p>The concept of &#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221; implicitly goes against the idea of there being any such category as &#8220;gifted.&#8221; If all that is needed for equal success for all is &#8220;Effort Based Education,&#8221; which, along with increasingly fine tuned methodology, is the new fad among educators in inner city public schools, then how can there be such a category as &#8220;gifted&#8221; students?</p>
<p>In fact, believe it or not, there is a tendency now to deny reality when it comes to Special Education students and to assume that with correct effort and methodology that they too can advance well academically.</p>
<p>The only way this intellectual &#8220;house of cards&#8221; to fall, involving diversity and supposed equal average intelligence among all racial groups, is for the U.S. to continue its downward slide towards being a Third World nation, while former Third World countries in Asia that believe in there being gifted students move towards replacing the United States as one of the economic powers in the world. Only when reality hits enough whites in the face will they be ready to overturn the &#8220;totalitarian light&#8221; society we have right now, a society which requires its &#8220;party members,&#8221; the intellectual elite, to all believe the same &#8220;party line&#8221; in order to maintain jobs to support a family.</p>
<p>The bottome line is that while there are more and more intelligent whites, as is the case with this web site, who see what&rsquo;s going on as far as all the brainwashing and lies, how many are willing to stand up in the work place and denounce what they know to be false - at the price of losing their jobs?</p>

			<p>From a presumably southeast Asian [Vietnamese?] poster above:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here in California, the gifted programs are TEAMING with bright minority students- ASIANS.</p>
<p>Posted by Thuy Pham at 2:18 PM on June 22&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir [I assume that word fits], you&rsquo;re admirably close. The word you want is &#8220;teeming&#8221;. It&rsquo;s not a common word, and relatively few native English speakers use it, in my experience. Your imperfect grasp of English is probably better than the average &#8216;old-stock&rsquo; American. And I certainly don&rsquo;t speak Vietnamese or Thai.</p>
<p>On the other hand, your very presence here suggests you or your parents are elite in your native culture  &mdash;  elite, as in not typical or average. The Asian schoolkids you refer to are, like the descendants of the African slave trade, astronomically lucky to be where they are, (if the details are somewhat different)  &mdash;  their immediate ancestors, like you, are almost certainly &#8216;elite&rsquo; to begin with, having brought them here to take advantage of the excellent educational opportunities provided by many thousands of my tax dollars over my entire working life. That&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity that I&rsquo;ve bankrolled! </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>To the real point: the smart Asian kids you mention are not beating out a representative group of white kids, specifically including the children of regular-Joe/Jane wage earners. Those people, and their kids, are going if not gone  &mdash;  ethnically cleansed from the not-so-Golden State  &mdash;  leaving whom as competitors, we might ask? It&rsquo;s a rhetorical question, of course. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be too smug about your oriental &#8216;wunderkinder&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t worry too much. One of these days the minorities will be a very strong majority and some of them (a small percentage) will be gifted and able to compete with white and Asian kids. </p>
<p>Here in South Africa, with whites only being a tenth of the total population, you will still find that the whites out-compete the other races in any activity that require more than two brain cells. The non-whites need affirmative action to force them into positions they don&rsquo;t belong in.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t understand how dumbing down a test so that a student who is not able to learn calculus gets into a gifted program will do that student any good. He will STILL not be able to learn calculus. What is gained.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea is the kid will be able study and use hard work in order to keep up, or even to identify potential high achievers in the first place. Of course they have to Lie, Cheat, and Steal for them all throughout their lives to keep them elevated, and that&rsquo;s just the liberals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d feel better about it if it didn&rsquo;t always have to be a lie - it&rsquo;s the fault of ignorant whites. And then of course they&rsquo;re always angry about these efforts. </p>
<p>To the poster who brought up the Nurenburg trials&hellip; they are always so so purposefully vague with their double talk. They are sticklers however about keeping written records. </p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Oops, the brainwashing wore off&hellip; </p>
<p>Excellent points, friend! Yes, we American taxpayers do get the questionable delights of subsidizing the education of millions of unwanted immigrants and their large broods. Which in part fuels our anger over endless immigration. No, we are NOT racists&hellip; we do LOVE non-Whites&hellip; as long as these people stay in their homelands and not live here in our America.</p>

<p>&#8220;The test already exists. It&rsquo;s called an EKG.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, the EKG will not help Blacks and Hispanics.  But, it will determine which Whites and/or Asians qualify for the new Black and Hispanic &#8220;gifted&#8221; programs.</p>

			<p>I can save the &#8220;researchers&#8221; at Yale a lot of time and money. The best way to increase black and hispanic enrollment in these programs and at the same time decrease White enrollment is to have three separate tests. The test for Whites would be difficult so as to decrease their presence in these programs. The tests for blacks and hispanics would match their &#8220;intelligence&#8221; to increase their population. Questions would go something like this;</p>
<p>For Whites; In 100 words or less prove or disprove the validity of Occam&rsquo;s Razor.</p>
<p>For blacks; Lakeesha broke up with Rufus 5 months ago. You slept with her 3 months ago. She now tells you that she is in her 5th month of pregnancy. Do that baby belong to you, or do it belong to Rufus?</p>
<p>For hispanics: You and Jose are stealing hubcaps from a Hummer. You have loaded 3 of them into your car when the police come and chase you back to the barrio. How many hubcaps did you leave behind? (hint, the spare doesn&rsquo;t count)</p>
<p>This is the only way to ensure that less Whites are admitted and at the same time increasing minority enrollment.</p>

			<p>&#8220;White and proud&#8221; has some pretty good minority questions there. But I found an all-purpose LA public school math test on the Internet several years ago. It was so hilarious I saved it. E-mail me if you&rsquo;d like a copy.</p>
