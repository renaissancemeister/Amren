<h1>Police Union Standing by Mexican Militia Reports</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KFYI (Dallas-Ft. Worth), n.d.</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A top member of a Phoenix police union is standing by reports that at least one of the men involved in a Monday morning home invasion and homicide was an active member in the Mexican Army.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While on the J.D. Hayworth show Tuesday, Mark Spencer announced that the suspects were hired by drug cartels to perform home invasions and murders.</p>
<p>The incident at 8329 W. Cypress St. resulted in the death of the homeowner.  Between 50 and 100 rounds were fired at the house.</p>
<p>Spencer said a police officer told him that one of the men captured said they were completely prepared to ambush Phoenix police, but ran out of ammunition.</p>
<p>He added that all were all dressed in military tactical gear and were armed with AR-15 assault rifles.  Three other men involved in the invasion escaped.</p>

															<h2>Police: Murder Suspects Not in Mexican Military</h2>
											<p>
							<i>JJ Hensley, Arizona Republic, June 26, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>None of the men accused in a deadly west Phoenix home invasion this week is an active member of the Mexican military, according to Phoenix police.</p>
<p>Daniel Garcia-Saenz, 24; Manual Garcia-Trejom, 25; and Rodolfo Madrigal Lopez, 19, were arrested Sunday night in connection with the slaying of Andrew Williams, 30, who was gunned down in his home in the 8300 block of West Cypress Avenue.</p>
<p>The assailants wore body armor, had assault-style rifles and used more than 100 rounds of ammunition.</p>

			<p>So what do you call it when members of a foreign military violate your borders and kill your citizens? It used to be considered an act of war and an insult to the honor of your country.  Before World War I a Mexican bandit, General Francisco &#8220;Pancho&#8221; Villa and his men made a raid on the American border town of Columbus, New Mexico.  We sent our best General John J. Pershing and then Lieutenant George Patton with a column of troops to restore order to the Mexican border states. We never caught Villa but it stopped the cross border raiding.  That was back when our country was still led by men who believed in the American nation state.</p>

			<p>I need to get out of Arizona; the whole place has gotten much worse, not better! Our media has made its loyalties clear, and now attacks law enforcement for enforcing the laws, and calling anyone who would say no to a Mexican to be a racist, xenophobic hick. Even my newspaper, The East Valley Tribune has changed its format to a Hispanic-friendly format (it looks like a La Voz now,) and has a glut of Hispanic articles on the new Hispanic-centric shopping center being built in west Mesa, and how evil Sheriff Joe is conducting &#8220;Immigration Sweeps&#8221; today, and where to go for the &#8220;civil disobedience&#8221; protests. <br>
When my mom got home from work she took one look at the paper and said &#8220;it looks like a trashy tabloid!&#8221; I told her that if it were up to me, the subscription would be canceled, with a letter to the editor detailing exactly why. Unfortunately, the Tribune is one of only two major papers in the area, and the other is the Arizona Repulsive (Republic), which has been a marxist, open borders rag for years. Now the white people of Phoenix have no one to speak for them.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like a white friendly conservative could make a lot of money with a community monthly publication.  They&rsquo;re not too difficult to start, and the revenue from ads is better than one could do holding down a 9-5 job. </p>

			<p>It is becoming absurd to continue to discuss any of the different facets of racism  &mdash;  IQ, socioeconomics, affirmative action, discrimination, uneducability, unassimilation, etc. The only subjects that should be discussed on forums like these is why are whites being systematically genocided?</p>
<p>The slaughter of whites, the appropriation of their history and culture, and their dispossession is too pervasive to just dismiss it as &#8220;misguided policies by liberals&#8221;. There is something deeply sinister about this, and no amount of talk about IQ or anything else is going to &#8216;fix&rsquo; what is going on. </p>
<p>Elegant articles that do nothing but reiterate facts that most of us are already aware of seems to me like a whimpy way to &#8216;fight the fight&rsquo;. For example, on the resistdefamation.org website, one writer blatantly tells his readers that whites &#8216;are powerless to change things&rsquo;. Page after page of seemingly good information on how to &#8220;resist&#8221;, yet in the end, we are still powerless to change what is going on  &mdash;  -namely our genocide.</p>
<p>What we need is some serious speculation, call it conspiracy theorizing if you want, as to WHY this is being allowed to happen, and WHO, at the very top pinacle of power, is dictating these policies? </p>
<p>In my opinion, any other conversation about this subject is terribly redundant and nothing  more than drivel.</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, Fed send millions to Mexicans to arm themselves with defence weapons to supposedly defend their side of the border.  Guess we know how they will use the money now!<br>
I wrote the Washington Post years ago about sending millions to Mexico so they can arm themselves against the drug cartels that rule the country.  How dumb is it when a border state, never an ally, is given millions for defense to perhaps ultimately use against US???  V</p>

			<p>It would be interesting to know why their picked their victim.  If a drug cartel was paying them to fire 100 rounds of ammunition into someone&rsquo;s home, we can be sure the victim was not selected at random.  He was either in the drug trade himself, or was somehow connected with law-enforcement.</p>

<p>I was referring to the smaller type newspapers that pop up from time to time in many areas.</p>
<p>I worked for one within a large city that had a circulation of 75,000, which brought in several thousand dollars in NET revenue each month.  It was very profitable. It consisted of a news section, space ads and a few classifieds.  </p>
<p>It started out as a monthly with a circulation of only about 5,000 homes.  The papers were laid on the counters of convenience stores and other small businesses in the beginning, then boxes were added.  When revenue allowed, the papers were mailed out in mass mailings to homes in the area.  The paper began with the publisher and his wife and grew into a small, but efficient staff, all of whom were paid pretty well.  The sales staff were on commision and didn&rsquo;t earn their money until their ads were paid for.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to do the same can probably contact the Idaho Observer to see if they still have a software package for newspaper layout.  They used to sell the package reasonably.  If they don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they could turn you on to someone who can help.  They always seem ready to help out any patriot or conservative.  Too, it&rsquo;s not really that difficult to start out as a newsletter on 17&#8221; x 11-1/2 paper, folded over. </p>
<p>A person wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily need a software package if he/she couldn&rsquo;t afford it in the beginning.  Paying a local newspaper that runs &#8220;shopper&#8221; bulletins to print the newsletter should be inexpensive also.  At printing time, the owner could throw the papers in his truck/auto, then make the rounds to distribution points.</p>

			<p>I came to Phoenix AZ almost 11 years ago.. and initially fell in love with the city&hellip; the state&hellip; and the people.  Now, I feel trapped in a foreign country.  I am watchng the streets turn into the ghettos of Mexico (you know, those places the illegals are claiming they are running away from); the educational system is one of the worst in the nation (especially when the TEACHERs can&rsquo;t even speak proper English, I used to love the Spanish language and now hearing it pisses me off. The unemployment rate grows at a tremendous rate and our liberal Governor&hellip; can&rsquo;t see the forest for the trees.  Get rid of the Illegals (and unfortunately 99 percent of them ARE Mexican&hellip;  make English our National Language&hellip; Close the Borders&hellip; and get back an American Culture.  No more of this diversity nonsense.  I am NOT an American Indian/German American&hellip; I am an AMERICAN.  Can&rsquo;t we just go back to that and stop the PC stupidity that is destroying our country&hellip; it has definitely destroyed AZ.  </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Mex Army was involved in any way with this incident, though one or more of the perps could well be ex-military.</p>
<p>But the bigger story here not mentioned is that Mexican drug violence has been creeping up into the US for years now and has been accelerating just recently.  It won&rsquo;t be long before they acts like these are common place, and even more gang influence will have a much firmer hold in the US.</p>
<p>We have to legalize drugs or close off the Mexican border completely.  Since the US govt. will do neither, the logical outcome will be more drug violence and influence and in the process of it all we will be one step closer to all out civil conflict.</p>

			<p>You know, a similar incident occurred in unincorporated San Mateo County California last week. A triple murder with an illegal AR-15 and other weapons located at the scene (read about ithere).</p>
<p>Just a coincidence, or enemy action? You be the judge, our lines are open&hellip;</p>

			<p>Again, a clear and present danger to the U.S. Between the drug cartels assaults on us and the assaults from Washington D.C. it is a matter of time before total civil disobedience becomes common place. I am stocking up on weapons and ammo (more of all of it) my friends, family and others will be ready. If things begin on a small scale, Washington D.C. will have a chance to curtail it and hush the MSM so things will have to explode in a number of very public and perhaps messy places. Detroit, D.C. and maybe N.O. will do for a start.</p>
