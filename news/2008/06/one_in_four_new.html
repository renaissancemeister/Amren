						<p>One in four adults living in New York City has the virus that causes genital herpes, and among African-Americans the rate is almost 50 percent, official statistics show.</p>
<p>The sexually transmitted herpes simplex virus Type 2 is more prevalent in New York City, at 26 percent, than nationally, where 19 percent of adults, roughly one in five, are infected.</p>
<p>Far more women than men have the virus, 36 percent compared to 19, in the city mythologized in the television-turned-movie megahit &ldquo;Sex in the City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The study by New York City Department of Health also reveals that herpes is far more common among African-Americans &mdash; 49 percent &mdash; than whites (14 percent).</p>

			<p>Another article I read on the matter had the correct rate for Gothamers overall, and merely said that the rate was higher among women, blacks and homosexual men.  But it didn&rsquo;t state the rate among those groups, so it&rsquo;s impossible to tell what the rate is among non-black heterosexual men.</p>

<p>So actually, it seems that the risk is increased by factor of 3.5, not 2.  Further, maybe this study has the same quirk of DOJ statistics, where Hispanics are categorized as white.</p>

			<p>Is there any manner of profligacy or notoriety wherein American Blacks do not, by far and away, lead the pack? AIDS, STD&rsquo;s in general, now Herpes alone&hellip;  I suppose all this is somehow the result of some &#8220;sexual racism&#8221; or what have you.</p>
<p>A young(18-19)white girl who woks at a local gas/convenience store I frequent appears to have a &#8220;thing&#8221; for blacks. She seems a sensible girl, is attractive, very polite and even rather charming. Now I have seen her outside on several occasions cavorting about with several black males and what appeared to be a mullato-thug who may be a boyfriend. It breaks my heart to witness this decadence in action. How have we gone so terribly wrong??  </p>

<p>You are exactly right! The problem is that the majority of sexual promiscuity that takes place among Whites is among White males. STD&rsquo;s among this group accroding to WEB MD have skyrocketed more than 30% since 1986! This is alarming!</p>
<p>The Today show did a segment about the wanton lifwe of many young men, some single,some married - all were White. Their behavior and disregard for monogamy was disgusting. </p>
<p>If you read magazines like Details and other magazines geared toward males, you willl see a constant spate of articles such as &#8220;Meet the guy who is banging your wife&#8221; &#8220;How to have sex with your buddy&rsquo;s or co-workers wife or girlfriend.&#8221; &#8220;Married men who are having sex with their students, clients or babysitters&#8221; etc&hellip; There is almost an unabashed level of encouragement for men to go out and cheat, be promiscuous or unfaithful. The fact is that it is clear that these sort of magazines are geared toward upscale, professional White males.</p>
<p>Obviously, not all White males are engaging in this sort of Lothario type of behavior, but from what I see, far too many are! </p>
<p>Some of our White male brethern need to grow up!  </p>

<p>In terms of hard data as support, when it comes to black/white interracial marriages nearly 75% are white female/black male arrangements.  The only non-whites that white males seem to marry are Asian females, who have STD rates typically lower than whites.</p>
<p>It appears than white women do indeed bear more of the blame if they choose to sleep with blacks.  </p>

<p>Sure there are some men out there guilty of the same bad judgment but they are outnumbered by white women who choose to date blacks.  Next time you go to the mall just count the difference in numbers of white women/black males vs white men/black women.  This doesn&rsquo;t make me a sexist anymore than pointing out that statistically black males commit more crimes than white males.  It is just the facts.  You may not like the facts, you may not like that I point them out but unless you are brainwashed or deliberately deceitful you should welcome the truth into your life.</p>

<p>What about white men who have dated non-white women? Are such white men considered tainted?</p>
<p>For centuries, white women have had to endure hypocrisy and double-standards. It is white men who created the large number of mulattos in this country, before and after the slavery years, through their relations with non-white women.</p>
<p>I just wish race realists would be as angry with white men who import mail-order brides from Asia and Latin America, as they are with the relatively few white women who &#8220;cross the line&#8221;. How many white women import mail-order husbands from the third world?</p>
<p>If you have actually lived in New York, you would know that it is far more common for white males to visit non-white prostitutes, than it is for white women to date non-white males.</p>
<p>White women are the real victims in this story. It is more common for white men to infect white women with STDs acquired from non-white partners, than the reverse. White women as a group have the lowest HIV infection rate in America (and that includes white lesbians). </p>

			<p>So white women are sluts and white males are saints?  Nice try!  I guess all the sanctimonious white males on here don&rsquo;t know as many white males as I do that engage in BLACK behavior (multiple sex partners and infidelity which lead to broken families).  Broken families lead to slutty white women. It&rsquo;s the more conservative immigrants that come here that are raising traditional families with morals, not whites.  </p>

<p><br>
A solid reason for whites in general, male or female, to feel that way. Since black women also staggering record of carrying some form of STD, be it HIV, Herpes, Chlamydia, You name it! Sleeping with blacks is truly a form of Sexual Russian Roulette, that the wise would resist at all costs. Of course, many blacks believe that all races are lining up to race mix with them.</p>

<p>I have never seen a White male escorting a black female.  Not in all of my 30+ years.  The majority of race mixing involves black man/White woman.  Period.  How often do you see a famous, rich black athlete, actor, or rapper consorting with their own?  Very rarely.</p>
<p>I have had multiple White women ask me my worth, and even my parents&rsquo; worth.  As I exit I respond &#8220;More than yours obviously.&#8221;  My point being that you are trying to explain away a stereotype that is befitting for a reason.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a &#8216;double standard&rsquo; to blame this on the reckless attitude of boys when, after all, it takes two. Still, I&rsquo;ve suspected it&rsquo;s true young whites are sleeping around far more than we did. Perhaps not as much as the time, after the pill but before AIDs, but more than we did. Some of this may be brought about by our own burgeoning, tho still mostly unspoken, racism. It&rsquo;s the fault of our very own &#8216;WN&rsquo; ideals. The women&rsquo;s-movement has been a lot quieter the last 2 decades also. Something to think about is that white birth rate still isn&rsquo;t up to replacement level and their needs to be more emphasis on marriage. We should face up to the fact this increase in promiscuity is partially our own fault.     </p>

<p>   I can confirm your observation in my region of the country the upper South. You will see twenty white women with black men for every white man with a black woman. However, you do see more white men with East Asian women, who have a very low STD rate. Blacks have the highest rate of STD&rsquo;s. Does that make them more promiscuous  &mdash;  what do you think?</p>

<p>&gt; This poster has a bit of a point.  The under 35 set has more miscegenating among white males.  But from my own observation it is still a great deal less than white female.</p>

<p>&gt; I think that I can safetly suggest that the majorty of white men who are behaving like this are liberal and in fact, aping what they take as the black lifestyle.  AT one time now long ago, it was also rare for a white man to abandon his wife and children.  Now, that is far more common.  Although the reasons for that may be diverse, the bottom line is that white men are no longer expected to behave honorably - but neither are white women. </p>
<p>Historically in the U.S. Socialism, even communism somehow came to imply a Bohemian lifestyle of easy sex and morals.  A good film that illustrates this well is &#8220;Reds,&#8221; for those who would like to trace a historical take of this on film.  We also know that the Civil Rights Movement of the &rsquo;60s used Leftists from the North to run through Southern towns like Selma on alcohol, drug and sex rampages -(check it out).  We are living in a post &rsquo;60s New Reconstruction Period where drugs and loose living has become to be almost expected and is celebrated on TV and films that have to shock more and more to make a buck.  It takes a strong individual to resist a tide like this and the latest generation hardly knows that there was ever time when things were different.</p>
<p>That is one reason that this entire &#8220;Sex in the City&#8221; epic has been distressing and disgusting.  That STDs are high in such liberal regions can really come as no surprise.</p>
<p>I used to think the idea was silly, but now I would agree with those who say that Marxists, and even Anarchists do everything, work every angle they can to feed the unfortunate natural tendencies that lack of discipline and morals allow.  I would agree with the idea that their core belief is that a world of workers who have no other identity but workers and no moral but &#8220;liberalism&#8221; (that quickly becomes totalitarian control) will bring about the utopia they foolishly believe is possible.  (Imagine a world wide Cuba!)</p>
<p>In the film &#8220;Reds&#8221; these American communists who are enjoying a privileged &#8220;Bohemian&#8221; lifestyle go to Russia in the 1920s to work for the &#8220;world revolution&#8221; and end up dying neglected in a hospital of a common infection.</p>
<p>I know this rambles a bit and may seem a bit off topic, but the problem of STDs is a social and political problem and to fix it, we need to unravel its causes.  But the fix appears to be impossible.  Only a major disaster will change the crash of American society.</p>

			<p>The mulatto Brazilian, mestizo Mexican, mulatto American, etc populations were results of white men interbreeding with black and/or Native American women, many of which were slaves. The slaveowners were almost always white males, not white females. Sexism does not allow some minds to see historical truth.</p>

<p>Many doctors will tell you that women are far more likely to use protection when having sexual intercourse due to the fact that they realize the danger of pregnancy. It is men(White males included) who are much more likely not to use protection abnd thus carry the risk of greater disease.</p>
<p>If a woman gets a disease, it is most likely that she acquired it from a man.</p>

			<p>The fact is that although there may not be as many White male/black female couples as there are Black male/White female(at least publicly), the fact is that many White men (especially under 45)do sneak around, experiment and sleep with Black women and other non-White women. Thus, they do carry STDs as much as anyone else.   </p>

			<p>I will admit, I was one of those White males when I was in my late 20 until my late 30s, who slept around with Black women.  <br>
I became more mature as time progressed. Now I am happily married to a White woman and have three healthy beautiful White children in their 20s</p>
<p>I did contact syphillis and VD a couple of times and got shots to take care of both. Nowadays, it seems that diseases are much more deadly and permanent. </p>
<p>I am now in my mid 50s. I would be much more cautious today than I was back then.</p>

			<p>VonWagner I apologize if I offended you.  That wasn&rsquo;t my intention.  I was just pointing out that alot of White guys won&rsquo;t date a White woman who&rsquo;s been with a black.  I know statistics say that there are more White men in relationships iwth nonwhites than White females.  It is just as disgusting and wrong and I don&rsquo;t in any way condone it whether it&rsquo;s with blacks or orientals.  This article is about blacks with STDs and it poses a danger to race mixers, along with HIV and all those other nasty cooties they&rsquo;ve got.  But you have to admit that White men with black women isn&rsquo;t that common.</p>

			<p>Part of the reason wnite NYC women are dating blacks may be that white men want nothing to do with their attitudes, and prefer Asian or Latin or Euro mail order brides, who are more traditional in their thinking. That leaves otherwise dateable white women with a shortage of eligible white men, and more opportunities to date nonwhites.</p>

  I have  known several of the NYC type, and theres a REASON they aren&rsquo;t married. </p>

			<p>Why must this discussion always deteriorate into a male vs. female fest? There is MORE than enough blame to go around for both sexes in terms of mingling with other races. The reason women are often singled-out however, is that in the current cultural climate, it is indeed white women who make the most ostentatious display of pursuing non-white partners - particularly young females with blacks! This is naturally more offensive to most AR readers, white nationalists or what have you, than a misguided white male dating a Japanese girl, or very light-skinned Hispanic. This is not to say the latter are ideal or excused-away either; but they ARE different in order of magnitude of concern&hellip;just look again at the topical reason for this whole post for the statistical evidence!</p>

			<p>Sure most women get STDs from males. It&rsquo;s very hard for a woman to get an STD from another woman. From my own rather unfortunate personal experience, I would say that one reason Black women have more STDs than White women is because too many of them simply do not give a damn about their health. White women are much more heath conscious and likely to go to the doctor. </p>
<p>I doubt there is any shortage or White men for White women. They just need to lower their standards, and too many won&rsquo;t do that. Here in California it&rsquo;s common for a woman to ask what your net worth is before she will go out with you (I&rsquo;m not kidding!). </p>
<p>White women are going out with Black men because they find them more masculine than White men, plus, with older White women, a Black man will just grab any White woman he can, and middle aged single White guys are often chasing younger women, so middle aged White women feel left out in the cold and go for Black guys. </p>
<p>I run a Yahoo group for romance scamming and the # of often middle aged White women who are involved with or were involved with Black men is simply astounding. Quite a few are running off to Nigeria and Ghana to marry their criminal African Internet lovers. Almost all of these relationships are disastrous for the White women.</p>

			<p>All women will go with whomever appreciates them regardless of race.  The only men who openly appreciate white women are black men.  It used to be black men with unattractive white women but black men are better off economically so now you see black professional men marrying attractive white women.  On the other hand white men are on message boards talking about their love for nonwhite women and their disgust at white women.  It&rsquo;s a good time to be a white man - they can have women from all around the world.  Even white male celebrities are dating and marrying nonwhite women.  The good times for white males are fading&hellip;.  They are breeding themselves out so rapidly that the future smaller generation of white males may be insignificant and powerless. </p>

			<p>I am not sure how this turned into a discussion on miscegenation.  I am a white female who has only had relationships with white men, I am married to a white man and I have two children who are white.  I have never had an STD.</p>
<p>Although I have found men of other races attractive on occasion, there is always a certain feeling of discomfort about the idea of sex with them that has held me back.  And I am always more than a little wary of men who fetishize women of other races, particularly Asian women.  </p>
<p>Most of them probably wouldn&rsquo;t have dated me as I am not their &#8220;type&#8221; (curly auburn hair and a classic &#8220;hourglass&#8221; figure in the size 6-8 range), although the 2 guys I did date who claimed to have a thing for Asian women were unable to leave me alone!!</p>
<p>Bear in mind that women are generally more particular about their sex partners than men are   &mdash;   at least this woman.</p>

They believe that they are God&rsquo;s good gift to women.  I don&rsquo;t really consider that &ldquo;appreciating&rdquo; women means you are sleazy bed-hopping Lothario.</p>

<p>You make an interesting point. I am a White woman who got married in 1963. During this time White men were still men for the most part. Strong, rugged, many were handsome and masculine. My late husband who died in 2004 in a car accident fit all those categories. I noticed the comment you made about White women finding Black men more masculine than White men. </p>
<p>I am now 64 years old and my three children are long grown.  Obviously, I do not plan to marry again. Nonetheless, my age has gvine me lots of tiem to observe things over the years. </p>
<p>However, I have to honestly say that if I were in my 20s in this day and time or looking to find a suitable mate, there would be only a few White males that I would be willing to marry. Let me make it clear that I would never marry outside of my race, but I can see why some yuonger White women do find Black men (to use your term) more masculine than White men.</p>
<p>It seems that when I was growing up in Indiana in mid to late 1950s and early 1960s that out of a group of 10 White men you could guarantee that at least 7 of them would be rugged and masculine. The weak, wimpy, emasculated ones were in the minority. </p>
<p>Now it seems that if you took these same 10 White men, no more than 4 at best would personify the characteristics that, to me, represent true, mature manhood. Too many are immatuure, wimpy, sex addicted, experiment with bisexuality or homosexuality or those that are heterosexual sleep with everything and anything they can. It has become a sad state of affairs. This does not bode well for the future of our people.</p>

<p>For those of you that do know people that date outside their race, perhaps a change of friends, associates, or colleagues is in order.  Fratrenizing with these sorts has never been my concern, then again I am not new to my way of thinking.  </p>

<p>That may be a secondary reason but the main one is a lack of self esteem.  Too much supply and not enough demand.  Black women are desperate for a relationship but too many black men are in prison or with White women or just simply irresponsible.  Black women are just too anxious to please any man that comes along in the hope that a relationship will blossom out of it.  She puts out on the first date and never hears from him again and then goes on the prowl for another.   </p>

<p>By this I mean that for example, I could poll six people and ask them thier opinion of gay marriage. Five of them could say that they favor gay marrige. That would be 87%.</p>
<p>I could go and publish this result and people would be under the impression that almost 90% of americans favor gay marriage. I have only polled six people. Moreover, I could go into areas where there is a large gay clinetele where the number would be highger or a person with an anti-gay or anit-gay marriage agenda could go to a very conservaitive, homophobic area and conduct knowing that the likelihood of a large anti-gay response would be likely.</p>

			<p>In my experience (at least in the part of North America where I live) the OVERWHELMING number of mixed-race couples is black-male/White female. I see at least twenty BM/WF couples for every one WM/BF. At least. It is also my experience that White females began dating across the color line, long before White males did. A few thoughts here. I have often wondered what the private thoughts of black females are about all this. What a devastating rejection it must be to see so many of their own men prefer women of another race. I recall the O.J. Simpson trial Jurors being mostly black women and they apparently despised Nicole, an attractive blonde. I would also point out that in defense of White males dating non-Whites, chiefly east Asian females, if A certain percentage of White females are going to date outside their racial group this is going to create a &#8220;mate-deficit&#8221;. White males are naturally going to try and make up the shortfall somewhere. East Asians are closer genetically and in I.Q. to Whites then blacks. I feel White females must harbor the blame for this situation. Many young White girls I know almost regard dating a black male as some kind of &#8216;rite of passage&rsquo; as if proof that they are &#8220;enlightened&#8221; and &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; compared to a reactionary &#8220;racist&#8221; like myself.</p>

			<p>Back in 2002, in New Jersey, we had a case were three White men (yes men, not teenage boys)were arrested for having sex with more thasn 40 Black women over a two month period. Some of these women were as young as 14 years old! The men I believe were all in their mid to late 20s at the time.</p>
<p>These men were in a pact to see which one of them could have the most sex with as many Black women as possible. What made this disgusting story worse was the fact that one of the three was a recently married man at the time! </p>

			<p>Why did this turn into another &#8220;he said&hellip;she said&#8221; argument?  It seems to always be a few white male posters on here who start this stuff when the article doesn&rsquo;t even give a sufficient reason to.  From reading the article, it is clear that this is mostly a minority problem.  Does anybody on here even realize what percentage of that city is still white?  But yet, so many white males on here are quick to turn this into a white woman bashing fest.</p>
<p>Both sexes are equally guilty.  I live in Southeastern Virginia and I see black women with white men constantly.  I am not exaggerating.  I never see the reverse, hardly.  I see the same patterns in major cities such as Boston and New York.  I understand that overall white women are more likely to end up with black men as opposed to white men with black women, but this is what I have seen in major cities.  </p>
<p>Another thing that needs to be mentioned is that the percentage of whites miscegnating overall is miniscule (around 3%).  And the percentage of whites miscegnating with blacks makes up the smallest proportion of that percentage.  (Look at the Census Bureau statistics).  So the white men who are making these absurd claims that &#8220;75% of all miscegnation cases are wf/bm&#8221; obviously don&rsquo;t know what they are talking about at all.  And even if that were true, it is still a small minority of white women overall who are miscegnating to begin with.  Stop acting as if 90% (or even just 30%) of us are doing this.</p>
<p>Some of the comments above are shocking to me.  Men of any race are obviously much more promiscuous than the women of their race.  This is a simple matter of biology.  Deal with it, men, and stop acting as if white women are the main problem here.  I am in my late 20s and I am getting fed up with the white &#8220;men&#8221; (boys) I date who have absolutely no interest in settling down. Either that or they are too busy telling me about their past girlfriend who was from Thailand.</p>
<p>And that brings me to my next point.  Someone above said &#8220;not all nonwhites are equal&#8221;.  So what?  They are nonwhite.  Either you are with us or you are against us.  I don&rsquo;t consider finding a wife from Thailand much more noble than a white woman finding an American black man, to be quite honest with you.</p>
<p>In any case, this constant bashing needs to stop.  Do you white men want us to stick with you in this movement or not?  I am a loyal white, and I NEVER intend to even date a nonwhite, but some of the stuff I read on here makes me feel as if I am not wanted amongst your circle.  It sounds as if most of you would rather fight the fight with Asian brides at your side.</p>

<p>By no means did I intend for my comments to be construed as &#8220;all White females.&#8221;  Unfortunately, when I see half-black/half-White offspring, the fathers are nonWhite.  </p>
<p>My point was that for a White male making a good living, and carrying himself with a little pride, is not enough to attract White females like it used to.  When I say that multiple White females have asked about mine and my family&rsquo;s incomes, I point out that the bling nonWhites love to show off has become more important than values, ethics, and morals instilled from generations of hardwork and good parenting.</p>
<p>Maybe White America truly is doomed, but I sure hope not.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;I live in Southeastern Virginia and I see black women with white men constantly. I am not exaggerating. I never see the reverse, hardly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtney I agree with everything you said except for this one statement where I think your being dishonest.  I live in Virginia Beach and I can say emphatically that it is White women who have the jungle fever and not the other way around.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Now it seems that if you took these same 10 White men, no more than 4 at best would personify the characteristics that, to me, represent true, mature manhood. Too many are immatuure, wimpy, sex addicted, experiment with bisexuality or homosexuality or those that are heterosexual sleep with everything and anything they can. It has become a sad state of affairs. This does not bode well for the future of our people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice, seeing that this article is about blacks having higher rates of Herpes and every other STD, you can&rsquo;t honestly believe that black men don&rsquo;t sleep around as much as White men?  Another point, bisexuality or being on the &#8220;down low&#8221; is almost the norm in the black community.  Alice, there are alot of White guys on here that use that same reasoning about women not being feminine enough for their tastes.  I count my blessings that I found a Christian lady with morals who didn&rsquo;t lose her virginity at 12.  No &#8220;switch hitting&#8221;, no tattoos, no militant feminism.  Just a strong woman with good old fashioned moral fortitude.  We&rsquo;ve been married 25 years and we couldn&rsquo;t be happier but if I were younger and had to look for a wife in this day and age, the pickings would be pretty small indeed.</p>

<p>I speak for myself but I am sure others will concur. </p>
<p>No one is attacking white women who date within their own race such as yourself.  You are to be commended for your action and you are most welcome here by this fellow race realist.  We have far too few friends and can ill afford to add to our list of enemies.</p>
<p>Equally, no one is condoning a double standard for white men to date/marry/have affairs outside their race. That would be contrary to the goals of race realism and the higher moral standards that I ascribe to my Amren brethren.  I detest such behavior as much as the reverse.</p>
<p>Opinions have been offered as to why white males seek non-white female relationships. Perhaps some white women were offended by the reasoning, but I think the spirit should be to take the criticism if the shoe fits.  Similarly, you make an observation about white males in their 20s not willing to settle down. I see that perspective but take no offense as a white male because I never have behaved in such a fashion.</p>
<p>No one has suggested that 30% much less 90% of white women are engaging in interracial relationships. As you correctly point out, black/white marriages are still low as a percent of all marriages. From my perspective, let&rsquo;s keep it that way.</p>
<p>As the author of the comment that approximately 75% of U.S. black/white marriages consist of black male and white female arrangements that is true despite your disbelief. I offered this statistic as support to my own anecdotal observations in Manhattan knowing full well that what we see (a small sample size) can at times yield a false conclusion. Yes both sexes are guilty as you say but apparently not equally. </p>
<p>In light of this, my earlier comment that white males should think twice about dating white females who have dated blacks in light of higher HSV2 rates hardly constitutes a bashing of all white women.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Being married to an Asian woman while criticizing white women who date blacks is &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo; only if you think Asians and blacks are somehow equivalent, Rita, when by any objective measure they are not.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are white and you&rsquo;ve married a non-white and had mixed race kids then you&rsquo;re not white anymore.  You&rsquo;re part of that mass movement called multiculturalism.</p>

<p>In all due respect to you, I am not so much concerned about what Black people do. </p>
<p>What I do know is (and I will repeat it again) that there are far too many White men are involved in bisexuality and homosexuality are promiscuous and do not represent the strong, decent morals that used to be the cornerstone of our race.</p>
<p>Comparing our problems to other races will not solve our dilemma.</p>

			<p>What is being lost in this discussion is the fact that the mainstream media is constantly promoting Black male/White female relationships. Thus, it is only normal that you would see an abundance of relationships in our society given the power of the media.</p>
<p>That being said, this does not mean that there are not White male/Black female sexual liasons taking place. I am more inclined to agree with those of you posters who argue that White male/Black female relationships take place just as frequently. </p>
<p>The difference is that such relationships are not as publicly acceptable. Secondly, a lot of White men with prestigious positions and significant social status in their communities are aware of the fact that they could jeopardize their livelihoods or career advancement by publicly dating or marrying a non-White woman(particularly a Black women).</p>
<p>Hence, many of these men opt to &#8220;sneak around&#8221; and fornicate with these women in hotels, brothels, secret getaways etc&hellip; I have a cousin who is a physician and when the families get together on holidays, he talks (disgustingly with a few of us adults) about the number of White males who seem to have no desire to protect themselves from STDs.  Moreover, he mentioned that whenever he inquires about their sexual partners, at least one third of them will mention that they have been involved with Black women.    </p>
<p>So I do know that such relatioships are taking place, they are just happening more secretly.</p>

<p>   I guess it boils down to what you consider masculine? If you mean responsible behavior and taking care of your family, many black males come up short. Look what Bill Cosby has been saying and read Senator Obama&rsquo;s Fathers Day speech:  <br>

			<p>&#8220;The Today show did a segment about the wanton life of many young men, some single,some married - all were White. Their behavior and disregard for monogamy was disgusting.&#8221;</p>
<p>This once again shows how the media does a skewered take on race.  The above quote describes a HUGE chunk of the black male population and in some places is actually considered the norm.  Yet I&rsquo;m sure The Today Show won&rsquo;t do a spot on that subject.<br>

<p>You are naive. I live in the upper south in the eastern aprt of Tennessee. Earlier this year in February The local newspaper posted the photos and names of 24 men who were busted for homosexual activiity in the local parks in the area. </p>
<p>The sad thing about it was that of the 24 men, 22 were married and 18 had families. moreover, all of them were White. </p>
<p>My sister who lives in North Carolina told me that she has a gay male friend who is single. He says that he gets a countless number of men who solicit him for sex just as many married as unmarried. Vitually all thee men are White The number of married men who attend these clubs is staggering.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a str8 White male who was very good looking as a young single man in the early to mid 1980&rsquo;s. Not bragging, but I was told I could be a male model. Plus I am feminine looking in a pretty boy way. Well, there were always plenty of women after me, but it always freaked me out how many guys were too. A very large number of these guys were *not gay at all*. Many were married, had girlfriends and even had kids. Some were macho, even cops. I got to the point where I was paranoid even to make friends with guys anymore. </p>
<p>So I can say that in the early to mid 80&rsquo;s in the Los Angeles area male bisexuality was epidemic. In particular, I lived and worked for a while in the Hollywood/Beverly Hills area, and there it was actually considered odd or even quaint to be completely str8. It seems this behavior was particularly epidemic amongst males aged say 23-30 or so. I really think that young White men need to get married or get a steady girlfriend, as they can&rsquo;t seem to handle being single. Their sex drive is so high and if they are not getting constant sex, at least nowadays, they are just going to have opportunistic sex with other males, *especially if they get to play the male role*. Men this age are so horny it seems like they will have sex with anything that moves. Most of these guys later got married, had kids, and pretty much cut it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sorry that our society has so legitimized bisexuality that so many young White guys are doing this stuff.</p>

<p>Alan, my friends and I got quite a chuckle out of your post.  White men sneaking around with Nubian goddesses for fear of losing their jobs?  Get real, this isn&rsquo;t 1950.  We&rsquo;re all single guys in our 20s and none of us are sneaking around lusting after forbidden black fruit.  Black women just aren&rsquo;t viewed by a great deal of white men as being attractive, plain and simple.  When we spot a some girls with a black friend, we make comments about how pretty the girls are but none of us ever comment on the black girl.  When we go over and talk we&rsquo;ll be nice to her but only because we want to make an impression with her friends and score.</p>
<p>I suggest you keep your comments to phone in on some black radio station.   </p>

<p>Those guys were probably gay or at the very least bisexual. Just because a guy gets married does not mean he is straight.</p>

<p>In 2000, I had a sister in law who found out her husband was bisexual. She came home one afternoon and found in bed with a young recently married man. The man was a 26 year old Asian man.</p>

<p>There are studies that show the majority of people are bisexual.  In ancient times bisexuality was common and it was the Christians who forbid it and called it sin and it was taboo for almost 2000 years.  Because society doesn&rsquo;t morally condemn bisexuality anymore, the younger generation is engaging in it more than ever.</p>
