						<p>National and state estimates by race, Hispanic origin, sex and age released by the U.S. Census Bureau also show that the Hispanic population exceeded 500,000 in 16 states.</p>
<p>Hispanics remained the largest minority group, with blacks (single race or multiracial) second at 40.7 million in 2007. The black population exceeded 500,000 in 20 states. Blacks were the largest minority group in 24 states, compared with 20 states in which Hispanics were the largest minority group.</p>
<p>{snip} The population of whites (single race and not of Hispanic origin) totaled 199.1 million .</p>
<p>With a 3.3 percent increase between July 1, 2006, and July 1, 2007, Hispanics were the fastest-growing minority group. Asians were the second fastest-growing minority group, with a 2.9 percent population increase during the period. The white population grew by 0.3 percent during the one-year period.</p>
<p>Overall, the nation&rsquo;s minority population reached 102.5 million in 2007 &mdash; 34 percent of the total. California had a minority population of 20.9 million &mdash; 20 percent of the nation&rsquo;s total, Texas had a minority population of 12.5 million &mdash; 12 percent of the U.S. total.</p>
<p>Four states and the District of Columbia were &#8220;majority-minority&#8221; (i.e., more than 50 percent of their population is made up of people other than single-race non-Hispanic whites). Hawaii led the nation with a population that was 75 percent minority in 2007, followed by the District of Columbia (68 percent), New Mexico (58 percent), California (57 percent) and Texas (52 percent). Next in line, though not majority-minority, were Nevada, Maryland and Georgia, each with a minority population of 42 percent.</p>
<p>Highlights for the various groups:</p>
<p>Hispanics</p>
<p>California (13.2 million) had the largest Hispanic population of any state as of July 1, 2007, followed by Texas (8.6 million) and Florida (3.8 million). Texas had the largest numerical increase between 2006 and 2007 (308,000), followed by California (268,000) and Florida (131,000). In New Mexico, Hispanics comprised the highest proportion of the total population (44 percent), with California and Texas (36 percent each) next in line.</p>
<p>The Hispanic population in 2007 had a median age of 27.6, compared with the population as a whole at 36.6. Almost 34 percent of the Hispanic population was younger than 18, compared with 25 percent of the total population.</p>
<p>Blacks</p>
<p>The black population increased by 1.3 percent, or 540,000, between 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>New York had the largest black population in 2007 (3.5 million), followed by Florida and Texas (3 million each). Georgia had the largest numerical increase between 2006 and 2007 (84,000), with Texas (62,000) and Florida (48,000) next. In the District of Columbia, the black population comprised the highest percentage (56 percent); Mississippi (38 percent) and Louisiana (32 percent) were next.</p>
<p>The single-race black population in 2007 had a median age of 31.1, compared with the population as a whole at 36.6. About 31 percent of the black population was younger than 18, compared with 25 percent of the total population.</p>
<p><b>Asians</b></p>
<p>The Asian population rose by 2.9 percent, or 434,000, between 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asians were the largest minority group in Hawaii and Vermont.</p>
<p><b>American Indians and Alaska Natives</b></p>
<p>The American Indian and Alaska Native population rose by 1 percent or 45,000, from 2006 to 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>American Indians and Alaska Natives were the largest minority group in Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Dakota.</p>
<p><b>Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders</b></p>
<p>The Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander population rose by 1.6 percent, or 16,000, from 2006 to 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Whites</b></p>
<p>The non-Hispanic, single-race white population of 199.1 million represented 66 percent of the total population.</p>
<p>California, New York and Texas had the largest population of this group (15.6 million, 11.6 million and 11.4 million, respectively), but Texas experienced the largest numerical increase (95,000), followed by North Carolina (92,000) and Georgia (57,000). Maine (96 percent) had the highest proportion of whites, followed by Vermont (95 percent) and West Virginia (94 percent).</p>
<p>The white population in 2007 was older than the population as a whole: The respective median ages were 40.8 and 36.6. About 21 percent of the population of this group was younger than 18, compared with 25 percent of the total population.</p>

			<p>Whites are not, and probably won&rsquo;t be, a &#8220;minority&#8221; in New Mexico.</p>
<p>&#8220;White&#8221; is not just blonde-haired, fair-skinned Nordics, but also people of Southern European descent. Many people in New Mexico are descended of some of the first Spanish settlers who came and established presidios and missions in New Mexico.</p>
<p>In Albuquerque and Santa Fe, there are many, many White Spanish people who have lived in the state for generations. These people are fiercely proud of the Spanish ancestry and will say so. </p>
<p>Whites are a definite majority in New Mexico, followed by mestizos, then American Indians. </p>

			<p>Yes, but a large portion of these are illegals or legal non-citizens. This is why a depression may be good in one respect, millions of these illegals and others will be forced to go home because they can&rsquo;t find work or there may be more work in Mexico because we are sending them our jobs. </p>

			<p>America is now thoroughly riddled with pockets of almost exclusively Hispanic &#8220;immigrant&#8221; communities, wherein hardly a word of English is spoken and none perhaps the babies are native born! There are often several such areas withing the same city and many in the same states. These enclaves are about as &#8220;American&#8221; as a primitive Peruvian village. What manner of country allows this? What manner of people allow this? </p>
<p>There is no going back now. All fantasies of returning America to it&rsquo;s past glories are pure pipe-dreams.  </p>

			<p>The issue of the number of hispanics in the U.S. is incredible only in the fact that most of them are here illegally and the others were largely here illegally, before Reagans amnesty.(some 5 or more million) The majority of hispanics here have come here illegally, in other words. </p>

			<p>This is a lot of fun. Next time you are talking with a young person explain to them the census reveals the total number of Mexicans in the USA in 1930 were 1,422,533 out of a population of 122,775,046 making the percentage of Mexicans here 1.16% of the total US population.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until after the federal Bracero Program of 1942 to import Mexicans as labor to drive down wages of Americans working the fields that they really arrived in material numbers.</p>
<p>I dare you. See if they believe you or if instead they argue with you calling you a racist and saying you cannot possibly be right. Be sure to print out the 1930 census (you can get a link to it at census.gov from The Paleo Conservatist latest article) so you can show it to them. </p>
<p>Lol.. you&rsquo;ll be 100% right and you won&rsquo;t be a racist for pointing that out and they will be 100% wrong but that&rsquo;s the state of understanding we find ourselves in today in this country.</p>
<p>The truth doesn&rsquo;t count for much anymore. </p>

			<p>Sardonicus - Your are correct about Maryland.  In the central part of the state, the hispanic and black populations are increasing rapidly with formerly White communities becoming noticeably changed in just a few years, particularly around DC, Baltimore, and as far west as Frederick. Southern Maryland is &#8220;historically black.&#8221; The Eastern Shore has &#8220;historically black&#8221; sections, and because of the rural nature of the area, hispanics go there from New Jersey and Delaware to get jobs. The White population on the Eastern Shore has increased as &#8220;White Flighters&#8221; arrive more and more from central Maryland. (I&rsquo;m moving there next month.)The Chesapeake Bay has made the Eastern Shore like a separate state whose residents care little for the &#8220;toilet&#8221; west of the Bay.  Last I heard, &#8220;the scales will tip&#8221; very soon in Maryland - like in a year.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a very good idea, and I&rsquo;m with you on that. Whites have already been a minority, however, going on 70 years now, at many city schools, and in many city neighborhoods in the country. Whites have been a minority, not just in these states, but in many cities in the country for awhile now. Ask some of the white men there how well whites-as-a-minority has gone over.</p>

			<p>It is of vital importance that America remain white by majority for the safety and the future of our people.<br>
Massive nonwhite immigration populations threaten all aspects of health, welfare, and safety and deny whites the quality of life vital to that which we have established prior to the immigration reform act of 1965.<br>
As nonwhite populations continue to rise, America is assured by the global policies of the power elite propagandists such as former North Carolina professor Kamau Kambon will take to podiums to guide the next generations nonwhite poor into open genocide against whites.<br>
America cannot afford to allow that to happen if we truly support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights bestowed upon us by or founding fathers.<br>
Immigration must be curtailed to prevent the blood of millions of white Americans from flowing into the gutters on American streets.</p>

<p>A Los Angeles judge dismissed a taxpayer lawsuit Wednesday that sought to repeal a long-standing directive prohibiting Los Angeles police officers from asking arrestees about their immigration status.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Rolf M. Treu sided with the city and the American Civil Liberties Union, which claimed there were no triable issues raised in the suit. He heard arguments on the motion June 10 and had the case under submission since then.</p>
<p>Los Angeles resident Harold P. Sturgeon filed suit in May 2006 against police Chief William J. Bratton and members of the Police Commission, seeking to have Special Order 40 declared unlawful.</p>
<p>In court papers, Sturgeon&rsquo;s lawyers called Special Order 40 &ldquo;essentially a &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rsquo; policy regarding illegal aliens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sturgeon asked for a permanent injunction preventing taxpayer money from being used to enforce it. He and other critics said the 28-year-old mandate from the Los Angeles City Council hampers the LAPD&rsquo;s ability to exchange information with federal immigration officials.</p>
<p>The order is intended to avoid discouraging illegal immigrants from reporting crimes and assisting police.</p>
<p>In their court papers, lawyers for the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office maintained the directive does not prevent the LAPD from working closely with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no evidence &hellip; to show that ICE has ever complained that they have not had the assistance of LAPD, or that LAPD has not come when they are called,&rdquo; the city&rsquo;s court papers state.</p>
<p>In their court papers, ACLU lawyers maintained that Special Order 40 is consistent with federal law and not in conflict with it.<br>

			<p>&#8220;The non-Hispanic, single-race white population of 199.1 million represented 66 percent of the total population.&#8221;</p>
<p>That may be the case but people of European ancestry are about 61% with the rest being people with semitic origins.  Forget 2050, European derived peoples will be a minority in the US in about 25 years.  Action needs to be taken now and all illegal aliens need to be deported and legal immigration skewed towards historical population groups.  Going by statistics that say the White vote is 80% (75% European and 5% other) of the electorate, that means there&rsquo;s a great deal of nonwhite noncitizens living in the country.  Just removing all the illegal mestizos would restore America&rsquo;s demographic profile back to early 1980s ratios.</p>
