						<p>Democrat Barack Obama opposes three state ballot measures which would end affirmative action in Colorado, Arizona, and Nebraska. Republican John McCain, by contrast, continues to take no position, according to a campaign spokesperson.</p>
<p>The McCain campaign&rsquo;s reluctance to take a stance after multiple requests from ABC News has led Ward Connerly, the proponent of the measures, to say that the presumptive Republican nominee is missing an opportunity to draw a sharp contrast with his Democratic rival.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Senator Obama has to be careful, as he opposes our initiatives, that he not be seen as an anti-white male kind of candidate,&#8221; said Connerly. &#8220;White males typically vote, probably 70/30 in favor of these initiatives. If Sen. Obama isn&rsquo;t careful, he can get saddled with the impression, the image, of being an angry black man, despite the soothing rhetoric that he uses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Connerly, who has led efforts which ended race- and gender-based affirmative action in California and Michigan, contributed $500 to Obama&rsquo;s campaign on Feb. 28. He made this donation even though the Illinois Democrat lent his voice to a 2006 radio ad seeking to defeat Connerly&rsquo;s ballot measure in the Wolverine State.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama lost Connerly&rsquo;s backing on June 10 when the Illinois Democrat came out against Connerly&rsquo;s Civil Rights Initiatives in DeWayne Wickham&rsquo;s U.S.A. Today column. The presumptive Democratic nominee wants to continue race-based affirmative action in higher education while also supporting the creation of affirmative action for low-income students regardless of race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Connerly&rsquo;s initiative will appear on the November ballot in Colorado, a state which is expected to be closely contested between the presidential candidates. The nation&rsquo;s most prominent affirmative action foe expects voters in Arizona and Nebraska to see similar measures on their general-election ballot once signatures qualify.</p>
<p>Voters in the Rocky Mountain State will also weigh in on an alternative measure which would protect affirmative action. If both measures win majority support, the one with more votes becomes law.</p>

			<p>Affirmative Action has nothing to do with it&hellip; Obama comes across as a liar and a phony. With the additional handicap of being viewed as a racist, as is his wife. If that&rsquo;s not enough to get an INTELLIGENT voter to reject him, Obama has nothing in the way of real experience, political astuteness or understanding of international diplomacy to recommend him either.</p>

			<p>Has anyone else wondered if all that media hype, all that claimed support for Obama is really true? One gets the distinct impression that much of Obama&rsquo;s support is mythical rather than real. Hyped up by the media to brainwash the guillible into voting for him. </p>

			<p>  This proves once again that John McCain does not have the instincts of a good politician. If your opponent supports some policy that is highly unpopular, does it take Einstein&rsquo;s brain to figure out that your best bet is to oppose it wholeheartedly (if you can do it with a reasonable amount of sincerity)?</p>
<p>  Same situation as that with ANWR, where Obama opposes any oil drilling, supposedly so the caribou won&rsquo;t be disturbed, and McCain says, &#8220;Me, too.&#8221; McCain did bend a little on off-shore drilling, saying he would allow states to make up their own minds. Does anyone think they won&rsquo;t all say &#8220;No,&#8221; absent a federal mandate? John McCain seems to prefer being the &#8220;parfit gentil knight&#8221; to being elected president.</p>

			<p><i>Republican John McCain, by contrast, continues to take no position, according to a campaign spokesperson.</i></p>
<p>And this is why so many will take no position when voting for McCain vs Obama.  I&rsquo;ll likely vote for Ron Paul.   McCain in many ways would be worse than Obama.  </p>

<p>When I see statements such as this I can&rsquo;t help but wonder why the majority must conform and kowtow to the minority.  With the minority being nearly devoid of personal responsibility, these handouts just prove to the rest of the world that the U.S. is inferior academically.  Which is just the beginning of lowered standards; expect it in more of your tax dollars being &#8220;lost&#8221;, a relaxation of &#8220;prison overcrowding&#8221;, an &#8220;easing of the racist criminal justice system&#8221;, and &#8220;a sudden influx of violent crime&#8221; that the media will not make aware the races of perp and victim.  </p>
<p>The Obamanation liberals are screaming for is indeed trouble on the horizon.     <br>

<p>No, he&rsquo;s &#8220;missing&#8221; an opportunity to get sucked in to a no-win situation. Any position McCain takes on these measures, <i>whether or not he agrees with them,</i> would be akin to riding a pogo stick in a minefield.</p>

			<p>If the Republicans cared for white America as much as Democrats care for non-white America, then the affirmative action debate would be joined by McCain. He is AWOL on the most important issue there can be in any election: Which group, or groups, controls the nation?</p>

			<p>I continue to be amazed at the pass that blacks get where the subject of racism is concerned. Everyone in American, EVERYONE, knows that if a white candidate running for President had been found to have been attending a racist church for some twenty years and got married by the racist pastor of that church  &mdash; , he would have to immediately step down. His aspirations for President would be over, his political career ruined. Yet millions of Democrats and some others excuse Candidate Obama, for this very behavior. The hypocricy is astounding, at least it is to me.</p>

			<p>  My analysis of all this is pretty simple. My goal is just to live in a White World. Not that I have anything against other races or wish them ill, I simply believe that the quality of my life improves in a world that is as White as possible.<br>
   I have a feeling that most people believe this to be the case, yet are terrified to utter it in public, and we all feel that niether major candidate will any longer actively represent White interests. This version of democracy is leaving Whites out in the cold and we know it. <br>
   Maybe some voters will choose McCain simply because he is the physically &#8220;Whiter&#8221; of the two front runners. However niether candidate will improve the world Whites live in.</p>

			<p>Face it, we white men are outnumbered. </p>
<p>Affirmative Action creates privileges for hispanics, blacks,  and women (white and otherwise). That&rsquo;s called a majority, my friends. Worse yet, it&rsquo;s one that doesn&rsquo;t include us.  </p>
<p>Many of you worry that you&rsquo;re about to lose the country soon. Sorry to break this to you: but you&rsquo;ve already lost it. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Republican John McCain, by contrast, continues to take no position, according to a campaign spokesperson.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a reason Sam Francis called them the &#8220;The Stupid Party.&#8221;</p>
<p>The McCainiac   &mdash;   like most Grand Ol&rsquo; Men of the Grand Ol&rsquo; Party   &mdash;   actually has a long record of supporting affirmative action. But a smart politician would at least lie   &mdash;   like he is currently doing on amnesty   &mdash;   to bring in new votes and differentiate himself from his opponent.</p>
<p>McCain reminds me of the Dole/Kemp ticket in 1996. Happy to be  a loser as long as they are liked by the media.</p>
<p>We have no business voting for either anti-white party. The only honorable options are Barr or Baldwin.</p>

			<p>Affirmative action was created and is ferociously enforced by white male federal judges.</p>
<p>The real enemy is the white male elite. The blacks, feminazis and hispanics are just the storm troopers while the white male elite stays safe in the reichklanklazi.</p>
<p>As far as those anti affirmative action initiatives go, they will pass.  But nothing will change because;</p>
<p>(1) there is no enforcement provision built in.</p>
<p>(2) The fair employment practices state and county commissions that should enforce the new anti affirmative action law employs only minorities and vicious hateful white feminazis.</p>
<p>(3)  Federal no whites need apply laws and federal judges supersede state laws.</p>
<p>(4) Federal judges are determined to destroy whites by denying us any employment at all.</p>
<p>Proposition 209 in California&rsquo;s 1996 election was a wonderful success.  It won by almost 60 percent.  But it was never enforced.  It is totally ignored.  There are fewer whites in government jobs than there were in 1996.  One can go an entire year in S. California and not see a single white employee except in a law office, a stockbroker&rsquo;s office or an entertainment industry area.</p>

			<p>He won&rsquo;t be recognized as being anti-white by the masses.  <br>
I&rsquo;m still shaking my head over his campaign platform, which consists of &#8220;change.&#8221;  It sounds like something from a high school class president race.  Someone said that Obama is the American Idol candidate, and I wholeheartedly agree.  At this point it&rsquo;s merely a popularity contest, and the children are all supporting popular guy.  McCain, although deeply flawed, is an adult.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly Humphrey offered to eat the bill itself if quotas could be &#8220;found&#8221; in it. Of course the bill did not explicitly mention quotas, but conservatives who pointed out that quotas were the inevitable result of the legislation were completely right. Humphrey was a liar and a scoundrel; so far as I know he never expressed regret at any aspect of the nation-destroying agenda he helped to promote.</p>
