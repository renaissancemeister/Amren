						<p>The Dallas Housing Authority provides rent-assistance vouchers to about 17,000 families. Nearly 8,000 more are on a waiting list, a backlog so massive that the agency quit taking new applications four years ago.</p>
<p>So why does it also have 500 special rent vouchers going unused?</p>
<p>DHA boss Ann Lott says some on the list have tried to use the vouchers &mdash; which are reserved for blacks willing to move to predominantly white areas &mdash; but couldn&rsquo;t find landlords to accept them. Some families have bad credit or poor rental histories.</p>
<p>Others on the list have declined the vouchers, telling DHA they don&rsquo;t want to move far from relatives and churches. And families without cars struggle with the lack of public transportation in some suburbs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DHA is required under a court settlement to offer the vouchers, which pay part of a family&rsquo;s rent plus application fees and deposits.</p>
<p>Mike Daniel, a Dallas lawyer who represented plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led to the settlement, said he believes there are plenty of African-American families ready to live in predominantly white areas. He said the agency has not worked hard enough to find them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 500 unused vouchers are what remains of a pool of 3,205 required under a 1995 order that led to the settlement.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer, who is now retired, ordered the DHA to build that many units of housing in predominantly white areas.</p>
<p>The agency was met with strong neighborhood resistance, and the court later agreed to allow vouchers instead.</p>
<p>DHA vouchers</p>
<p>Seven black residents sued the Dallas Housing Authority, the city and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1985, alleging that Dallas&rsquo; public housing for blacks was segregated and substandard. Former U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer agreed and required the following through a series of court orders and settlements:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;The DHA must help 3,205 black families rent homes in predominantly white areas.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised you can still &#8216;discriminate&rsquo; on the basis of bad credit or poor rental histories, though I suspect that&rsquo;s about to change.</p>

			<p>I asked my mother once what a chump was. She said, &#8220;That`s a guy who stands on a corner in the rain muttering, If he`s not here in another hour  then he can borrow the ten grand from somebody else!&#8221;  Searching to have to find someone to give money and vouchers away to  and then having them sue you anyway sounds like it pretty much fits the mark. </p>

			<p>DHA is required under a court settlement</p>
<p><br>
And that really is the heart of the matter.  Our courts are used as a tool against us, in a way that would NEVER pass muster with an elected body.</p>
<p>As racial realists this is where we should focus our energies first.  With judicial reform, many of the problems of the past could be reversed, at least in areas where like minded people were concentrated.</p>
<p>If the final decision were up to law MAKERS instead of unelected, unaccountable judges, this problem would only exist in liberal areas. And those areas wouldn&rsquo;t remain liberal for long, once the tremendous differences in quality of life became apparent.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to live in a White neighborhood, you need to live in a White state.  Our Enemies will launch Blacks at us like cruise missiles, targeted to do the most damage possible.  </p>

<p>Why are whites always seen as the solution.  Why didn&rsquo;t the judge order vouchers for blacks to move to a predominantly Asian area, or Latino area?  Or why doesn&rsquo;t the judge order vouchers for poor white liberals who are willing to move into predominantly black areas.<br>

<p>If it were within my power, I&rsquo;d have this jerk living in the projects in the middle of the ghetto, so he could get a better understanding about what the real world is all about.</p>
<p>He probably retired in a community that&rsquo;s all white, probably within the confines of a walled community with a guarded entrance.</p>
<p>More than the blacks themselves, it is leftist miscreants like this one who are undoubtedly the biggest enemies to White middleclass America&hellip;..ever.</p>

<p>Great. The &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement was among other things a repeal of the right of white people to exempt themselves from black crime, degeneracy and generalized truculence. Here in Chicagoland, where the nicer northern suburbs (like mine) are under government orders to increase &#8220;low cost&#8221; housing, we&rsquo;re seeing a dramatic increase in the number of fresh-from-the-ghetto blacks prowling our streets and sidewalks. These aren&rsquo;t Cosby Kids but people who were quite obviously living in some black ghetto mere months ago.</p>
<p>The governing assumption of these &#8220;programs&#8221; is that white people somehow discover where the &#8220;good&#8221; neighborhoods are, through illicit means of some kind, move there, and then conspire to keep blacks out of &#8220;good&#8221; neighborhoods. The obvious truth that no neighborhood is any better or worse than the people in it never occurs to cretins like Mike Daniel.<br>

			<p>Haven&rsquo;t these elitists destroyed enough White neighborhoods, whole city blocks and whole towns and cities with their never ending communist anti-white tactics?</p>
<p> How much longer are we going to tolerate being displaced from our WHOLE country?? Where is the backbone our people used to have? In the dust bin of history? Is this all we have to look forward to? A utopia made in HELL? Shame on us all!</p>

<p>This mandate to move black people to a predominantly white area is multiculturalism at its best&hellip;(sic)  </p>

			<p>Section 8 is exhibit A that the U.S. govt is out to deliberately destroy White communities and destroy our quality of life, and that Blacks and other minorities are their unwitting shock troops.</p>

			<p>What they&rsquo;re doing is sowing the seeds of a major conflict between race.  It creates a lot of pressure between people to be forcibly intergrated and when that force is gone, people just revert back to their old ways.  </p>
<p><br>
Now white people will not act against society in a concerted effort until the cost of not acting rises above the benefit of the status quo.  White people have a lot more to lose by getting involved in racial politics in terms of lost time with family, societal ostracism, lost wages from working etc. than blacks who don&rsquo;t either value those aforementioned things or are beyond hope </p>
<p>Its like that song, when you dont got nuthin you got nuthin to lose.  But I think there will be a tipping point.  With the economy losing steam, I think you will see some definite different societal dynamics in the very near future.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget about middle or even upper class white liberals&hellip; encouraging them to move into black or hispanic or even predominantly asian neighborhoods. Let&rsquo;s make it happen. It would just be wrong to exclude them from diversity. </p>

			<p>This is already happening to the Detroit suburbs at alarming rates, and these blacks like said before in a post are not Cosby kids, they are ghetto talking, do rag wearing threats. In my area, an eastern suburb of Detroit, there are many homes up for sale and when the owner cannot sell them, the owner rents the home out and guess who is moving in? The Boyz from the hood.</p>

			<p>If (whites) are so bad why is it the ULTIMATE step up for these blacks  to, go to school with whites, live with whites, shop with whites? ? If whites are so bad why are 90% of all inventions from white minds? Have these blacks (ever) even considered doing anything for THEMSELVES? They just had flooding in the predominately (white) midwest comparable in many ways to the flooding in New Orleans, yet no stores were ransacked, no rapes took place, no whites were laying on the roof of their homes crying &#8220;We Needs Hep&#8221; why, the answer is obvious if you are not too afraid to even think it. No amount of affirmative action can ever raise a Sows Ear into a Silk Purse.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like to take those rich white liberals out of their gated enclaves and make them live for just one year (if they last that long) in a place like south-central L.A. THEN see how anxious they are to spend more time in &#8220;diversified&#8221; neighborhoods. They should live with the misery they cause the rest of us. If they have to deal with these thugs and animals in their natural setting maybe they won&rsquo;t be so quick to shove them down our throats anymore.</p>

			<p>Maybe the blacks don&rsquo;t want to live in the white neighborhoods in Texas because in Texas you are legally allowed to shoot those who steal from you.</p>

			<p>I surprised that any &#8220;White neighborhoods&#8221; still exist, except for the exclusive ones like Judge Jerry Buchmeyer lives in? I thought the court predominately destroyed them thru housing laws so that like busing there&rsquo;s very to take from Whites?</p>

			<p>I think the diversity loving white liberals should be forced to move into the ghetoos &amp; clean them up!  Whoever&rsquo;s brillant idea this is, should be willing to live in the bad areas &amp; maybe they might changed their opinion on diversity! </p>

			<p>Funny how blacks want to live in White areas but never the reverse. That says a great deal. By the way as a former landlord I can assure you that blacks are the worst tenants you can ever have.</p>
