						<p>U.S. officials announced plans for more high-tech border fencing and rules making it harder for federal contractors to hire illegal workers, but said on Monday it would take another three years to declare victory in immigration control.</p>
<p>In an election-year update on immigration policies &mdash; a simmering issue in this year&rsquo;s presidential campaign &mdash; the Republican Bush administration said its control efforts were making progress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The administration instead imposed a patchwork of administrative measures and moved ahead with plans to construct 670 miles (1,070 km) of barriers along the 2,000-mile (3,200 km) border with Mexico.</p>
<p>Chertoff said the government had decided to award Boeing Co contracts to build two sections of a high-tech fence in Arizona.</p>
<p>The new sections would be an &ldquo;operational configuration&rdquo; of a much-criticized 28-mile (45-km) &ldquo;virtual fence&rdquo; built by Boeing and tested earlier, Chertoff said.</p>
<p>It would include fixed towers, radar and ground sensors, remote control cameras, and software linking border agents. Officials plan to deploy elements of the technology as needed elsewhere along the border.</p>
<p>Chertoff dismissed earlier reports of deep trouble with the test section, which had been delayed by several months due to technical problems, including communications and software glitches and fuzzy video images.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

					<p>Just like kids or adults, who sit around all day playing &#8220;virtual games&#8221; and feeling at the end of the session that they have accomplished something, so is the situation with &#8220;virtual fences&#8221; and the people who play around with them. A fence of any kind, virtual or real, is useless without boots on the ground to back it up. I can imagine the operators of the &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; eating snacks and counting the numbers of illegal aliens who get through as a kind of way to pass the time at work. This administration like previous ones on the illegal immgration issue are quite simply traitors.</p>

					<p>I am OK with a virtual fence just as long as there is a double row fence next to it.  Let&rsquo;s face it, a real fence would be the best $4 billion investment this country ever made.  </p>

					<p>Do new banks put up the cameras first? No, they build really good walls to protect whats inside. Cameras protect nothing, deter almost nothing, and come last, just icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Looks like Chertoff thinks all icing and no cake is a good idea. Must have skipped home economics. Or never visited a bank. Must have skipped law enforcement classes, too. </p>
<p>Doing it a second time and then expecting different results&hellip;</p>

					<p>Virtual border fence is like an alarm system in a building without locks on the door. It is destined to not impede the smooth flow of &#8220;cheap&#8221; laborers through the American-Mexican border. It will be completely useless to stop the invading masses should they decide to violate the border in millions. If this happen, show me a government official who will authorize a use of force of any kind against (pregnant) womwn and children that will surely be used by the invaders as human shields.<br>

					<p>A <span class="caps">VIRTUAL FENCE, </span>we wanted a real fence to keep these illegal aliens out.  Since it is easy to get in, other problems are developing.  In Southern California there is a problem with Mexican cheese made from un pasturized milk that is spreading a drug resistant strain of TB to the population.  In the <span class="caps">USA, </span>we have not had tuberculin cows for over 100 years.  </p>

					<p>More opium for the conservative masses. </p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the point of having fences with so many <span class="caps">LEGAL </span>immigrants pouring into the country? Legal immigrants are worse than the illegal ones. At least the illegals stick to themselves.</p>
<p>These fences are simply going to help legitimize the massive flow of legal immigrants into the country; and more importantly help protect the neoliberal estabslishment from a major backlash.</p>

					<p>I will believe in the effectiveness of &#8220;virtual fences&#8221; when the US Government puts them up around the following facilities in lieu of physical fencing / barriers:</p>
<p>The White House<br>
Federal prisons<br><br>
Nuclear power plants<br><br>
Military installations<br><br>
<span class="caps">CIA </span>headquarters<br><br>
The &#8220;Green Zone&#8221; in Bagdad<br><br>
Andrews Air Force Base</p>
<p>Virtual fencing is desired by the President Bush and Chertoff because it does not work most of the time and they know it.  It is an expensive scam being foisted upon the American people.  As for an effective fence design the East Germans designed on years ago that was simple and it worked&hellip;the high, slick concrete design.  </p>
<p>Even the standard 12 foot high wire border fence can be scaled with a ladder bought from Home Depot.  Why just 12 feet high???  Again, they do not want it to be too effective.</p>

					<p>Great post, Skipper!</p>
<p>I might add&hellip;  How about replacing all of the real fences around Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s mansions with &#8220;virtual&#8221; fences since she thinks real fences are such a &#8220;terrible idea&#8221;?  </p>
<p>In fact, all of our &#8220;elected representatives&#8221; should follow suit.  Then they&rsquo;d soon learn how well &#8220;virtual&#8221; fences stop &#8220;virtual&#8221; illegal immigration from &#8220;virtually&#8221; entering our &#8220;virtual&#8221; nation!</p>

					<p>Surely, the answer is a forty foot high brick and stone wall, stretching the entire length of the US-Mexico border. Every hundred yards is a tower, with searchlights. The wall would be manned 24 hours a day, 365 days a year by the US Border Patrol and detachments of the the military.They would all be armed and authorised to use force to repel invaders. The problem would soon go away.</p>
<p>That, not some cockamamie &#8220;virtual&#8221; fence, is the answer.   </p>

					<p>I have seen a picture of one of the border &#8220;fences&#8221; located in remote rural areas.</p>
<p>It is a line of 4 ft bollards abotu 2 feet apart.  Obviously a vehicle cannot cross the bollards.</p>
<p>But all the smugglers have to do is drive a bus to one side of the line of bollards, the illegals walk through and a bus picks them up on the other side.</p>
<p>Or have you seen the fences used in San Diego, Brownsville and other urban areas.  The are 8  by 4 ft pieces of steel that have ridges and hollows.  These pieces are supposed to be placed vertically, so no one can use the riges as hand holds and the hollows as a ladder.</p>
<p>But these &#8220;fences&#8221; have the steel placed horizontally so it is as easy to climb up the fence as it is to climb a ladder.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Excuse my Canadian ignorance&hellip;but what the hell is a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; fence? Never heard of such nonsense in my life&#8221;</p>
<p>You right, it is nonsence. A &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; is electronic sensors put along the border that are supposed to detect motion(ie.illegals) going across it. There is no actual physical barrier such as a real fence hence the term &#8220;virual fence&#8221;. It will do a real good job of keeping our virtual illegals as well as all of the  virtual crime and drugs <span class="caps">LOL.</span></p>
