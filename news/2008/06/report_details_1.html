<h1><a href="http://my.att.net/s/editorial.dll?eeid=5955692&amp;eetype=article&amp;render=y&amp;ck=">Report Details Shooting Death of NC Student Leader</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Estes Thompson, AP, June 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eve Carson was shot four other times, according to the report from the Office of the State Medical Examiner that simply lists her cause of death as &#8220;multiple gunshot wounds.&#8221; The 22-year-old from Athens, Ga., was found March 5 lying on a street not far from the university&rsquo;s campus.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have charged two Durham men &mdash; Laurence Lovette, 17, and Demario Atwater, 22 &mdash; with first-degree murder in her death. Lovette and another man are also charged with the January murder of Duke University graduate student Abhijit Mahato.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report [on Carson&rsquo;s death] said Carson was shot five times, including once in the right cheek by a &#8220;full metal jacketed bullet&#8221; and in the right shoulder by a similar bullet that penetrated her right lung and traveled into her small intestine. She was also shot in the right upper arm and in the right buttock.</p>
<p>But the most vicious wound came from a shotgun blast that struck her right hand before impacting her head and brain, where the medical examiner recovered a &#8220;numerous birdshot pellets and a plastic shot cup.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The autopsy report said Carson was wearing a light gray T-shirt, dark blue sweat pants and light blue, gray and white athletic shoes at the time of her death. She was also wearing a yellow metal necklace with a small locket and a white paper wristband on her left wrist that said &#8220;Be true&#8221; and &#8220;Nike.&#8221;</p>
<p>In court documents released last week, authorities said a confidential informant told police that Atwater said he and Lovette entered Carson&rsquo;s home through an open door, took her and her vehicle to an ATM, and ended up withdrawing about $1,400 over two days. Investigators confirmed the dollar figure by reviewing Carson&rsquo;s bank records, according to the records.</p>
<p>The informant also said Carson was shot by both suspects. An affidavit signed by an investigator said the informant&rsquo;s statements were corroborated because two separate weapons were used in the shooting.</p>
<p>Lovette and Stephen Oates, 19, of Durham, are charged in Mahato&rsquo;s death. His autopsy showed the 29-year-old had been shot once at point-blank range in the forehead.</p>

<p>God, let it happen that these two are publicly hung.</p>
<p>Hanging them publicly would help satisfy the broken-hearted ones who knew Eve, and would actually put these two out of their misery, which, for them, is called &#8220;life.&#8221; </p>

			<p>The race war continues and most whites are the only ones that doesn&rsquo;t know it exist.The media is also responsible for the millions of black on white crimes by failing to report it. Do you think there would be the victims they are now if whites knew the truth? No,they would be alert of the danger and would be on their guard!</p>

			<p>Obviously, the shotgun blast through the hand and into the head indicates this was an execution, especially if the wad was lodged in her head. This woman was obviously tortured, then executed without remorse. Why else would they shoot her in the buttock?</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am deeply disturbed about the lack of details. There seems to be a bout of secrecy involving Eva&rsquo;s murder. I guess the AP does not want to get Whites upset if they knew the truth.</p>

			<p>And why did they commit such atrocious murders?</p>
<p>Because, of course, the left wing whackos in this country, the Jeremiah Wright types, Jesse and Al types, plus almost the entire black community, are all of the opinion that blacks should hate whites, because it is whites who oppress them.  That&rsquo;s all they talk about.   Yes, they preach hatred of whites.</p>
<p>After listening to the talking black heads on television condoning the evil, racist, anti-white hatred spewed by this Wright, isn&rsquo;t it quite evident that the vast majority of high profile blacks are guilty of spreading racial hatred and causing stupid young blacks to want to kill and torture whites and other non-blacks?</p>
<p>How many other white killings, maimings and rapes are these people going to be guilty of before they&rsquo;re going to be held accountable for their evil manipulations?</p>

			<p>It seems that the degree of outrage over a senseless murder is directly proportional to the status of the victim as compared to the criminal who played God and deprived the individual of a life.</p>
<p>Irrespective of various religious proclamations, the only life that we are absolutely certain of is the one that we enjoy here. Life, at least on this earth is temporary at best, death is eternal. </p>
<p>So here, we have two African - Americans who feel entitled to destroy a truly beautiful, gifted young white woman. What this society needs to ask itself is just why these two louts would feel that way - and what society needs to do to try to insure that other similarly situated whites are not summarily executed simply for the entertainment of their &#8220;politically correct&#8221; executioners.       </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite sure that there are a lot of white males around who would dearly wish to be left alone with these two young men for a discussion without the threat of criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>I, for one, would begin the discussion with gentlemen there are two of you, one of me, and no one is armed. I am three times older than either one of you, so the odds are in your favor! However, I am going to kill you both within the next ten minutes,  the only way you two can continue to live is to kill me - so take your best shot! But you need to understand that if you do win there is a long line of white men outside waiting to take my place!</p>
<p>What in the hell is wrong with this country?</p>

			<p>Is it possible that the reason she left her door unlocked, was because she was not aware of the serious danger posed to anyone, especially White females, living in close proximity to blacks? If Whites only knew about the un-announced race war, then they might take more precautions, but the MSM does not do its job.</p>

			<p>Another black racist hate murder, buried by the MSM to protect our delicate liberal attitudes toward racial reality.</p>
<p>In a way, Eve Carson herself might have been a victim of this PC brainwashing. If she had a realistic view, she might have had a pistol and been safe behind a locked door. Instead, she was easy pickings for the jackels and hyenas.</p>

<p>I have a question:</p>
<p>Was she killed the night they kidnapped her?  The reason I ask is the part above that says they &#8220;ended up withdrawing about    $1, 400 over two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does any know?</p>
<p>If she was kidnapped and held for two days before being murdered you know what that means.</p>
<p>These two ought to be turned inside out over a very long period of time.</p>

			<p> Most groups of people under attack would go into defensive mode. But she was in college and they teach the liberal tripe. There really doesn,t seem to be much future or hope for white people unless there is some CHANGE. This is sad and should reported to the whole country. But the only place you,ll find it on a few websites. Anybody have a couple of other good sites on the web.</p>

			<p>This kind of killing is disturbing.  Traditionally, it is white murderers who plan and kill viciously  &mdash;  black murderers have historically committed emotional crimes.  Things are changing, or at least they are in the media.</p>

			<p>GREAT!  Now we know the color of everything she was wearing at the time of her murder, all the way down to her yellow necklace and white paper wristband.  They even go so far as to tell us what the wristband said and which wrist it was attached to.  Yet they continue to have difficulty providing the public with the description of suspects.  As we read recently in the 1958 article from Time, this is an intentional ploy to keep minority crime rates from the public.  The excuse, we are told, is that the race of suspects are irrelevant when in comes to the story.  My response to this is that its more relevant than the color of her necklace and wristband, for crying out loud!  Is there any question left as to the primary motive of their silence, or in most other cases, the lack of details pertaining to suspect descriptors?  To do so in every instance would expose their multicultural, utopian lie for the scam that it is.  Their silence speaks volumes!</p>

<p>Good one - LMAO!  As if the media give a damn about White people&rsquo;s opinions.  White people don&rsquo;t riot at the drop of a hat, as blacks do when they perceive the slightest &#8220;insult&#8221; coming from the MSM.</p>
<p>No, the lack of details is designed to prevent afro-boycotts, &#8220;youths&#8221; rioting in the streets, and to keep the black race hustlers away.  </p>
<p>White people are of no concern to the MSM.  It&rsquo;s disturbing that so many otherwise intelligent people have no idea what&rsquo;s going on here.    </p>

<p>I would love to believe that.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;re in this position IN SPITE OF the fact - that we all already have as good an idea as we need to have.</p>
<p>Though I was both a victim of, and witness to, Black on White violence by the time I was 12, my life changed forever when, in 1974 (mark the date) I saw 20 Blacks chase down one of our towns prettiest girls and beat her.  She was two years older than me.  It was so sick and insane.  She was in the hospital for three months.  She came back to school a year later and the guilty party, another girl who started it all, was sent to a Reformatory school and no one ever saw her again.</p>
<p>But what made my blood run cold was the feeling of helplessness AND the feeling of &#8220;So what?&#8221; indifference among the Whites.  Plus, I came from a family with a liberal mother and big time crazy communist older brother who routinely beat me.  My mother waited until the last week of her life to apologize to me and my brother is, what Michael Levin says of Blacks in one of his great articles for AR, unrepentent and full of himself.</p>

<p>Eve Carson&rsquo;s Final Minutes</p>
<p>By Mike Nizza<br/>
INSERT DESCRIPTIONEve Carson (Jim Stratford/Courtesy of U.N.C., via AP)</p>
<p>Over the objections of defense lawyers, a North Carolina judge today released several documents that add more details on the final moments of Eve Carson, the slain student body president at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>While medical tests did not reveal any evidence of sexual assault, the police obtained an account of the crimes from a confidential informant who spoke to one of the two suspects before they were arrested. Here&rsquo;s what Demario Atwater, one of the suspects, told the informant, according to The News &amp; Observer:</p>
<p>    * Ms. Carson was not carjacked as originally suspected. Instead, the two suspects, Mr. Atwater and Lawrence Alvin Lovett Jr., took her from her home. They entered through an open door.<br/>
    * The three departed in her Toyota Highlander for an A.T.M., where they used her pin number to withdraw cash.<br/>
    * Then both suspects shot her to death in a street near her home. Neighbors reported hearing shots at 5 a.m.<br/>
    * Over the next two days, the suspects succeeded in withdrawing $1,400</p>
<p>Both suspects were charged with first degree murder in March and are currently awaiting trial.</p>
<p>And here are pics of the two &#8220;alleged&#8221; murderers:</p>

I agree with you. We can get the news by sending the AM link to everyone we know but first some posters have got to realize that some of their posts are driving away people who might be inclined to gravitate toward our cause which is the survival of Euro-Americans. Anti- Semitic diatribes accomplish nothing other than to turn people away. Jews are just as likely to be targets of Black violence as any other WHITE people. I lived for fifteen years in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood in Northeast Phila. and my neighbors were 100% White. Asians also make up a large percentage of the victims of Black crime.</p>
<p>As for Hispanics they feel obligated to be outwardly politically correct when it comes to color but trust me many don&rsquo;t have any use for Blacks.</p>
<p>We need to discuss race relations with Blacks and not the way some websites do with the crude racial references. We have some of the most intelligent, articulate and literate people here that I have ever read. We need to keep it that way. Sure let&rsquo;s vent our anger, frustration, cries for vengeance etc. with the full knowledge that these emotions are totally righteous, even the revenge but it&rsquo;s all in the delivery.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired of being a victim of black &#8216;crime&rsquo; too. Now there&rsquo;s all this Hispanic &#8216;crime&rsquo;, and yes, even some asian &#8216;crime&rsquo; now too. </p>
<p>Please, someone save me from all this &#8216;crime&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Please. I&rsquo;m not joking. Most men don&rsquo;t joke when it comes to their &#8216;crime&rsquo;.  <br/>

			<p>Just picture the insanity of Obama winning the presidency. Then watch Blacks go wild. Figuring with a brotha in the White House, they have the right to do whatever they want&hellip; or to whoever they want.</p>
<p>McCain might be a GWB Clone, but Obama bodes infinitely worse for our America. As to that frenzied effort by the Obamabots to neutralize or squelch the rumors they claim are floating all around&hellip; Kinda makes you wonder just WHICH is the truth and WHICH IS THE RUMOR. Judging by their rabid frenzy.</p>

			<p>&#8220;isn&rsquo;t it time someone starts to publish a news magazine that tells the truth about the volume of such crimes and the horror being perpetrated against whites so we can see what&rsquo;s happening in this country?&#8221;</p>
<p>I could even see there being money in that. But, magazines get paid thru advertising. Perhaps a pulp magazine? I could see there being good money in that.</p>
<p>I remember when Jared Taylor was to speak at a college campus, they submitted a small advertisement to the local newspaper, a paid advertisement, that said nothing but Jared Taylor&rsquo;s name and the date and time he was going to be giving a public speach about diversity. The paper refused to print it. Paid for. Then, a short time later, the very same newspaper, went on to write several editorials to the public about the importance of, and their commitment to, free speach. You&rsquo;ll notice AmRen doesn&rsquo;t have any paid ads supporting their website. Not even for beer or porn or credit cards or gun-clubs or tractor-pulls or whatever. <br/>

<p>Does a very good job of getting the truth out that is otherwise suppressed by the dopes/liberals in the media.  In one of the last newsletters, it states that there have been over 43,000 (rapes, murders, assaults, etc.) of white women since 2005, or within the span of just 2 years.  And we just don&rsquo;t hear about this.   This is staggering!  There have been approximately zero rapes of blacks!   </p>
<p>White people need to have a media outlet of their own.  This is simply unfair and dangerous for Whites not to know the truth.  </p>
<p>Thanks to Evil people such as Rev. LOL Wright, Sharpton, Jackson, and Afrocentric studies in Universities of Lower Learning, that is what&rsquo;s being spewed out from these thugs.  <br/>

			<p>The MSM killed Eve Carson.  They did this by constantly touting how wonderful and normal African-Americans are, and hiding the true statistics about Black on White crime.  Every reporter, announcer, journalist, screen writer and director helped to create the feeling that one should not be wary around blacks.  They killed her.</p>

			<p>It just proves what hideous monsters these people are. They have not a drop of humanity in them. How the HELL could any real human being do that to a helpless young girl? What kind of real man could do that? ONe would think that anyone but a complete psycho would find some compassion for his innocent victim. They got her ATM card, why did they have to do that to her!!!! I&rsquo;m really beginnning to believe that there are varying degrees of humanity.<br/>
Her picture and the pictures of all the victims of these horrible crimes should be plastered on every Website in this world. IT&rsquo;s time to &#8220;go to the mattresses&#8221;.<br/>
And anyone who even suggests that she got what she deserved due to her liberal ideas, should take a gun and blow his brains out.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;After listening to the talking black heads on television condoning the evil, racist, anti-white hatred spewed by this Wright, isn&rsquo;t it quite evident that the vast majority of high profile blacks are guilty of spreading racial hatred and causing stupid young blacks to want to kill and torture whites and other non-blacks&#8221;</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need any encouragement. IT&rsquo;s in their primitive natures. They look in the mirror and the hate what they see so that they have to ravish and murder someone beautiful. Eve Carson&rsquo;s blood cries out for vengeance.</p>

			<p>I cannot help but notice that there is no mention of sexual assault other than to say the report does not mention it.  If sexual assualt was involved too (which I predict it was), would THAT possibly enrage a few white fence-sitters who desperately need a rude awakening?  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also right to note that this incident occurred just a few miles (8 to be precise) from Duke University where the Lacrosse team rape hoax occurred just a few years ago.  Compare the outpouring of sentiment of these two cases, so geographically close.  The comparison is apt but especially the comparison of how the media, blacks, and the academic faculties have treated the two incidents.  </p>

			<p>Do you folks remember the photo of her posted her at AR?</p>
<p>What a knock out.  God bless the memory of this woman, whatever her politics were or however brainwashed she might have been.</p>
<p>Never the less, if she did fit that category then, I don&rsquo;t know what to say.  We all know of cases in the media, and others personally, when the victims, who survive, and their families (whether the victim survives or not) bond with their offender - just as children do when they are abused by their parents. Only, in terms of society today, we are their parents.  So its a case of being abused by children who aren&rsquo;t really yours, but are forced on you just the same.</p>
<p>But, if someone IS a product of PC indoctrination and they pass through certain neighborhoods, or talk to black men, out of fear of being called a racist; then they are asking for it as much as that man who, while on Safari in Africa with his wife and three children, got out of his Jeep to film an Up Close and Personal with a pack of wild Lions.  If you want to know what happened to the man you can see for yourself on the internet.  Just type in - &#8220;Man eaten alive by Lions.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this analogy is not intended to be disrespectful.  I just see little difference between this man&rsquo;s foolishness and anyone who takes Political Correctness seriously enough to allow it to control their behavior to the point of losing all contact with their sense of self-preservation.  I mean, they don&rsquo;t care if they live or die, but they care about offending the easily offended sensibilities of people who DON&rsquo;T care about them!!!!!</p>

			<p>Furthermore, I am deeply disturbed about the lack of details. &#8220;There seems to be a bout of secrecy involving Eva&rsquo;s murder. I guess the AP does not want to get Whites upset if they knew the truth.</p>
<p>Truly disgusting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry, you are onto it.  I went on CNN&rsquo;s website yesterday morning and found the article with a short description of the rape/torture of Eve Carson.  But there were no photos of the perps.  Later in the day, I happened to check back and found photos, but strangely, the mention of the rape/torture was missing.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that our media most likely directed by both Federal and local governments want all possible imflamatory information repressed when it can be.  But I am also double sure that this has been going on for decades.  The race riots at my high-school in CA in 1971 were sparked by racial bullying by blacks over several years but were never mentioned in the local media, let alone nationally - during or after the fact.  It was obvious that the fear of riot out-breaks everywhere caused the news black-out.  (Pun intended)</p>
<p>I agree with those who do think that there is a growing resentment among whites regarding all the anti-white violence, but we are a long, long way from any acting out.  The only way we can act is to arm, carry and be conscious of our surroundings.  No one educated poor Eve Carson about personal seucrity, so a beautiful, bright young woman met a horrible end.  How many times do we have to see this happen?</p>
<p>I send my deepest condolences to her friends and family.</p>

			<p>Has a study ever been done to try and compare the relative amounts of empathy, shame, or introspection posessed by different races? It seems most blacks are lacking in these traits. Our laws were made for people of European descent that share these traits to about the same degree. It may be that there does not exist one set of laws that can be applied universally. Maybe our system of laws are too alien to work for  blacks. Or other races for that matter.</p>

<p>I have noticed that the ideas here at AR and related Sites are getting much more potent.  The above quote is one such idea.</p>
<p>The MSM is a mouthpiece of the Power Elite, and as such, they certainly share in the power.  They also share in the responsibility.  Fact of the matter is, they&rsquo;re a bunch of losers.  I don&rsquo;t care how much money and power they have.  They&rsquo;re intellectually shallow and morally bankrupt.  </p>
<p>But, as far as this next quote is concerned, &#8220;We need some media outlet to keep reporting on this.&#8221;  the obvious answer is; We already have one.  It&rsquo;s called - The Internet.  And don&rsquo;t underestimate is anonymous poster.  Because you just used it in a way that was both effective, and exemplary. </p>

<p>Great post!</p>
<p>I was having a conversation about exactly this just today, a couple of hours ago in fact. Talk about a &#8220;cultural convergence&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s when two or more people unknown to each other have the same idea.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I said to my friend was this - &#8220;Blacks are big on self-pity, but low on empathy.&#8221;  In fact, like all sociopaths, empathy just does not enter into it.</p>
<p>I will never forget what my Psychologist said to me when I told him how upset I was when a group of Blacks intimidated my girlfriend while she waited for me to get out of work.<br/>
She was Japanese and four of them came up to her and said &#8220;hi&#8221; and she ignored them.  They said, &#8220;Why do you Chinese always ignore Black men?&#8221;<br/>
Fearless and unmoved she said &#8220;You&rsquo;re not men, and I&rsquo;m not Chinese.&#8221;<br/>
They said, &#8220;Say &#8220;hi&#8221; or we&rsquo;re not going away.&#8221;<br/>
So she said &#8220;hi&#8221;. They laughed at their little &#8220;victory&#8221; and walked away.<br/>
When she told me I lost it and went looking for them. <br/>
Not finding them I took my anger to my Psychologist.<br/>
He was a sweet old man from Switzerland.  He told me not to get into a fight with them, but to do everything I could to avoid them.  I asked him why and he simply said &#8220;Don&rsquo;t fight with them, because they don&rsquo;t have a conscience and will be better at it then you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget Lauen Burk who died at the hands of another one who was trying to rape her. Lauren was also from northern Georgia as was eve Carson. They were murdered within days of each other. <br/>
The &#8220;mother&#8221; of the predator apologized to the Burk family. I&rsquo;m sure that made it all OK. What she should have apologized for was bringing him into the world in the first place.</p>
<p>Two more innocent young White girls to add to the ever growing list.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;In a way, Eve Carson herself might have been a victim of this PC brainwashing. If she had a realistic view, she might have had a pistol and been safe behind a locked door. Instead, she was easy pickings for the jackels and hyenas.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
Are you insane?  First of all, you&rsquo;re blaming the victim (oh, yes you are   &mdash;   even though you say Eve &#8220;might have been a victim of PC brainwashing&#8221;).  You are saying this INNOCENT PERSON, who was just going about her business, should have done something different.  THAT IS BLAMING THE INNOCENT VICTIM.</p>
<p>Secondly, is cowering behind locked doors, armed with a weapon, your idea of LIVING?</p>
<p>You should be completely outraged at the CRIMINALS and at the SYSTEM that allows INNOCENT PEOPLE to be thrown away like so much trash.</p>
<p>Am I angry?  You bet.  What has happened to this country that innocent people can no longer even EXPECT to live in freedom and security?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve already stated my opinion on the endemic hatred some blacks have for whites and my utter amazement that millions of white voters would actually consider voting for, not just any black man, but a black man that has been sitting in a racist church, and listening to a racist preacher(against whites) for more than twenty years. All I have to say further is that it says much more about the people voting for Obama, than it says about Obama,which is quite clear and simple  &mdash;  to folks with two brain cells.</p>

			<p>Pat Henry, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with your thoughts on criminality and the reactions of many Americans. I worked with a guy from the so-called greatest generation, and when we were discussing the rising crime in Los Angeles County, he had the attitude that, well, he and his wife don&rsquo;t go out of the house much after 6 P.M. A became somewhat perturbed at hearing him say this and asked him exactly the question you put to the poster you were replying to. Should we be cowering behind locked doors, armed and ready for battle? Is this what life in America is supposed to become. I can&rsquo;t walk my dog, at say, midnight, if I feel like it? Yes, Pat Henry, I sometimes wonder where Americans heads are at. Seriously, I do.</p>

			<p>We need to be outraged. And this outrage needs to be manifested in some kind of action.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve stated many times before on this forum, we&rsquo;ve got to make the criminal element more afraid of us than we are of them. They obviously are not afraid of law enforcement. Headlines need to be made. Would be rapists and assaulters, of whatever race, need to end up dead; preferably at the hands of their potential victims.<br/>
We also need to get rid of this false perception of reality that we&rsquo;re feeding the public in the entertainment media vis a vis the role played by Afro-Americans in our TV series and our movies. &#8220;Art&#8221; needs to reflect life as it really is and not the flights of fancy fed to us by the Left. </p>

			<p>I hope that there are still people reading the comments on this particular story. The link below is for messages of condolence to Eve Carson&rsquo;s family. I responded to some of the comments about Eve smiling down on us from heaven and how she will always be remembered for her goodness etc.. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I understand that it&rsquo;s comforting to people who have had to suffer such a terrible atrocity committed against a loved one.<br/>
What I can&rsquo;t understand is the absolute lack of the human emotion of vengeance. If that were my beautiful daughter or son, I would spend the rest of my life figuring out a way to get to those bastards. <br/>
Anyway, I wrote a comment wishing the family some peace and the perpetrators a speedy trip to Hell along with those who spawned them. The post was moderated and not suprisingly, rejected.</p>
