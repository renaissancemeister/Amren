<h1><a href="/news/oregonian/index-ssf_/base/news/1213329308275350.xml">North Portland MAX Attack Renews Fear, Safety Worries</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dylan Rivera, Oregonian, June 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An assault by five teenagers on a North Portland MAX train this week revived worries about mass transit safety since several high-profile incidents last winter. </p>
<p>Teenage boys and girls punched, used racial epithets and stole the purse of a 28-year-old Vancouver woman who was taking her first-ever MAX ride early Monday evening. The woman, who is white, had just had a conversation with the teens, who are African American and were harassing another woman, according to Portland police. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It was completely traumatizing and absolutely horrifying for me,&rdquo; said the Vancouver woman, who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation. &ldquo;It seemed like forever.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The attack renewed calls for more security on the region&rsquo;s light-rail system. And it raised warnings that the close of the school year this week could be the beginning of a summer of criminal activity by some teenagers. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said they have arrested four youths ages 14 to 16 suspected in the Monday assault. A fifth teenager is still at large, and officials released security camera video of the incident in hopes that the public can help identify the thin, 5-foot-6 suspect wearing light-colored clothing and going by the name Adrian. </p>
<p>Police said the teens initially called the Vancouver woman racially derogatory names. Then, as the train approached a station at North Interstate Avenue and North Prescott Street, they started punching her, police said. </p>
<p>The woman said a boy stole her purse and ran from the train after it stopped. A mix of boys and girls repeatedly punched her, and some girls hit her with purses. She said she also was hit with a can of beer. </p>
<p>She said the attack escalated when the group turned on her while harassing another, older woman, who had asked the teens to tone down their act. There was no transit security on the train, she said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not intervene,&rdquo; the Vancouver woman said, adding that she had tried to ignore them. &ldquo;They got in my face. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, I just said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care what color you are, if I want you out of my face, I&rsquo;d tell you to get out of my face.&rsquo; &ldquo; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the teens got physical. She said she tried to fight back but was punched and stepped on. </p>

			<p>I reported this yesterday on another posting.  I spoke with a friend who lives near there who next told me of a similar attack earlier in the week.  I missed that one and so did the media, apparently.  I will find out more and report.</p>

			<p>Funny, I couldn&rsquo;t find anything in the original article about these teenagers being charged with hate crimes, even though they did use racial slurs.  I mean, doesn&rsquo;t lib Portland and lib Oregon have hate crime rider provisions on the books?</p>

			<p>Public transportatiion is a joke in most places in the United States. Also, Oregon is a liberal enclave of a State that is going to deserve everything coming to it, if the people in that State don&rsquo;t start to wise up. On illegal immigration, to cite only one issue, they are gross enablers of it.</p>

			<p>The buses and MAX light rail system are supposed to be gun free zones, or at least free of guns carried by law abiding citizens.</p>
<p>I always want to have a gun ready with which I can defend myself, and I hate being without one. Personally, I virtually never set foot on the buses or trains. Years pass between the times when I feel forced by circumstances to use them. I regard them as little more than roving gang platforms. </p>

			<p>This is only going to get worse. Thanks to the leftist/marxist PC indoctrination of White people who will even try to defend these punk kids. Now this is RACISM! Yet our government still protects them as a protected minority group! Appeasement of these dregs of society will only encourage more violence, as we have seen in the last 30 years or so.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again, because it&rsquo;s worth repeating.<br>
Western Civilization&rsquo;s deterioration began first with Class and then spread to Race.  That&rsquo;s all.  And Race is far - FAR - more combustible than Class ever was.<br>
But Whites should know by now that the seeds of this are in the Judeo-Christian Tradition.  It led to a bit of a strange combination of Judgement and Mercy and eventually led to &#8220;the less shall have more&#8221;.<br>
Well now, that has degenerated into &#8220;the absolute bottom of the f-ing barrel shall run wild in the streets and do whatever they please.&#8221;<br>
Whites only reveal either their ignorance of History or disingenuousness when they say &#8220;oh my, how terrible.&#8221;<br>
Just read Ortega&rsquo;s &#8220;The Revolt of the Masses&#8221;. Do you think he was talking about Black people? Of course not!<br>
But don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I&rsquo;m taking sides in this one. As Mr. Taylor has said, Race is an extended family of sorts.  It&rsquo;s possible to have falling outs and then mend fences, with anyone - If there&rsquo;s a will. There&rsquo;s no such will at the moment among the Races, none.  Their are lots of Human Floor-mats and People-Pleasers, who learned that behavior in their Families first, Society second. And both from their Culture, which properly speaking, subsumes them all. <br>
But as far as we&rsquo;re concerned, the fact of the matter is, that Whites have a lot to talk about. Jewish, Christian, Secular. And we shouldn&rsquo;t close the door on anyone else who is sympathetic and wants what we have. But first things first. Seperate from those who wish us harm and do so without being meely mouthed and apologetic about it. </p>

			<p>The good-folks of the Human Rights Commission in Canada were in the news the other day. They passed an important hate-speech law. You have to give them credit for their forward thinking. You have to make sure you control what whites may say as this kind of thing happens, every hour. </p>

			<p>Incidents worse than this one used to happen on a weekly basis in San Francisco,but they are much rarer now. The only way to protect yourself is to always be aware that young black passengers should not be trusted, and they are always trying their hardest to find an excuse to intimidate, harass, or assault any vulnerable passenger who is white. Have some form of means to defend yourself, pepper spray, a pipe, a knife, etc, and be willing and able to use them effectively.</p>

			<p>Teen gets prison for beating MAX rider<br>
Crime - The victim, 72, still on the mend, says he hopes his attacker also eventually recovers Friday, June 13, 2008AIMEE GREEN The Oregonian Staff <br>
When the teenagers pushed past Laurie Lee Chilcote to get off the MAX train at the Gresham Central station on Nov. 3, he told them they shouldn&rsquo;t be shoving an old man. </p>
<p>Fifteen-year-old Abel Chavez-Garcia responded by taunting the 71-year-old Chilcote and then bludgeoning him over the head with a baseball bat. </p>
<p>On Thursday, Chavez-Garcia was sentenced to 91/2 years in prison after telling Multnomah County Circuit Judge Eric Bergstrom that he felt bad about what happened that night. </p>
<p> Advertisement<br>
  </p>
<p><br>
   <br>
 <br>
&#8220;Nothing I can do about it anymore,&#8221; said Chavez-Garcia, now 16. &#8220;I regret what I did.&#8221; </p>
<p>Chilcote wasn&rsquo;t in court to see his attacker sentenced, but in a telephone interview from his Sandy home he said he was satisfied with the sentence and hoped the youth would come out of prison a better person. </p>
<p>He said his body is still sore from the attack and he feels emotionally drained. In a letter to the court read by prosecutor Donald Rees, Chilcote said: &#8220;I do want this immature, uneducated young person to know I am not intimidated by his criminal behavior. I will recover eventually, but will he?&#8221; </p>
<p>Chavez-Garcia, who jiggled his leg and fidgeted with his fingers through parts of the hearing, pleaded guilty to first-degree assault. He also pleaded guilty to second-degree robbery for an Oct. 13 attack on a 16-year-old boy in Gresham. Authorities say Chavez-Garcia punched the boy, ripped off his red bandanna and set it on fire. </p>
<p>After the sentencing, police released more details of the November assault. </p>
<p>Police said Chavez-Garcia, who is a Southside gang member, was spraying graffiti at a MAX stop before boarding an eastbound train with two friends. At the next stop, the youths pushed ahead of Chilcote. The man chided the teenagers for their rudeness. </p>
<p>Chavez-Garcia, struck Chilcote from behind, knocking him down. He hit him again as he lay in the street. A detective found Chilcote unconscious at a crosswalk near the station.<br>

			<p>I moved to Portland from Washington DC about 4 years ago, mainly because my wife gave birth to our first son, and I wanted to find a better place for him to grow up. Moreover, I grew up the token white in a black, inner-city neighborhood in DC, and knowing black so-called culture firsthand, I didn&rsquo;t want my son to experience what I had experienced. Although I love this city, and my family and I have come to call it home, there are certain things that I&rsquo;ve been able to observe in my time here.</p>
<p>Regarding whites, you have three kinds here in the Pacific Northwest: the vigilant, the destructive, and the oblivious. </p>
<p>- The oblivious are normally your native Oregonians. Since they&rsquo;ve been sheltered from blacks their entire lives, they believe naively that their white-world is a bland one, and try to inject it with &#8216;color.&rsquo; In this respect, they&rsquo;re as racially conscious as your typical toddler</p>
<p>- The destructive usually take the form (in Portland) of New Englanders, Upper Midwesterners (WI, MN, IA, etc, and Californians (specifically San Franciscans). They consciously decided to not live in a diverse area, but nevertheless talk about what a bad thing that Portland is not diverse, etc. Whatever, &#8216;black&rsquo; friends they may have typically take the form of a frizzy-haired mulattos who grew up around whites.</p>
<p>- The vigilant (and we are around) are people who grew up and lived around blacks, decided it was madness, and kept running until we got to a white city. I&rsquo;ve had several conversations with people who came from places like Detroit, DC, Atlanta, NY, and I have yet to meet someone from these parts who didn&rsquo;t share our views or weren&rsquo;t at least very sympathetic.</p>
<p>This stated, as we all know, black people are,by and large, nothing but animals. Yes, there are exceptions, but our mistake has been to look at them individually, rather than as a collective. The blacks of the Pacific NW are probably the most despicable since not only did they grow up around whites their entire lives (as opposed to many of us), but they try to demonstrate their blackness in an almost cartoonish way. If you saw them as opposed to, say, a black in LA or Chicago, they almost seem like a caricature.</p>
<p>In sum, these blacks despise and reject white culture, only to show that you can&rsquo;t make men out of monkeys.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to finally take stand, and I am taking the written and physical exams for the Portland PD. At this point I could care less about the business world. The only thing I want to do is do my part to keep the city a nice place.</p>

			<p>These thugs attacked this poor woman simply because whe was white. But this article does everything to avoid saying so or mentioning the words &#8220;hate crime&#8221;. And these punks were not charged with a hate crime. Surprise, surprise!! In fact here is a quote from the original story which isnt included in the AmRen edited version:</p>
<p>&#8220;The four teens are accused of robbery, assault and intimidation. The intimidation count stems from the alleged racial comments, said Sgt. Brian Schmautz, a police spokesman.&#8221; </p>
<p>Intimidation? INTIMIDATION??? Five blacks attack and beat a white woman while calling her &#8220;racially derogatory names&#8221; and the media and the police cant bring themselves to call this what it was, which was a hate crime? Can someone please tell me just what a black, or any non white, has to do to be charged with a hate crime when their victim is white? The black THUGS in the Channon and Chris murder case were not charged with hate crimes if I remember right. How can we as a people stand by and allow this nonsense to continue? </p>

<p>What prompted this white woman to even broach the subject of &#8220;color&#8221;?  Was she accused of being &#8220;racist&#8221; because she had the temerity to defend herself against the black thugs or was it  used as a disclaimer (&#8220;I don&rsquo;t care what color your are&hellip;&#8221;) that brainwashed Whites  are conditioned to use so they don&rsquo;t appear to be &#8220;racist&#8221; when being pummeled? Apparently the black thugs initiated the name calling, so I&rsquo;m puzzled unless something was missing from the story.</p>

			<p>According to Canada&rsquo;s hate crime law, the media who covered it, and I&rsquo;m sure the school teachers too, it&rsquo;s whites who are holding up race relations. There&rsquo;s now a woman in Canada, along with most of us AmReners, susceptible to believing a different point of view. Good thing she won&rsquo;t be expressing her views. That&rsquo;s the highest duty of people of color and their &#8216;educated&rsquo; supporters. </p>

			<p>These kinds of incidents are a national problem wherever blacks are.  We&rsquo;ve read about numerous black on white/non-black attacks just recently, and a search of the news throughout the country would reveal that blacks are out of control and have been out of control for decades now.  If they aren&rsquo;t harassing or attacking whites, they&rsquo;re dong the same to other races.</p>
<p>But the one big exception is explained in the lead articles to today&rsquo;s stories where blacks are trying the same thing on HIspanics and are getting beaten and killed in response to their criminal assaults.</p>
<p>Until the spineless MSM and gutless government officials start calling black racism for what it is, in order to curtail it by condemining it,  these attacks are going to continue to escalate as they have all along, and the black/Hispanic clashes will grow more numerous and deadly.</p>
<p>But I doubt that we&rsquo;ll see anything different coming from anybody, so it&rsquo;s pretty obvious things will continue to accelerate until it&rsquo;s even further out of control.</p>
<p>America and the West will never know peace so long as the black hordes are not brought under control.</p>
<p>The answer is more prison space and harsher sentences for black violence, until the greaest propportion of blacks are warehoused in the penitentiary. </p>

<p><br>
OK!  Case closed.  It was the white lady&rsquo;s fault.  She should not have said what she said.  Everything would have been fine if she hadn&rsquo;t opened her racist mouth.  Next case, please!  /s</p>
<p>So will they be charged with a hate crime?  Let&rsquo;s hold our collective breath&hellip;</p>

			<p>Yep, not hate crime right? even with racial epithets, right? Get the blacks out of your city, we need to segregate them amongst themselves and shouldn&rsquo;t be let out into decent society. Where were the white men while this white woman was being assulted?</p>

			<p>With all due respect, Fletcher (posting at 5:53 pm), you&rsquo;re wrong in regard to white voters and Obama.  They don&rsquo;t care how many people are victimized by blacks as they bow to their new god.  Nothing will dissuade them from voting for him. </p>
<p>Liberals think in baseless theory, they reject personal responsibility, and they will deny the obvious at every turn. Liberalism is a perverse religion to them, and they are not about to be labeled &#8220;heretic&#8221;. They&rsquo;re socialists, and this is a part of their profile.   </p>
<p>No, Fletcher, this incident nor another thousand white victims won&rsquo;t make a dent in Obama&rsquo;s popularity with white liberals. He&rsquo;s their new messiah.  </p>

			<p>According the racial breakdown between the two races, Whites comprise 75.5% of Portland&rsquo;s population of 537,000 while Blacks represent only 6.6% so their proportional numbers should suggest a rather low profile in incidents of this type - but they don&rsquo;t. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Portland-Oregon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.city-data.com/city/Portland-Oregon.html</a></p>
<p>With more research into Portland&rsquo;s crime statistics we would likely find almost 50% of the violent crime committed by 3.3% Black males and an even lesser percentile so for Black males between 14 and 44 yrs. old.</p>

			<p>This is the land of the great Northwest (Homeland) Republic? Yeah - right! It seems no different than black dominated Baltimore, MD, where blacks &#8220;own&#8221; public transport.  A year ago, my husband and I were on the Baltimore light rail (what a joke!), going to a baseball game at Camden Yards when a black woman boarded the car in which we were riding, looked at us and said to all the other passengers (who were all black) &#8220;We should kill all da White people.&#8221; Fortunately, no one responded to her call, and so I say we were damn lucky or blessed. When I bring this incident up among my White educator colleagues who are so &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; there is nothing but silence because God knows, blacks cannot be racists.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;This attack is something white women must get used to; and now it seems white women are also under attack in the workplace as is the focus of this blog&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a white female thing, white males are under attack. However, if you notice, it&rsquo;s more women or elderly white males. Why? Because these two groups are weaker physically and these feral blacks often attack in packs, people who are less likely to be able to fight back. Had this commuter been a buff 6&rsquo;4&#8221; young white body builder, I&rsquo;ll bet they would have backed down. That is why whites, but especially women and the elderly, need to arm themselves.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not well educated on this subject but I&rsquo;d have to disagree with that. Could it be that the white lower classes were debased in the first place in order that they would accept the habits of their darker hued friends? Of course one could argue now, that race is used to divide, keeping the white working class from selfishly voting for their own far-left economic interests. Perhaps the elites are controlling my very thoughts as I write this, oh man&hellip; </p>

			<p>By the way. When I mentioned the Judeo-Christian tradition in relation to this - Judgement and Mercy - The less shall have more - I don&rsquo;t think I succeeded in making it as clear as I could have. So, I&rsquo;d like to correct that if I may. <br>
Both Judgement and Mercy are used by the Power Elite today as exclusive terms. Judgement for Whites, Mercy for Non-Whites.<br>
The dumbed down, degenerate, PC version of this is &#8220;Anarcho-Tyranny&#8221; to use Samuel Francis&rsquo;s superb phrase.<br>
It&rsquo;s an especially good phrase to use when it is linked to our Cultural roots, simply because it shows how far we&rsquo;ve gone astray, and how far we&rsquo;ve fallen as a result. <br>
What is Judgement without limits, or content, except Tyranny. And<br>
what is Mercy without discipline except Anarchy.  </p>

			<p>Frankly, I am amazed that the Portland papers are so innocent that they still print racial details regarding the perps and the victims.   I cannot imagine such candor in our big city Eastern newspapers which have grown very cunning in hiding all racial details  (unless the crime is by a white against a black).  </p>
<p>This apparently means that Portland still has so few such black on white  crimes that the reporters there have not yet learned the proper way of squelching the forbidden news.  In an odd way, that&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>

			<p>Black teens seem to be more violent towads whites than they were a decade or two ago. Just tonight in a parking lot an angry group of black teens were pushing shopping carts at cars. As I was walking to my car one of them said &#8220;look at white boy&#8221; (despite the fact that I am a middle aged gentleman)..then they pushed a cart at my car and it almost hit it. I just drove away. I had no doubt if I would have stepped out to lecture them they would have beaten me to a bloody pulp. </p>

			<p>Having lived in the Atlanta area for many years, I have witnessed the horrendous traffic problems that have resulted from the failure of most commuters to utilize the mass transit system.  The media and government has blamed wasteful thoughtless suburban commuters for this problem and pretend to be mystified as to why they don&rsquo;t use a perfectly good system.  We should send MARTA girl an additional government payment of some kind to reward her for illustrating the point: </p>

Never show your fear.  These underclass-lings have no other power in their lives, so when a white person shows them fear, its power to them.  Be vigilant but not fearful.</p>

			<p>These black youths should be interogated as to their thoughts and feelings of whites.  White liberals should not be allowed to assume the same old fairy tales that blacks are just innocent simple people devoid of hatred.  The largest most overt group of &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; are the white liberals since they never ask the opinions of their faithful colored companions yet assume that they agree with the white libs on everything.</p>

			<p>I used to be an enthusiastic supporter of public transportation but now I oppose spending another for bus, trolley, and subway systems.  They have become too dangerous for white people to use.  Last year we had case in southern New Jersey in which a young white woman got off a PATCO train and was kidnapped by two black men from Camden as she tried to get to her car in the station parking lot.  She was raped and killed.  Last month in Philadelphia a gang og seven black teenagers attacked a white man from behind on a SEPTA subway platform.  They knocked him down and then killed him by kicking him in the head, neck, and chest.  The tv and radio news keeps reporting that he died from an asthma attack although his mother claims that he never suffered from asthma.  I guess that story makes the killing a little less violent.  Public transportation is only useful in civilized areas.</p>

			<p>In spite of decades of incidents like these, blacks still claim to be astonished that whites don&rsquo;t want to be around them.  To the extent that they think about it at all, they regard us as being &#8220;racist&#8221; for not wanting to be beaten up, robbed, raped or killed.</p>

Portland has all sorts of cliques from gangs in the Los Angeles area today, for example. And they hang out around the stations. Too bad this woman didn&rsquo;t get the news.</p>

<p>Not if you were armed. I blame a lot of this on the news media which constantly pumps blacks full of anti-white blather ie. whitey be keeping you down. As such, this increases anger and hostility in blacks and more attacks like these happen. Imagine if the news media preached that redheads were the cause of everyone&rsquo;s problems, you&rsquo;d see far more attacks on them.<br>

			<p>I agree with all the above comments with one caveat.  The White race traitors are refered to as &#8220;Liberals.&#8221;  I just think that is too soft a term.  To me they are Marxists.  Marxists want to destroy normal society and replace it with their own obscene, anti-normal, twisted utopian vision.  They want to mix races, destroy families, destroy all non-governmental institutions, destroy religion, and silence opposition.  This is straight out of the Communist Manifesto.  Communism, the economic system, may be dead in our society.  But Marxism, the social system, reigns supreme in academia, bureacracy, private institutions, the  media&hellip;wherever opinions are formed and forced upon the public.  We are becoming victims of the same philosophy that was responsible for the deaths of 100 million people in the 20th century.  Call them Marxists and put THEM on the defensive.</p>

			<p>I sorta rejoice, in a sadly perverse way, at reading accounts like this, because more sheltered whites need to experience the joys and benefits of diversity.  Only that will eventually wake them up.</p>
<p>Otherwise, when they preface their lamentations with the standard disclaimer:  &#8220;I am not a racist, but&hellip;.&#8221;  or, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care care what color they were, but&hellip;&#8221; then I have little sympathy.

			<p>These types of crimes are becoming an everday occurrence.  They involve mobs of blacks attacking innocent whites, and the motivation is racial hatred, pure and simple.  These crimes are callous and cowardly in so many ways: they are unprovoked crimes of hatred, committed in packs against a single innocent victim.  Of course, the hate crimes laws will not be applied, because in the eyes of our lawmakers, blacks are simply &#8220;incapable&#8221; of manifesting violent hatred toward anyone (hah!)</p>
<p>Imagine just one incident with the races reversed.  It would be headline news on the MSM for days, likely weeks.  We just have to remember the Jena debacle to see how the media treats perceived racial hatred from whites to blacks (and that was just the supposed hanging of a noose, which obvioulsy didn&rsquo;t involve any physical harm)   &mdash;   imagine how the MSM would treat an ACTUAL act of violence of whites against blacks.  Yet, the converse situation   &mdash;   racial attacks committed by black mobs against white inncoents   &mdash;   is now a perennial event, and yet these events are buried in the back pages of local newspapers (if reported at all).</p>

I am someone who must use public transit. Therefore, I would rejoice if and when gasoline rises to $20. a gallon.  Yes!!!   I hope it goes to a hundred!  Only when gas becomes prohibitive and whites in large numbers are <i>FORCED  </i>to use the public transit systems that their dollars have built, will they be able to take them back.  Until then, it remains dangerous for the one in ten or twenty elderly or disabled whites that you see there.  And, given the  collapsing dollar and the crumbling US economy, we are going to come to that. It&rsquo;s inevitable.  For me, it can&rsquo;t be too soon.   </p>
<p>Whites need a good shock to wake them up.   As long as they can flee reality in their automobiles and escape to their safe suburbs, moving farther and farther out,  nothing is ever going to change. Someday they&rsquo;ll be commuting a hundred miles to work (some already are).  Blacks will keep encroaching, and whites will keep fleeing. Whites will stop looking the other way, and will finally react only when they HAVE to.  Especially when black crime touches THEM.</p>
<p>Incidentally, though I don&rsquo;t live too far away, I never knew anything about those above crimes. They&rsquo;re news to me!  That tells us something about our &#8220;news&#8221; services, doesn&rsquo;t it?  Keep the public pacified and ignorant. Keep them doped on sports, celebrities and sex scandals. Tell them all about what&rsquo;s what in Hollywood, but don&rsquo;t let them know what&rsquo;s going on in their own back yards.  Thank God for the Internet, or I&rsquo;d still be unaware.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been said that blacks are incapable of peacefully co-existing with a technology that they would not have been able to develop on their own - and it seems that applies to public transportation just as it applies to guns.</p>

<p>Blacks do this only because THEY KNOW THEY CAN. And each incident proves they&rsquo;re right.  Whites are disunified and have no sense of racial solidarity. They&rsquo;ve been stripped of it by years of propaganda. </p>
<p>While racial solidarity has been   &mdash;   for many decades now   &mdash;   extolled as a good thing for blacks, it&rsquo;s been made shameful for whites.  Hence, other whites will look the other way while you&rsquo;re being attacked, because they don&rsquo;t want to be thought &#8220;racist&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8220;Racist&#8221; has come to replace what &#8220;communist&#8221; was in the l950s   &mdash;    the most awful thing anyone could be.</p>

			<p>I live in Portland. This is just one of many MAX attacks, and they are a big story up here. Obviously, 100% of the attackers are minorities, and most of the victims are whites.<br>
There have been a huge number of attacks on liberal, naive, &#8216;hipster&rsquo; whites who have moved into Portland&rsquo;s black neighborhoods to gentrify them. I remember watching the news awhile back when a victim was interviewed. He said he pleaded with the &#8216;youths&rsquo; to stop beating him because he &#8216;lived in their neighborhood.&rsquo; <br>
I think he deserved it :)<br>

The only difference is that here we do not have Africans (In any sufficient numbers)to make things as miserable as possible.</p>

<p>I read that article, too, and the NYP keeps calling an 18-year old man a &#8220;kid.&#8221;  He might barely be a legal adult in the eyes of the state, but in the realm of his criminal career, he is middle-aged.  If black thuggery were the Army, he would be a Major by now.</p>

<p>I normally never post, but I felt obligated to from personal experience&hellip;<br>
Being from Portland, I personally know two people (a suburban white son and mother) who were hospitalized for a week after being attacked by a mob of black teenagers while riding the MAX. The girls in the group were talking loudly and graphically about sex and the characteristics and differences of eachothers genitals. (It&rsquo;s graphic, but it must be told). They were talking so loud that all the passengers could hear. My friend politely asked them to quiet down, and they proceeded to beat them unconcious.<br>
There was another story recently about some visiting Boise teenagers who were savagely beaten and had all their belongings stolen while riding the MAX.<br>
This happens all the time in Portland. For whatever reason, they decided to publish this one.</p>

I&rsquo;m not entirely sure about that.  Whether they hate or not, I think they go for whites simply because they know that whites are the easiest victims. Most modern whites have been so pacified and gelded that they will not fight back, and blacks know that. Blacks have come to expect that most whites will bite their tongues and quiver in fear. </p>
<p>Blacks have also been given to understand, by a lifetime of education and entertainment, that whitey is responsible for all their problems, and therefore their &#8220;rage&#8221; is justified. There is no one in public life who is standing up and saying otherwise. Hence, blacks see it as simply collecting a long overdue debt that is owed them. They are finally getting even.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not apologizing for them; I&rsquo;m just trying to get into their head and see it they way they do.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Gangs have used the rail system on the Pacific Coast to expand all the way up to Seattle Washington and beyond. Portland has all sorts of cliques from gangs in the Los Angeles area today, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s discussed, this sort of thing has been given all sorts of labels in an effort to brush it off. First, it was just &#8216;a random act of violence&rsquo;, like an act of nature. Then it was summed up as simply &#8216;gang related&rsquo;. Then it was always attributed to the influence of young people from outside of town &#8216;from Detroit&rsquo; (I&rsquo;m from the midwest - it was hundreds of miles away from detroit though, and in a backward area as well). Anyway, that just sounded a bit familiar. </p>

The beginning of the end did occur, but the date was 1789 and the event was the French Revolution.  Kant merely correctly pointed out the limits to the employment of pure reason; he was not a member of the French Enlightenment.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Only when gas becomes prohibitive and whites in large numbers are FORCED to use the public transit systems that their dollars have built, will they be able to take them back. Until then, it remains dangerous for the one in ten or twenty elderly or disabled whites that you see there. And, given the collapsing dollar and the crumbling US economy, we are going to come to that. It&rsquo;s inevitable.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;It began in 1776 with the publication of The Critique of Pure Reason, ending with Deconstructionism. Along the way Bentham called natural rights &ldquo;nonsense on stilts&rdquo;. Reason/Rights/Civilization are masculine, and led to the female reaction, which we are now enjoying&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not true. Marxism is responsible for this, a male creation and it is this that is causing the problems. People do have natural rights however they also have natural responsibilities and must exercise common sense. We don&rsquo;t have too much common sense.</p>

			<p>Here in Portland, there have also been several attacks by packs of blacks against whites (mostly females), who were riding bicycles.  Attacks here have been escalating over the past few years.  I agree with the poster who said that the behavior of blacks has changed since Obama - much more beligerant.  Blacks have watched Jeremiah Wright get a free pass, and will now push the envelope even further.</p>

			<p>I am a white female.  I used the DC public transportation system from the ages of 14-21, when I got my first car.  I never had any really bad experiences, but I learned the first rule was to KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT when this was going on (black teenagers screaming and hollering, often obscenities, at each other).  As in many big cities, public transit was a substitute for school buses, so if you were on the bus/Metro around 3 pm you would see a lot of this.</p>
<p>I usually had a book with me, which probably made me look like a space alien and was helpful in tuning out the noise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to blame the folks who are attacked, of course, but it worked for me.  Of course, it didn&rsquo;t stop the constant and mostly sexual come-ons from black males, but a look of icy disdain followed by bored silence usually took care of that.  Inside my heart was often pounding with fear, but they eventually got bored or distracted and left me alone.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for people who don&rsquo;t lose their naivete about some groups&rsquo; behavior at an early age like I did.  Maybe this is one of the advantages of diversity&hellip;</p>

			<p>Opposing a road-widening project really depends on the area.  The city of Colorado Springs is going to widen the main road near us - Woodmen Blvd. to three lanes each way, and put in bike paths and sidewalks, but it is a very white area, and my own neighborhood has only one way in or out.  With no through-traffic, there is no &#8220;opportunity crime.&#8221;  Additionally, the area is surrounded by high fences and walls, and my homeowners&rsquo; association owns the streets and sidewalks in the neighborhood; the city does not (street signs here are color-coded: green for city-owned and brown for private).  We&rsquo;re quite assertive about confronting strangers we see in the area, asking them why they are here and when unsatisfactory answers are given, informing them they are trespassing, and telling them to leave.</p>
<p>HOA dues are $145 a month, but this covers not merely grounds and road maintenance, but the tennis court and swimming pool.  I did lead the successful fight to avoid putting up a basketball court some years back, as it would have been an &#8220;attractive nuisance&#8221;.  I think we&rsquo;re getting a good deal for the money.</p>
<p>We did get a good scare in 1998 when Classic Homes wanted to put in &#8220;affordable apartments&#8221; on some vacant lots they owned to the south and east of us.  They also wanted to route traffic through our neighborhood, which would have required their a bridge across Cottonwood Creek (no they were *not* trying to &#8220;save money&#8221;, though they claimed the erosion control work they needed to do near Cottonwood Creek would be so expensive that they had to build dense housing just to break even.  Since we knew this was at a time when the apartment market had overbuilt in town and rents were actually falling, we didn&rsquo;t buy it.  Our answer was &#8220;too bad&#8221;.  They ended up putting in a church and some large single-family homes, and ran the sole access road in off Union.  It turns out they didn&rsquo;t need two roads if they were putting in single-family homes.  They did a very nice job; the less dense buildout allowed them to leave almost all of the original trees in place.  The cost of all this was my whole neighborhood going to every meeting, taking notes (some of us used tape-recorders), asking questions, and not letting them obfusticate.</p>
<p>The other vacant lot is zoned for &#8220;mixed use&#8221; and has been for sale for over five years.  I guess Classic Homes doesn&rsquo;t like dealing with us and just wants to get rid of the problem.  It&rsquo;s on a busy corner, so we will probably see a strip mall built there eventually, but since we don&rsquo;t really need another nail salon, fast-food place, car parts store or liquor store in the area, I imagine it will be a while.  We&rsquo;re only a mile from Academy Blvd, which is 17 miles of continuous strip mall, so not even the empty suits working for Classic Homes would try saying there is a shortage of business space here.  What we think is that Classic Homes, since it was building several large subdivisions out east of town at the time, decided to wreck some neighborhoods, in order that the white people in them would want to leave, and buy just-built homes elsewhere from Classic.</p>
<p>City traffic projects are only incidental to the degredation of middle-class neighborhoods.  The main driving force is the property developers, because unlike city governments, property developers actually make a profit on it.  Classic built my neighborhood, so why would they do this?  Simple - they aren&rsquo;t earning any money *right now* on a neighborhood they built 20 years ago.  White people like a quiet neighborhood with mature trees instead of one with construction equipment running every day and little stick trees that won&rsquo;t provide any useful shade for 10-20 years, so the only way to convince them move and become new home buyers in the same general area is to wreck their existing neighborhoods.</p>
<p>For the Aussie who likes Sydney&rsquo;s public transportation system, I have to admit, I liked it very much, too.  The buses were clean, the drivers were helpful when I needed directions, and I never felt remotely unsafe.  It worked so well for me that I never even thought about getting a car, which would also have involved learning to drive on the left, and as a Yank, I have all the wrong instincts in that respect.  I walked to work, and would stop by Cole&rsquo;s on the way home for the groceries that would fit in a backpack.  I took the bus down to the CBD; usually with my three closest friends to eat dinner and catch a movie.  Public transportation, as &#8220;Hideously Censored&#8221; (don&rsquo;t take it personally) hinted, is dependant on the nature of the people who use it.  I used plenty of public transportation in Japan, and it was just fine, though unfortunately when I went from Tokyo to Kyoto, I was seated on the left side of the shinkasen (bullet train), and so didn&rsquo;t get a view of Mt. Fuji.  That was my only complaint.  The electric city trains around Tokyo were no problem, the subway was no problem, and the monorail from Kyoto to the airport at Osaka was no problem.  Even signs were in both Romaji (Japanese written in the Roman alphabet) and Kanji, so while totally illiterate in Kanji, I could sound out a name in Romaji and know whether I was in the right place.</p>
<p>In areas with high population density good public transportation is important.  In the Rurh area of Germany, for instance, can anyone imagine what an absolute mess traffic would be if everyone was on the *roads* at rush hour twice a day?  Nobody would get anywhere!  Japan&rsquo;s cities, even more densely populated, would be totally hopeless.  Unfortunately, American urban areas with enough population density to really need good public transportation have the wrong people living in them for said public transportation to be remotely appealing.</p>
<p>My mother has a free RTD bus pass from work, which is also good for Denver&rsquo;s light rail, and gets occasional free tickets in addition, so when we all go to the museums - the last time was the RMS Titanic exhibit - we use RTD.  Also, the only blacks we see in the museums are the staff and guards, so not many are heading there in the early afternoons.  The blacks who use it are not very numerous, and being mostly older women and men, are well-behaved.  There are also signs present inside, warning that disrupting the operation of public transportation is now a federal felony, with the fines and terms of imprisonment clearly spelled out on the signs.  That said, the drivers are really nice.  One poor women I can politely describe only as a &#8220;meth hag&#8221; (old before her time, very skinny, and no teeth) didn&rsquo;t have quite enough money, but the driver let her on for the trip from Denver to Superior anyway.  She wasn&rsquo;t acting weird, and if she hadn&rsquo;t gotten home that evening, she would have been in downtown Denver all night, where someone could have hurt her.</p>
<p>A good way to get between Colorado Springs and Denver is still the FREX (Front Range EXpress), with park &amp; ride stops at I-25&rsquo;s overpasses near major cross-streets.  It&rsquo;s just white commuters in those.  A bicycle ride of less than ten minutes, downhill the whole way puts me at the nearest FREX stop.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t knock public transportation without thinking closely about the area you live in, and if its future doesn&rsquo;t look good, think carefully about why.  It usually isn&rsquo;t some city council trying to alleviate traffic congestion on the busier roads.</p>

			<p>I used to live in Beaverton, not fair from the red and blue MAX lines (but nowhere near the yellow line, thank goodness).  I can confirm that Portland is chock full of white liberals, many in their 20&rsquo;s and  early 30&rsquo;s, that vehemently take &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; stances in public, yet choose to live far away from the &#8220;people of color&#8221; they profess to desire.  They don&rsquo;t seem to understand WHY Portland is more livable than a Detroit or a New Orleans.</p>
<p>Too bad.  Portland is a very beautiful city, and relatively safe for its size.  The fact that it&rsquo;s over three-fourths white is surely no coincidence.  It&rsquo;s a pity that so many of them are shallow, narcissistic twenty-something liberals.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The destructive usually take the form (in Portland) of New Englanders, Upper Midwesterners (WI, MN, IA, etc, and Californians (specifically San Franciscans). They consciously decided to not live in a diverse area, but nevertheless talk about what a bad thing that Portland is not diverse, etc. Whatever, &lsquo;black&rsquo; friends they may have typically take the form of a frizzy-haired mulattos who grew up around whites.&#8221;</p>

I think you&rsquo;re generally right, but I think the Upper Midwest is marginally different than the West Coast, particularly Northern Minnesota, Northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  </p>
<p>Why?  I think it&rsquo;s due to culture.  The &#8220;Northwoods&#8221; of Northern Minnesota, Northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula contains a lot of people who have a well-defined outdoorsy lifestyle.  Fishing, deer hunting, and snowmobiling are the major cultural pursuits there.  As a general rule, they are very protective of their lifestyle, and can be rather hostile to outsiders (even WHITE outsiders, especially if they are snooty yuppies from the Twin Cities, Chicago, or Madison).  I think that this area is a MUCH better bet for a potential white &#8220;homeland&#8221; than the Pacific Northwest.</p>

			<p>Remember Mayor Katz (Portland) who so bemoaned the &#8220;gentrification&#8221;, that is gentile-ization of her preference, multicult Portland.  A black city council member who spoke out about gangs was chastized by Katz, who she didn&rsquo;t march in Civil Rights demonstrations for him to say stuff like that.I visited Portland briefly 8 years ago.  Took the light rail downtown, 8:30 am, dressed for work.  Suddenly, about 20 young male &#8220;Latinos&#8221; got on the car I was in.  There was only one other white, a male, seated there in a suit. I took stock, and figured my high heels were my best weapon if attacked.  I watched the White male shrink in his chair. We both sensed a threat.  Fortunately, nothing happened.</p>

<p>To be assaulted like that I guess you would have to be attacked by a group. Maybe that&rsquo;s why 8,000 white women in America were gang raped (multiple black assailants) last year. The number of black women gang raped by white men? 1</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s particularly easy pickings in Portland.  I visit there almost every weekend, and it&rsquo;s an incredibly liberal city.  Obama has his biggest rally there.  The population is brainwashed and views blacks as precious guests who must be protected and encouraged.  It&rsquo;s fairly common knowledge, however, to avoid Killingsworth area (I love that name), the Max, and the Lloyd Center.  Gresham, which was previously a solid working class area east of downtown, is the latest victim, and has increasingly become gang territory.  <br>
Blacks didn&rsquo;t build any of those areas.  The only thing they can do is invade and take over, like deadly garden weeds.  Blacks don&rsquo;t build, they only destroy.  <br>

			<p>I have a strong sense that part of the problem is the fact that young black men, for the most part, are a large inmate population in most prisons in this country, (a sub culture,) and are in control of these prisons. As a result of this &#8220;inmate control&#8221;, they do not fear imprisonment-that is a consequent of there criminal behavior out here in society.  </p>

Interesting comments. All of them.  Thanks.  But whatever faults can be found with the French Enlightenment, the  <i>&#8220;ancien régime&#8221;  </i>wasn&rsquo;t composed of saints or philosophers either.  It was rotten to the core.  Even Jefferson was disgusted by it, &#8216;though he was more revolted by the extreme reaction that followed it.  Perhaps significantly, this brief, bloody orgy of <i>Liberté </i>   &mdash;   combined with Brotherhood and Equality   &mdash;   ended in dictatorship and wars of conquest (Napoleon).</p>

<p>They would rather integrate, eliminate the racism, of a working class white neighborhood than they would move into Beverly Hills. That&rsquo;s why there are none left.

			<p>Regarding whites, you have three kinds here in the Pacific Northwest: the vigilant, the destructive, and the oblivious. </p>
<p>- The oblivious are normally your native Oregonians. Since they&rsquo;ve been sheltered from blacks their entire lives, they believe naively that their white-world is a bland one, and try to inject it with &lsquo;color.&rsquo; In this respect, they&rsquo;re as racially conscious as your typical toddler</p>
<p>I live in the Pacific Northwest and we aren&rsquo;t terribly worried about blacks here because there aren&rsquo;t too many of them. However we ARE worried about the Hispanics because we are overrun with them. Many parts of the Northwest are up to 50% or more Huspanic  &mdash;  not that the official statistics will tell you so. Wewant the borders closed and some mass-deportation or something to give us relief, THEN we&rsquo;ll worry about the blacks.</p>

			<p>  <i>&#8220;part of the problem is the fact that young black men, are a large inmate population in most prisons in this country (a sub culture), and are in control of these prisons. As a result of this &ldquo;inmate control&rdquo;,  <b>they do not fear imprisonment </b>  &mdash;   that is a consequence of their criminal behavior .&#8221;   &mdash;    Posted by Rudy  </i><br>

You are so right!</p>
<p>I once had occasion to overhear the conversation of  such a group of young men, just chatting and reminiscing among themselves.  It was all about Cousin Manny just went off to prison, and Leroy just came out,  and Uncle So &amp; So, etc., etc.   This was discussed all in the most matter-of-fact tones. They even joked about the good times they had and the people they met there and the things they learned.  It was fascinating  to hear.  It was a glimpse into THEIR world, a world with completely distorted values.  A world the opposite of our own, where everything we condemn and despise is exaulted and admired.   They have no use for &#8220;white values&#8221;, but only contempt.</p>
<p>I realized that for them, going to jail the first time was a rite of passage; in their sub-culture (as you say) it is something considered perfectly normal.  The introduction to manhood.  Everyone does it.  It&rsquo;s expected. There is no disgrace attached to it.  They go to prison like a  kid from the upper middle class goes off to college.  It&rsquo;s just part of life.</p>

			<blockquote>Perhaps there should be a system in place where anybody with a (violent)criminal record would be required to sit in the back of the bus/train. That way all the trouble makers would be in one place - with armed guards making sure they don&rsquo;t spill over into the civilized sections.

			<p>&#8220;Took the light rail downtown, 8:30 am, dressed for work. Suddenly, about 20 young male &ldquo;Latinos&rdquo; got on the car I was in. There was only one other white, a male, seated there in a suit. I took stock, and figured my high heels were my best weapon if attacked. I watched the White male shrink in his chair. We both sensed a threat. Fortunately, nothing happened.&#8221;</p>

I used to take the MAX frequently when I lived in Beaverton.  I never felt as threatened by groups of Hispanics as I did by groups of blacks.  I usually found riding the MAX to be a safe experience, at least during the day.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  There were, and are, probably a few MS-13 types who have used the MAX as a means to commit a few crimes, but I found the blacks to be far more unnerving in their behavior than the Hispanics.</p>

			<p>Blacks are not the only dangerous thugs in the military.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;It is all too common to find the U.S. Army and Marines willing to bend recruitment rules to fill quotas.&#8221;<br>
Stanley Wynett, Boulder, CO</p>
<p>Captain Esposito, as straightforward as his M4 carbine, was an Eagle Scout and West Point graduate who built a civilian career as a computer specialist for a Wall Street investment bank. His service as a National Guard company commander, family members said, was a matter of honor and old-fashioned patriotism. </p>
<p>Sergeant Martinez came from a tougher background, documents and interviews show, and found camaraderie and discipline in military service. Transplanted from Puerto Rico as a teenager, he drifted through a series of part-time jobs after high school, taking community college classes in electronics. But he had a habit of playing by his own rules, some of his managers said, and lacked maturity. Rejected by the Army Reserve and Navy Reserve, he was fired by U.P.S. in 1999.</p>
<p>The National Guard eventually admitted him on a waiver after three failed attempts to pass the military&rsquo;s standardized aptitude test. Working at the Watervliet Arsenal, near Albany, Sergeant Martinez strained to handle duties that called for more than basic clerical or mechanical work. </p>
<p>In January 2005, with the Iraq insurgency in violent bloom, the dutiful company commander and the struggling sergeant deployed with the 42nd Infantry Division to Kuwait and then to northern Iraq. At a forward operating base in Tikrit, under battlefield conditions in a hostile Sunni Arab region, a mutual distrust between Sergeant Martinez and Captain Esposito devolved into acrimony and, according to Army prosecutors, premeditated murder. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I want him to die,&rdquo; one soldier later testified he heard Sergeant Martinez say soon after their arrival in Iraq.</p>
<p>On June 7 of that year, Sergeant Martinez detonated a Claymore mine he had placed in the window of Captain Esposito&rsquo;s quarters, Army prosecutors said, killing him and severely wounding a first lieutenant, Lou Allen, who died later in surgery. They said three hand grenades were also used in the attack.</p>
<p>In the coming months, Sergeant Martinez is expected to face court-martial in the deaths. He has consistently maintained his innocence. If convicted, he would be eligible for the death penalty. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Spending 6 months in Seattle certainly disabused me of all the fanciful notions I had held about America since childhood. I used to consider myself pretty liberal, but seeing the state of things in America woke me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunatly, Australia is following in America&rsquo;s footsteps for the same reason America became what is. Originally, America had few minorities so no problems and since americans didn&rsquo;t understand through lack of experience with them, were liberal about them. Hence the current problems. You as an individualf were pretty liberal because you&rsquo;d never actually had to live around blacks and others either. People with no experience usually are liberal about is until reality slaps them in the face once they experience it, hence you lost your fanciful notions of the USA. The problem is Australia doesn&rsquo;t have anywhere close to the experience the USA has with this and as such is letting more and more asians,blacks and 3rd world people in. Just like the USA, they too will wake up only when it is too late. Hopefully this won&rsquo;t happen but with the current politically correct climate everywhere in the West, it likely will.<br>

<p>Nothing does more to open your eyes to African behaviour than seeing it for yourself. That is why Iowa, Vermont, etc. voted for him. They think he is white just like them but with a purple tan.</p>

Well, good luck to you!  Really.  You&rsquo;re going to need it, surrounded as you will be by New Asia to the north (formerly known as British Columbia).</p>
<p>Perhaps it will split into New China and New India and will be preoccupied with their own bickering.  Let&rsquo;s hope you don&rsquo;t get drawn into it, as you&rsquo;ll have enough problems of your own, what with the hostile government in  MLK City (formerly Washington), or Chicago or Atlanta or New Orleans, whatever.</p>

			<p>Victor Gerhard, has it as I see it, Communism/Marxism is the ultra liberals true Identity,  Though I&rsquo;ve never read the Manifesto.. I think the modern rendition of slothful envious dirt bags are bent on debasing society&rsquo;s natural order through every evil subtle craft. Appealing to the young and idealistic using words like love and equality ..they cunningly, in true hyena fasion steal away with what others more dignified have created. Especially in the sphere of what I have coined &#8220;Genetic Communism&#8221; the redistribution of genetic wealth by encouraging mischegination via teaching endless propoganda of white guilt  or the rewarding of mindless race traitors as something to be emulated.  My answer to this lefty craft is not to be lions in force but rather lions in force of reason, that is.. through maintained vigilence in bold living as well as verbal open articulation of our self respect and desire to justly perpetuate a healthy white existence. </p>

			<p>I have noticed what cowards they often are. They attack in packs usually on one lone victim, often female. It also seems when they do go one to one, with someone the victim is smaller, weaker and older, and very often they catch them off-guard. Given their reputations for pack attacks on single individuals, it is no longer safe for white women, or the elderly to use public transportation, in communities where blacks make up a significant part of the demographics.</p>

			<p>Nobody said that creating the NAR would be easy.</p>
<p>Where, where, oh where in the name of God did we get this idea that saving our race would be easy? That an all-encompassing revolution of state and society of the kind which is our only hope of racial survival would be without risk and difficulty? </p>
<p>How could we possibly come up with such an absurd notion? No other revolutionary movement in the history of the world, from the I.R.A. to the Bungi-Bungi Liberation Front, has ever started from the premise that they would win their cause without death and prison and long years of agonizing suffering as power is wrenched form one set of hands into another. What has made us such idiots? What has given us this idea that some weird deus ex machina is going to save us without our undergoing any risk or inconvenience at all? Where, exactly, is this mysterious effortless racial salvation going to come from? ETs in flying saucers who will come down from the stars and take us all away to Neptune? </p>
<p>We either choose to fight and die on our feet beneath the blue skies of the Northwest, like men, or we crawl and die in our own excrement-filled diapers in a nursing home being &ldquo;cared for&rdquo; by Nigerians and Filipinos. That&rsquo;s our choice, people. Nothing else on the menu. Take your pick. </p>

I wish you all the best. Truly I do.  But we all    &mdash;   even someone tap-tap-tapping away on a keyboard   &mdash;    are doing SOMETHING, even if  not all in equal amounts. You cannot deal with a problem until you first recognize and acknowledge it.  So give those typists credit.  They are taking the first steps.  Tapping on that keyboard is certainly more than 99.9% of the rest of the white population is doing. </p>

That is what all beasts of prey will do.  Lions or wolves or jackals will always go for the Isolated or sick individual,  the feeble or the young.   </p>
<p>Why would they  look for extra work? They&rsquo;re not out there to prove how brave they are.   Chivalry has nothing to do with it.   They only want an easy kill.   </p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, in Portland blacks do not even make up &#8220;a significant part of the demographics&#8221;.  Only about 6.6 percent.  But that&rsquo;s no impediment, since they know they can get away with it.</p>

<p>You are, or course, right. They ARE doing something, but then it needs to be followed up with action in the <i>real world</i>. Internet postings can lull one into a false sense of action. To all of you who post on this subject here, I ask you to take the next step. Visit the Pacific Northwest, but don&rsquo;t go to the big cities. Get out into the surrounding country, away from the crime, pollution, and other problems that come with living in a big city. </p>
<p>Some may not be able to make the leap right away, so, as they say in a popular motel ad, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll keep the lights on for you.&#8221;</p>
