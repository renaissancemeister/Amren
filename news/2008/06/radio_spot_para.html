			<p>I was raised in an all-white neighborhood.  We had no street crime.  Our schools were top rated and free of graffiti and vandalism.  Our streets were not made unsafe by marauding bands of &#8220;youths.&#8221;  </p>
<p>When we wanted something different from what our little community had to offer   &mdash;   which was not very often   &mdash;   we went to non-all-white neighborhoods, at times of our choosing, and partook in what was over there.  Then we came home to our all-white neighborhood.</p>
<p>When we visited diverse, multicultural cities, we spent as much time as we could in the parts of those cities where people were like us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, no one in my family ever ate a pita or could elucidate the difference between a tortilla and a tostada, but my family and our neighbors all came of age without ever being a victim of a violent crime or seeing police lights on our street.</p>

			<p><i>From the spot: &#8220;I grew up in an all-white neighborhood. So everyone was just like me. They looked like me, acted like me, and thought like me.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This is just engaging in the anti-white stereotype that all whites think alike. Since it&rsquo;s anti-white, its a stereotype that is A-OK. Of course anyone with an ounce of discernment will see through this. Why do identical twins have a bond between them that&rsquo;s unparalleled by other siblings? If diversity is so wonderful why don&rsquo;t we seek it out naturally? Why do we have to be preached at about how wonderful &#8220;diversity&#8221; is? </p>

			<p>Absolutely insulting.  Apparently it&rsquo;s impossible for whites to have a diversity of ideas or bring anything &#8216;new&rsquo; to the table.  Apparently only a black can think &#8216;black thoughts&rsquo; that whites are in such dire need of.  Somehow, whites have managed to house all the greatest philosophers, scientists, mathematicians, and artists without any diversity for thousands of years.  BUT all that is gone now, any white who still isn&rsquo;t surrounded by blacks, mexicans, asians and muslims today is incapable of having any thoughts about anything.</p>

			<p>Yes, diversity is great. Diversity is wonderful. Diversity spices up life. But this kind of &#8220;spice&#8221; only works when all the participants are clean, quiet, and law-abiding. And, all participants must be willing to adhere to one set of cultural norms, at least in public.  They can do almost anything else in the privacy of their respective homes, as long as they aren&rsquo;t harming some unwilling victim. Again, this goes back to the cultural norm. No one would give a rat&rsquo;s patootie about living next door to a family of blacks, Mexicans, Arabs, Laotian boat people or anyone else if they acted like you and I. I don&rsquo;t want my neighbors eating dogs in their backyards, which happened often enough in California that they passed laws in some municipalities criminalizing the eating of dogs. This is the true face of &#8220;diversity&#8221;. That commercial made me want to puke. </p>

			<p>This is by the far the funniest thing I&rsquo;ve heard in a long time!  Now diversity can give us a better career, as well as new ideas.  But I&rsquo;m still interested in hearing about these ideas and innovations that whites lack.  Maybe they were referring to murder, rape, and illegitimate children?</p>

1) The analogy of music is beyond absurd. People are not inanimate notes on a page.</p>
<p>2) I can assure you that NO ONE where I work enjoys workplace diversity especially for the guys in the stock room who have to fight with the blacks over what radio station they should listen to. This is also counter to the music analogy.</p>
<p>3) I can assure you that NO ONE in my neighborhood believes that our community is become better with the increase in diversity. The exact opposite is true. Everyone sees the writing on the wall and many people are fleeing for the safety of their families and to cash out on the value of their property before things get worse.</p>
<p>Pure propaganda. Orwell was a prophet.<br>

			<p>I think the Chinese immigrants in the San Gabriel Valley might disagree with this. It&rsquo;s always funny to me how successful immigrant groups such as the Chinese recognize that they need to form their own communities, while blacks and hispanics always need to integrate with Whites to become successful. That&rsquo;s really all this is, propaganda to get Whites to allow integration into their communities. You never hear Chinese, Koreans, or other Asian cultures cryiing about integration, its always the blacks and mestizos. </p>

			<p>The best way to destroy a country outside of military action is to destabalize it with the importation of various nationalities whose true allegiance is ALWAYS with their countries or origin, even into subsequent generations.</p>
<p>Homogeneity is the only system that works on a long term basis.  Beaking a nation up into squabbling tribal entities will cause its destruction as surely as a nuclear attack.</p>
<p>Diversity creates hostility, animosity and eventual break up.  Super powers are difficult to defeat militarily, but they can easily be destroyed by multiculturalizing their populations.  The process takes much longer, but success is guaranteed.<br>
All that is necessary in the beginning is to get the most gullible, the most foolish, to endorse the idea, because they believe it&rsquo;s in the interests of love and tolerance.</p>
<p>Since altruism, racial gullibility, and a desire to make foolish concessions, are necessary ingredients, only whites can fall victim to the absurdity that tearing their society apart is good for them.  Other races are not so foolish.</p>

			<p>From the absurd PSA:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grew up in an all white neighborhood&hellip;everyone I knew, was just like me&hellip;they looked like me, thought like me, acted like me&hellip;so my neighborhood always stayed the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grew up in a diverse neighborhood&hellip;everyone I knew brought something different to the party&hellip;they introduced me to different tastes, different ideas, and different ways of doing things&hellip;so my neighborhood always got more interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we are introduced to the &ldquo;Parallel Lives&rdquo; of an &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo; sheltered white  provincial and an &ldquo;enriched&rdquo; and &ldquo;urbane&rdquo; Hispanic. It is interesting that &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is seemingly, narrowly defined here to exclude ethnic diversity, in favor of racial diversity. That, or there were nothing but Anglo-Saxons in the all white neighborhood?</p>
<p>The poor deprived white fool, not even any Irish or Italians to hang out with; did his cloistered little world not even allow Celtic music or pizza parlors? Just imagine if a taco stand had opened there, those WASPs would have probably had to have the National Guard turned loose on them to reestablish order!</p>
<p>And thus, we come to the crux of this rather bizarre and sophomoric &ldquo;educational&rdquo; exercise in so-called diversity. It manages to be selective (dare we say discriminatory) as to just what diversity is; in its quest to be &ldquo;opened minded,&rdquo; it is ironically reduced to its own leftist stereotypes. I could note with disgust, &lsquo;how typical,&rsquo; but that would be rather unkind and gauche at this juncture.  </p>
<p>It suffices to note the droning message of the white harlot in the PSA, which seems to answer why &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is a &ldquo;strength:&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;A neighborhood rich in diversity can leave its inhabitants better off and more able to succeed in the global community we and our children will face in the years to come&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes indeed, global trading with an advanced knowledge of voodoo or santeria is always helpful, or at least we are to assume it &ldquo;can&rdquo; be.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!.</p>

<p>Considering all the benefits of diversity, I want to know what efforts are being taken to bring this blessing to African nations.  Perhaps their lack of racial diversity is one cause of the poverty, strife and disease that plagues them.</p>

			<p>But a massive new study, based on detailed interviews of nearly 30,000 people across America, has concluded just the opposite. Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam   &mdash;   famous for &#8220;Bowling Alone,&#8221; his 2000 book on declining civic engagement   &mdash;   has found that the greater the diversity in a community, the fewer people vote and the less they volunteer, the less they give to charity and work on community projects. In the most diverse communities, neighbors trust one another about half as much as they do in the most homogenous settings. The study, the largest ever on civic engagement in America, found that virtually all measures of civic health are lower in more diverse settings.</p>
<p>&#8220;The extent of the effect is shocking,&#8221; says Scott Page, a University of Michigan political scientist.</p>

			<p>From the NFHA home page: &#8220;We believe it is the right of us all to live in healthy, diverse communities and that we all deserve to benefit from the richer life they bring.&#8221;</p>
<p>This should really read: &#8220;We believe you should all be FORCED to live in diverse communities with lots of minorities who hate whites with a passion and if you don&rsquo;t want to we&rsquo;ll make you, anyway. (This policy does not apply to the executives at our corporate sponsors who live in million dollar mansions in gated communities).&#8221;</p>
<p>Seriously, someone whould find out where the executives of the corporations that sponsor the NFHA live (Wachovia, State Farm, Nationwide, H&R; Block, etc.) and see how diverse their neighborhoods are.</p>

			<p>Yeah, we shouldn&rsquo;t live in boring, homogenous all White neighborhoods.</p>
<p>True diversity:</p>
<p>Minnesota with diverse population of Swedes, Norwegians, Finns, Germans - maybe a few WASPs as long as they don&rsquo;t try to run for public office.</p>
<p>New York, Boston and Phily</p>
<p>Proud, tough Italian, Irish even some Portuguese White working class neighborhoods. English Yankee Whites are at the top making sure the place is prosperous, just don&rsquo;t let the Yankee/WASP types get involved in Police or Fire Department stuff. Jewish people also live in these great White cities, they cause some problems but are on balance happy to be living here and not in some Arab Muslim country and few White Jewish people are Communists, maybe a few, not too many.</p>
<p>Utah, Oregon, Nevada full of diverse populations of White Americans, LDS Mormons. Extremely low crime rate, high birth rates, the White Protestant Christians especially the Baptists resent the success of the LDS Mormons - go to great lengths to say that Mormons aren&rsquo;t real Christians. Well, with such diverse populations there are bound to be differences, conflicts - Diversity has it&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>In California - it&rsquo;s mostly an all White State, only sharp divides between White liberals, Leftists, Hippies, New Agers and White Conservative military folks. Yeah the ideological divide is strong, but the whole state looks like beautiful California GIrls, Beach Boys types - maybe a few Spaniards, Chileans high class White Mexicans thrown in the mix to add some more spice/diversity. Very few Black African American gang bangers in CA - too expensive, prefer to live in the South&hellip; Southern part of Africa.</p>
<p>In the American South = the diversity is a mix of proud White good ol boys, unreconstructed Confederate Rebels and White Yankees, Northerners moved down South for the warmer climate, lower taxes and to be honest, to get away from feminist Northern Yankee women like Hillary. Lots of conflict between the White Southerners and the invading White Yankees, local White Southerners complain the White Yankees are coming down to go for the White Southern Women - this is true. I am one of those White Nothern Yankees coming down south to go for the White Southern women.</p>
<p>So you see, America in our idealized world is very diverse - lots of different cultures all great. All White European based and all, cherished branches of our indo European American family.</p>
<p>Love this type of diversity.</p>

			<p>This radio advertisement gets it wrong. Whites are actually very intellectually diverse. How many non-Whites do you see in fringe parties like the Green or Libertarian parties? The food may be more diverse in diverse areas, but people can come from non-diverse areas to other more homogeneous areas within a country to experience that. And preparing for the future by living in a diverse area doesn&rsquo;t make sense since the culture of Chinese-Americans and other immigrant communities and ethnic Americans are significantly different than the places they come from. Diversity has become like religion. </p>

			<p>I grew up in an all white neighbourhood, pleasant, peaceful, low crime. Nothing to complain about. Having no experiences of ethnic &#8216;minorities&rsquo; just the usual media endorsement and recommendation, I was wide eyed and innocent, keen to experience at first hand the benefits of diversity. A few years later, my work took me to a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; and &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; city, London.  Having been &#8216;enriched&rsquo;,  I am now very very happy to be again in an almost exclusively white area.  Little things like walking in public with a camera or using a mobile phone in a public place without worrying about being assaulted or losing it are now possible again. There is no way I would subject my children to the stress, fear and harassment that, in my experience, come with a multicultural environment.</p>
<p>To any multiculturalists I&rsquo;d recommend a few years in one of your multicultural multi ethnic paradises. You&rsquo;ll discover what I did, for the most part your beloved ethnics hate you because of your race. They might seem pleasant on the surface, but as soon as you have a disagreement with them the façade collapses. They are obsessed with their ethnicity and their victimhood. There may well be exceptions, but this model seemed the norm to me, and even if I&rsquo;m wrong and it&rsquo;s just a minority who are like this, that &#8216;minority&rsquo; make their environments extremely unpleasant and hazardous for those they despise.</p>
<p>The worst part is that those who  profess to hate this country and its indigenous people, are queuing up to get into the country by any means possible. They are being assisted, for the most part, by clueless middle-class do-gooders like I was. Our prisons, and everybody else&rsquo;s are full of them for a reason.</p>

And another thing&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;No news is good news&#8221;.</p>
<p>I want to live in the most boring neighborhood I can. I don&rsquo;t want to hear or read about any &#8216;excitement&rsquo; that happened over night, or over the weekend, or down the street. I don&rsquo;t want my friend around the block telling me (as one did just yesterday) that the &#8216;diverse&rsquo; family living behind them has been breaking down her fence to gain access to her backyard causing her dogs to escape and nearly be taken away by animal protection who were loading them into their van when they were found wondering around a major artery.</p>
<p>I can live with a boring neighborhood and prefer to do so.</p>
<p>Give me a boring neighborhood any day.<br>

			<p>I sent the following to the morons that ran this ad.</p>
<p>Your ad that insults whites and insinuates all whites think alike is a joke to any caucasian person in America. I love my white neighborhood. We never see police lights lighting up our neighborhood. We don&rsquo;t have gun shots ringing out at all times of the day. We can sit in our yards and leave our doors unlocked and not worry about crime. Why is it if whites live in a white neighborhood it is racist but, it is a celebration to go into any other ethnic neighborhood? You are a sad group and everytime you or someone like you tries to push such an agenda down the throats of whites it only reenforces our own beliefs. I don&rsquo;t have to live in a mixed neighborhood to know what another culture is like. I don&rsquo;t have to live on Mars to know it is uninhabitable. </p>

			<p>&#8220;This radio advertisement gets it wrong. Whites are actually very intellectually diverse. How many non-Whites do you see in fringe parties like the Green or Libertarian parties? The food may be more diverse in diverse areas, but people can come from non-diverse areas to other more homogeneous areas within a country to experience that. And preparing for the future by living in a diverse area doesn&rsquo;t make sense since the culture of Chinese-Americans and other immigrant communities and ethnic Americans are significantly different than the places they come from. Diversity has become like religion.&#8221; <br>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got it right on, guy.  There&rsquo;s enough &#8220;diversity&#8221; in any group to satisfy any race&rsquo;s desire for differences.</p>
<p>Diversity HAS become a religion, or more correctly, a sect or cult.  Just as the Jones followers lined up to drink the Kool Aid, so too have the most gullible bought into the diversity cult, lock, stock and barrel. </p>
<p>How many times have we seen those within the multicult group chain themselves together, cry and hug, screeching hysterically, with tears running down their cheeks, while others wear stocking masks, intending to engage in criminal acts, all simply because they want to prevent another point of view from being heard?   </p>
<p>Those types are no different than the Jones cultists, nor are they any different than the cult who committed group suicide recently because their mother ship never arrived to take them to Saturn where a colony awaited them.  The only difference between these like-minded people is the ism which they embrace.</p>
<p>To those of us not prone to blindly embracing such nonsense, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to understand how people can be so gullible, but gullible they are, in fact to the point of being a danger to the rest of us.</p>
<p>It is these types that have been the weak link in the white race.  It is they who have stupidly made devastating concessions to our enemies, while failing to perceive their manipulations and conniving.  There are those like that who rale against blacks on this forum, yet are susceptible to be duped by them, because they&rsquo;re so gullible.<br>

			<p>&#8220;I can assure you that NO ONE where I work enjoys workplace diversity especially for the guys in the stock room who have to fight with the blacks over what radio station they should listen to.&#8221;</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe they fight over the radio. I thought everyone just gives in and listens to the black station?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;You never hear Chinese, Koreans, or other Asian cultures cryiing about integration, its always the blacks and mestizos.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is only partly true in that black and hispanics don&rsquo;t want You in Their neighborhoods and are more than willing to take desperate measures to keep you out. </p>
<p>I WISH all whites thought alike, but that&rsquo;s not true and we have very little reason to trust them. It&rsquo;s said someone is free if they believe the same thing everyone else does.  </p>

			<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve stopped laughing-</p>
<p>They got one thing right: racially diverse areas are certainly more &#8220;interesting&#8221; than predominately white ones. When I first began working, and later living, in Baltimore, whoo boy! I learned just how &#8220;interesting&#8221; things can get. Having to be constantly aware of who&rsquo;s around or who might be following you sure does keep one&rsquo;s attention keen. Playing &#8220;guess the caliber&#8221; with roommates or coworkers over a beer at night does wonders to keep the dullness at bay.</p>
<p>Not at all like boring, 97% white Carroll county (at least it was when I was growing up). No street crime, no locking the doors after dark, nothing. Other than the regular DUIs and occasional barfights, the cops were terribly underworked. Hell, for years we neither had nor needed a county police department! Just a MD state police barracks and Westminster city. </p>
<p>What a snore.</p>
<p>But hey, several of the towns in the area are picking up lots of excess diversity from Baltimore and DC, and the crime stats are showing it! Maybe there&rsquo;s hope for Cow County to become more &#8220;interesting&#8221; yet!</p>

			<p>My Methodist grandmother used to describe to me with disapproval the practice of the Baptists in baptizing by complete immersion. Her Methodist church more genteelly  sprinkled a little water on the  baptized&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>As a child, I was amazed at such a gulf (the Baptist rite, as she described it, seemed almost other-worldly), and never imagined that some day I might be exposed to even greater diversity.</p>

<i>&#8220;I find it hard to believe they fight over the radio. I thought everyone just gives in and listens to the black station?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Yes, fight is too strong a term. Generally it&rsquo;s sniping back and forth when one group leaves the stockroom and the others change the station. It&rsquo;s never an out and out fight of anger (though there&rsquo;s anger and resentment). It&rsquo;s an exercise in upping each other when one side is dominant. As far as I know, no one has yet walked over and turned the radio to another station when members of the other group are present. But when they leave, the radio is up for grabs and when the other group comes back and the station is changed, there&rsquo;s the old &#8216;oh man&hellip;&rsquo;. What keeps it from descending into anarchy is a non-nonsense boss who they know will throw the radio in the compactor the second it becomes an issue. Diversity appears to &#8216;work&rsquo; only because of the threat from a strong authoritarian leader.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there&rsquo;s even one guy who thinks he&rsquo;s being neutral by turning on the classical music station. He can&rsquo;t work in silence; he has to have music playing so he thinks classical is a compromise.<br>

<p>&gt; Good post and truer than you think!  I sometimes remind Amren readers that I lived in Slovenia for a couple years.  Everyone was Slovenian, (Well some other Yugos were around, but they don&rsquo;t count).  They had jokes for people who lived in the next valley or town.  There were some real town vs town rivalries, but most of it was among young men while others laughed about it.  Village sports teams are very serious, however.</p>
<p>When I was preparing for my wedding there, I asked a Serbian woman who worked for me about her cultures wedding traditions.  She began by saying that it used to be a great shame to marry outside of the village you grew up in.  (So some traditions of bride stealing and sister selling exist only as a symbolic game/rite today).  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sick of articles about how great diversity is and no real explanation of why.  You have a country like the US that&rsquo;s been great for most of its history without it and then some liberals in the government decide to let vast numbers of aliens in the country.  They tell us we&rsquo;re better off for it yet anyone who&rsquo;s over 40 knows that not the case.  The real truth is that as  the country grows more diverse, the less great it is.  If it&rsquo;s not stopped these often hostile aliens will outnumber us and start dictating to us on their terms.  These people pushing this diversity propaganda must be lunatics.  The only logical reason I can conclude is that this is some sinister scheme to eradicate us Whites.</p>

			<p>When I was in the hole for &#8220;fighting&#8221; in the Denver County Jail in 2001, the deputies used to play classic rock &amp; roll.  The blacks complained this was &#8220;racist&#8221;.  As a &#8220;dangerous&#8221; individual, I was watched by the guards while going to take showers.  I asked one of the nice ones to play some country &amp; western.  I was well-behaved, and my &#8220;fight&#8221; had consisted of my ducking under my attacker&rsquo;s punch, so he broke every bone in his hand on my forehead.  Hitting a Scotsman in his head with anything other than a rifle bullet is a waste of time.  I refused to press charges, while his hand swelled up.  He needed surgery to save it.  With country &amp; western on in the unit for a few days, they thought classic rock &amp; roll was just fine.</p>
<p>I sang along with the music: &#8220;Well it&rsquo;s 40 below and I don&rsquo;t give a f-, got a heater in my truck and it&rsquo;s off to the rodeo&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>Just ask anyone who lived in a formerly all White neighborhood in any city what it was like before diversity struck and after.<br>
Let&rsquo;s take the North Penn (sometimes known as Swampoodle) section of Philadelphia for example (the following limits are rough estimates)bounded by Allgeheny Ave. on the north and by Lehigh Avenue on the south and by Broad street on the east and by 33rd. street on the west.<br>
Before:<br>
1. People really could leave doors unlocked at night.<br>
2. People really did sleep on their front porch gliders or chaise lounges on hot nights in the summer before air conditioning became commonplace.<br>
3. If as a kid you did something &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; several blocks away your parents were waiting in ambush for you when you got home.<br>
4. Everyone knew his neighbors and looked out for them.<br>
5. Serious disputes between neighbors resulted in mutual shunning rather than in assault and murder.  My family didn&rsquo;t speak to the family two houses away but we kids still played together all the time.<br>
6. Everyone with whom I was acquainted could identify all their relatives and family lines were clearly drawn.<br>
7. Although many people owned firearms, the peace of evening was never disturbed by the sound of gunfire. Shotguns were sold at the local hardware store.<br>
8. WE had block parties in the summer where everyone contributed food and entertainment.<br>
9. Although we were far from perfect none of us was ever afraid to walk the streets at night.<br>
10. The only  fire I remember was one that started in my neighbor&rsquo;s kitchen due to carelessness with cooking oil. Neighbors rushed to her aid and extinguished it within minutes with little resultant damage. </p>
<p>After <br>
1. Frequent fires.<br>
2. Assaults, armed robberies and B &amp; E.<br>
3. Rapes and attempted rapes.<br>
4. Gunshots.<br>
5. Doors being locked and bars being installed on basement windows.<br>
5. Sale signs springing up everywhere.<br>
6. Eventual loss of property value, the loss of the unique character and the eventual death of the neighborhood.<br>
 <br>
We still have reunions every few years and talk about how we miss the &#8220;old neighborhood&#8221; and how &#8220;different&#8221; it is where we now live.</p>
