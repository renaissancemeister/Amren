<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>After Frank Igwe picked up his doctoral diploma at Penn State in May, he promptly handed <br>
it to his parents. He wants them to see it at home &#8220;and know that their son made a mark <br>
in this world, bringing honor to the family name.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more &#8220;family&#8221; for Mr. Igwe to thank for supporting him through the crucible <br>
of graduate school: The PhD Project, a mentoring network for African-Americans, <br>
Hispanics, and native Americans on the path to becoming business professors.</p>
<p>Since its formation in 1994, The PhD Project has helped triple representation of these <br>
groups among the faculty of American business schools – from 294 to 903. Another 400 are <br>
working toward their doctorates.</p>
<p>That signals &#8220;tremendous growth,&#8221; says Thomas Kochan, a professor at Massachusetts <br>
Institute of Technology&rsquo;s Sloan School of Management in Cambridge. &#8220;Too often, <br>
underrepresented minorities don&rsquo;t have access to those networks [in academia], so this <br>
provides more of a leveling effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Universities still have a long way to go to bring a wide range of backgrounds to business <br>
teaching and research, experts say. The three minority groups represent less than 4 <br>
percent of the roughly 26,000 business professors with PhDs.</p>
<p>With so few role models, many minorities don&rsquo;t even consider a PhD, preferring instead <br>
the more popular MBA – until they&rsquo;re drawn in by the project&rsquo;s recruitment web. Each <br>
year, the nonprofit invites potential career-changers to an introductory, <br>
all-expenses-paid conference where professors, deans, and current minority doctoral <br>
students demystify the PhD pursuit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With funding from university and corporate sponsors, The PhD Project pays each year for <br>
minority doctoral students to meet in advance of national professional conferences in <br>
particular disciplines such as accounting and management. But the network operates <br>
year-round. That helps explain the project&rsquo;s 92 percent completion rate, compared with <br>
about 70 percent overall for business doctoral programs, Milano says.</p>

					<p>  This project is discriminatory against whites and Asians.<br>
  Someone needs to sue them for discrimination using the same rulings and the same arguements which are advanced in the successful pro-minority law suits.<br><br>
  Any white who donates time or money to groups like this should be treated as an enemy because government already favors minorities and white should counter government and institutional discrimionation with their private acts.<br><br>
  If it were truely according to ability I would not care but it is minority racism and anti-white government actions like this which prevent many whites from advancing. That is real institutional racism against whites and sometimes asians.<br><br>

It&rsquo;s hard to see what harm having more &#8220;Black&#8221; professorships in our business schools could do. Nothing seems to work very well in America now anyway. It couldn&rsquo;t be much worse with a few more.</p>

					<p>&#8220;That signals &ldquo;tremendous growth,&rdquo; says Thomas Kochan, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology&rsquo;s Sloan School of Management in Cambridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, that signals more affirmative action in both admittance and grades. I read an article the other day from an academic that complained that he and the school were pressed to have X number of black undergrauates, plus X number of advanced degrees.</p>
<p>Not many would complain of black accomplishment if it were legitimate, but &#8220;legitimate&#8221; to blacks means awarding them things.  And if you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re racist.</p>
<p>Certification without merit creates an expanding bubble, filled with a gas that could well be dangerously toxic to any society.  Look what is happening in Africa.</p>

					<p>Just another liberal program that is destined to fail, and along with it pull down students who could possibly become productive citizens, the liberals are batting near perfect rate of failed programs in the educational field, they have taken our once admired and world leading education system in America and turned it into a laughing stock, surpassed by 3rd world countries, I am beginning to wonder if its not to late.</p>

					<p>The companies <span class="caps">KBR, CSA </span>and <span class="caps">ITT </span>working here in the middle east and elsewhere on military contracts are beginniing to be very black top heavy in supervisors and all levels of management. In my 5 years over here I can also say that the military leadership is overall dissatisfied with the performance of these companiesin any area of work. This is <span class="caps">NOT </span>a personal opinion though I know it to be true. I have read many resumes professing to have verious degrees and some even presenting the credentials to prove it. Between the paper the degree was written on and their ability, it would seem the piece of paper had more value since I could at least use the back side for scribbling notes to self.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Too often, underrepresented minorities don&rsquo;t have access to those networks [in academia], so this provides more of a leveling effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why talk about imaginary leveling effects (which are proudly based on naked racism - having blacks learn from other blacks)&hellip; why talk about these imaginary effects when you could talk about very real leveling effects such as affirmative action? </p>
<p>Less than 4% of <span class="caps">PHD&rsquo;</span>s come from these endangered groups, and yet &#8216;903&rsquo; of the faculty of America&rsquo;s business schools are made up from them. </p>
<p>Did white&rsquo;s apply for these university jobs too? Do the numbers (if not the article here) suggest whites who applied for these jobs have an ironclad <span class="caps">EEO </span>case?</p>
<p>Myself, I&rsquo;m not that good at math. Perhaps these &#8216;potential career-changers&rsquo; or their corporate sponsors can get right to work on those numbers. </p>

					<p>For a country where race is not supposed to matter, there sure is a great deal of effort to benefit members of non-white races. Actions speak louder than words: therefore, the real meaning is that the white races is not supposed to matter   &mdash;   indeed, it is to be defeated. </p>
<p>How it is that deluded young white adults think that this country is interested in their success and personal welfare is beyond my understanding.</p>

					<p>Governments in Soviet-dominated part of Europe used to do this kind of &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; for the benefit of the poor by printing more and more money in order to increase the lowest incomes.</p>
<p>The result wasn&rsquo;t exactly what their intention were: inflation and devaluation.</p>
<p>Expect the same here. I predict that the value of a Ph.D. degree will sink as a result of that &#8220;boost&#8221;.</p>

					<p>Let&rsquo;s see now. I had to work all day for 18 years and go to night school to get my three degrees which I paid for myself. When I reached middle-age, my job was outsourced to a nice Indian who does a poor job of it for about forty cents on the dollar. </p>
<p>But the black got a taxpayer subsidized free ride through college as a full time student all the way to their masters degree and now the modern liberal wants to put me in the back of the bus and give them a free PhD!</p>
<p>To top it off, I&rsquo;m a minority in my state. Where I live whites are a minority. </p>
<p>It really is a political war against the white middle aged male. They must really hate us.  </p>

					<p>Thrasymachus,</p>
<p>I totally agree!</p>
<p>One of the big questions that got me to change my thinking was, how does diversity and multi-culturalism benefit my kids and offspring?</p>
<p>The answer:  It doesn&rsquo;t! It has the opposite effect.  </p>
<p>On another note:  It appears to me that over time US corporations will lose their edge on the global scale because they&rsquo;re shackled with PC issues and hiring AA/diversity candidates.  This being the case, how can you create a top quality product when your work force is made up of people who are giving jobs they&rsquo;re unqualified for?</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that US education is awful and most of these wonderful diverse people won&rsquo;t ever go to High School and most of them won&rsquo;t make it into college.  How can you have a 1st world country with a work force like this?  You can&rsquo;t!</p>

					<p>Corporate donors have to make sure universities, black colleges, government jobs and minority business initiatives are filled up with people of color, then they can claim their company doesn&rsquo;t have enough diversity and blanket affirmative action and sensitivity training is required.</p>

					<p>Is Professor Thomas Kochan&rsquo;s next equitable( leveling ) race project to design a &#8221; mentoring project &#8221; to have much greater representation of white majority in professional team sports, especially basketball ? I can&rsquo;t believe a liberal,aka, communist, especially a white one, would be a racial hypocrite in Western countries.</p>
