						<p>The SA Post Office is trying to contact internet retailer Amazon.com for further details on why it offers limited shipping facilities to South Africa after a report that this was due to theft.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a surprise .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  unexpected,&#8221; said Post Office spokesman Lungile Lose on a report in Business Day that theft had made the retailer decide that deliveries to South Africa would have to be done by private courier costing around R400.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will still want to speak to them so that we can pick up where the root is and we will take it up with the Universal Postal Union,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Items from Amazon passed through other international postal service providers from their depots around the world so they would like to talk to Amazon.com about which part of the route was problematic.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an important customer,&#8221; said Lose.</p>
<p>He said that for the period 2007/2008 there had been 1,699 reports of mail theft and that there was a 99 percent success rate when pursuing these cases.</p>
<p>The Post Office had installed specialist technology, including cameras at sorting centres, and had established a crime and ethics line for postal workers to report any suspicious behaviour.</p>
<p>Further details from Amazon.com were not immediately available.<br>

															<h2>Postal Theft Infuriates Amazon</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Times (Johannesburg), June 18, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Rampant theft by Post Office workers has infuriated internet retailing giant Amazon so much that it will no longer send goods to South Africa by post, Business Day has reported.</p>
<p>Anyone wanting to order directly from the US-based website must now pay for a private courier service adding about R420 to the price of a DVD.</p>
<p>No one from the Post Office would comment.</p>
<p>No other African country&rsquo;s postal service had been blacklisted by Amazon, Business Day said.<br>

<p>Look at the GOOD side! As South Africa more and more implements its &#8220;progressive&#8221; race policies, the worth of the South African Rand will decline and (all things being equal) private courier services for delivering DVD&rsquo;s will decline in cost when one adjusts for race.</p>

			<p>Many years ago a politician commented that any black run business will fail because the owners will steal from each other into bankcruptcy.Most white people who work with blacks do not understand what happens when they might not be around.Blacks behave themselves as long as whites are around to moderate their behavior.But once they are in control blacks tend to give in to their baser instincts.Look at Martin Luther King memorial Hospital in L.A.</p>

			<p>Considering the &#8216;respect&rsquo; Black Africans have for private property, I&rsquo;d be surprised ANY FIRM would trust valuable shipments to South African mails! But not to fret&hellip; More than a few Black American postal workers have been charged with pilfering American mails while doing their jobs. One might suppose the tendency of Blacks to drift criminal behavior is so deeply ingrained in their psyche, most Blacks will NEVER hope to rise above themselves.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve heard so many stories about missing and stolen mail around big, occupied US cities such as Chicago and Detroit.  The same for sending packages to Mexico. It may get through, but it will often arrive with some items missing.     </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve become callous in my quasi-old age, but I want South Africa to crash and to crash hard. I want it&rsquo;s failure to be a shining example to the world of the failure of leftist/Marxist/multiculturalist policies. I want the racists Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu to see the nation their policies have created; to see that South African whites were right to want separation from blacks. I want rock stars like Bono to hut up for two seconds and see that their crusade was as devastating and idiotic as George W Bush&rsquo;s Iraq crusade.</p>

			<p>How do they know they just weren&rsquo;t lost through inefficiency?  This reminds me of the AP story last summer when Mellon Bank had to pay over $16 million to settle a case:  &#8220;The bank, a subsidiary of Mellon Financial Corp., had a contract with the Internal Revenue Service to process income tax returns and tax-payment checks. Mellon employees, feeling overworked and unable to meet deadlines imposed by the contract, destroyed more than 77,000 returns and checks totaling $1.3 billion at a company service center in Pittsburgh in April 2001.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Here in Britain it is mainly gangs of Somalis and other Africans who are involved in postal theft. For a short period I worked in a mail centre in England and it was always the Africans and Indians who would go up to the canteen to sleep during their shifts. The place often looked like a Congolese refugee camp. Even when they were awake, their work rate was awful. But, as the mantra goes, &#8220;diversity creates excellence&#8221;, and we all felt positively enriched by their noble African traditions *Puke*. </p>

			<p>(from the article): <i>The Post Office had installed specialist technology, including cameras at sorting centres, and had established a crime and ethics line for postal workers to report any suspicious behaviour.</i></p>
<p>And in other news, the Agriculture Ministry established a hotline allowing foxes to report suspicious activities in and near henhouses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health said it is &#8220;looking into the possibility&#8221; of recruiting vampires as security guards at area blood banks.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve had various family members live (temporarily) in some backwoods locales all over the world: China, Zambia, Russia, and a few other places. Always ended up mailing them care packages. The stuff to China and Russia always got through, completely untouched, but getting stuff through the Zambian Post Office was hellish. Things went missing, and they wanted absurd amounts for &#8220;customs&#8221; compared to what the shipment was worth. After the second package I decided not to bother.</p>

			<p>No surprises here.  In around 2001/2002 the incidence of theft from the main post office in Johannesburg reached such epidemic proportions that the so-called management (together with a security company) set up a sting operation to film the thieves in action.</p>
<p>When enough evidence had been gathered, the ringleaders were busted (ah, those were the days &hellip;) and hauled into court.</p>
<p>Guess what?  The thieves all bleated that their &#8220;Hoomin Rights&#8221; had been trampled upon and that their privacy had been invaded illegally.</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<p>All charges were dropped, all cases were thrown out and the security cameras were removed by order of the court.  This is NOT a joke.  The whole story received a lot of coverage in the local press at the time. </p>
<p>A few months later it was revealed that the British govt. was no longer using the South African postal system to deliver pension cheques to the Brit citizens residing in South Africa as the postal drones (I refuse to call them workers) were plundering the OHMS envelopes and cashing the cheques.  All Brit pension cheques were subsequently delivered by private courier companies.</p>

			<p>Totally agree with Tony Soprano. at 6:40 PM on June 18 </p>
<p>When I bought into a small business, the accountant took me aside and warned me: 25% of partnerships of white men fail because one is a cheat (yeah, he&rsquo;d discovered our cheat). He said 80% of white women&rsquo;s partnerships fail for the same reason.</p>
<p>99% of non-whites fail he said, because they cheat each other AND the tax man. Now that&rsquo;s a bad idea I think&hellip;</p>
