<h1>US Lawmakers Want Mandela off Terror List</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, June 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some U.S. lawmakers are trying to pass legislation to remove former South African President Nelson Mandela from a U.S. list of terrorists by his 90th birthday next month, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lawmakers in April introduced legislation in Congress to remove Mandela from the list, a step that is normally a government administrative matter, because they were frustrated by the time the process was taking.</p>
<p>The State Department has said it and the Justice Department fully support the bill, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 8 and is awaiting Senate approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been able to clarify and resolve certain questions that were hanging in the minds of some people as to whether to support the process or not,&#8221; Nhlapo [Welile Nhlapo, South African Ambassador to the United States] said without elaborating.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying ourselves to talk to some of these people, clarify what else they may have on their mind &hellip; so that we can get this over,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The former South African president and some in the now-ruling African National Congress are still blacklisted under U.S. laws and need special permission to enter the United States more than a decade after the apartheid struggle ended.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ANC was banned by South Africa&rsquo;s white rulers in 1960, its leaders jailed or forced into exile until the ban on the movement was lifted 30 years later.</p>
<p>Strict security measures passed by Congress after the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United States kept the ANC&rsquo;s &#8220;terrorist&#8221; label because it used armed force as part of its campaign against apartheid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Donald Payne, a New Jersey Democrat, told the Africa Society late on Wednesday that removing organizations from the terrorist list was an administrative matter that had taken too long, adding: &#8220;We&rsquo;re trying to make sure that he is not a terrorist when we celebrate his 90th birthday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mandela was jailed for 27 years for his struggle against apartheid, and has become a worldwide symbol of freedom. He was hailed for overseeing the peaceful transition from white to black rule as South Africa&rsquo;s first post-apartheid era president.<br/>
