						<p>Los Angeles&rsquo; two top lawmen are increasingly at odds over the extent to which gang violence is being fueled by racial hatred.</p>
<p>Police Chief William J. Bratton and his top deputies have long cautioned that race-motivated violence remains fairly rare and that gang feuds over turf and drugs are the leading causes of such violence.</p>
<p>But over the last few months, Sheriff Lee Baca has publicly voiced a more ominous view of violence between Latino and black gangs. This week, he went further than ever, saying in a Los Angeles Times opinion piece that &ldquo;some of L.A.&rsquo;s so-called gangs are really no more than loose-knit bands of blacks or Latinos roaming the streets looking for people of the other color to shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baca&rsquo;s comments have prompted debate in law enforcement circles &mdash; with some Los Angeles Police Department officials questioning some of his assertions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Times examination of slayings in 2007 largely backed Bratton&rsquo;s assertion about the racial factor in gang killings. The Times analyzed the circumstances of 562 Latino and black homicides from 2007 in which the race of the suspects was known, including all LAPD and sheriff&rsquo;s cases, plus those of smaller police agencies such as Long Beach and Inglewood. The analysis found that nearly 90% of both black and Latino homicide victims had been killed by suspects of their own race.</p>
<p>The issue has been particularly sensitive for Bratton and his command staff in recent months.</p>
<p>Faced with a serious rise in the homicide rate in the early part of the year and several high-profile killings, Bratton, Beck and others battled media reports and public perception that the violence was racially motivated. In one instance, Bratton angrily confronted a television news reporter who challenged the chief&rsquo;s stance on the issue. Bratton&rsquo;s assertion that the high number of killings was an anomaly has been largely borne out as the homicide rate has fallen significantly in recent months.</p>

			<p>Bratton is a sycophantic, liberal Eastern transplant, who is so in the pocket of the Los Angeles Mayor and reconquista, Villaraigossa, the developers, and Hollywood liberals it is sickening. Having been a native of Los Angeles County for most of my life, I have noticed that Sheriff Baca is a fair and for a County Sheriff at least, as objective a person as one can be. No doubt he is in hot water right now  &mdash;  FOR TELLING THE TRUTH. This is what the massive invasion from mainly Mexico, but elsewhere also, is doing to this nation. There are those officials like Sheriff Baca, who have integrity and should be honored, then their are the Chief Bratton types.</p>

			<p>How can Chief Bratton say that with a straight face?  He cannot be serious, me thinks.  As a white police chief, he has no other choice than to maintain racial neutrality, even when his counterpart (who is &#8220;latino&#8221;) says the exact opposite.  For those who don&rsquo;t know, LAPD patrols within LA city limits, but the LA Sheriff&rsquo;s Dept. has jurisdiction throughout LA county.  Additionally, the Sheriffs maintain the jail system.</p>
<p>So if you want to know what goes on inside the jails, ask a deputy Sheriff.  Bratton knows the real deal, though.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know what part of town Bratton moved to when he came out here from Boston, but its unlikely to be South LA or the Compton/Long Beach area. He&rsquo;s safe.</p>

			<p>Bratton is a standard red diaper grandbaby.  It&rsquo;s like he has liberal propaganda implanted in his brain.</p>
<p>Baca is a realist.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is all whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>

			<p>I grew up in a area where Latinos were the majority. I had many Latino friends as a boy and still do today. Almost without exception they loathe blacks. This was true 30 years ago and still holds true today. Just the way it is and no government &#8220;spin&#8221; will change this fact.</p>

			<p>20, 30 and 40 years ago, whites fled to the suburbs to escape the blacks. Now blacks are fleeing the Hispanics. Soon the cities will all be filled with non-English speaking foreigners. Did I say soon? No, It&rsquo;s already happened.</p>

			<p>575 young men killed in the last year in L.A. This makes it more dangerous to be walking aroung in Watts or Normandy Blvd, than in Takrit Iraq. I love those who want us all, &#8221; To just get along.&#8221; These fools are always eager to want a dis-armed populace.<br>
     Sensitivity training, job counseling, or esteem building doesn`t seem to make brothers Y hermanos stop killing one another. I know the cure. Bring back the draft and get every swinging Jose or Barak off the turf and into basic training.<br>

			<p>I say don&rsquo;t bring back the draft. Pat Buchanan is right. We need to stop spending fortunes becoming involved in foreign entanglements that do not benefit our national interest. </p>
<p>Plus, they have had some problems here in Los Angeles with some of these gangmembers that joined coming back and using their military training.</p>
<p>Pat believes we should end chain migration and illegal immigration in a very real and final way and deporting the illegals back across a very secure border is the first step to restoring order. The second step is offering reparations to Americans that wish to go back to Africa or Mexico. Hopefully, this creates shortages in the number of laborers offering an opportunity to end public assistance for the tens of millions of able bodied Americans that live in poverty right now. </p>
<p>All of this would be good for the country on many levels. Check out the 7/1/2008 article titled &#8216;A Modern Liberal Response to Illegal Immigration&rsquo; at The Paleo Conservatist when it comes out in a week. It&rsquo;s going to be very informative people.</p>

			<p>What these &#8220;geniuses&#8221; fail to grasp is that the killers happen to be BLACKS AND HISPANICS! But please&hellip; WHY the surprise. Blacks have been killing each other in the large northern cities for generations. (Maybe Nature&rsquo;s way of culling the population or something.)</p>
<p>Blacks and Mexicans are simply vying for the [dis]honor of being considered the LOWEST HUMAN RACE ON THE PLANET or similar title.</p>
<p>Considering BOTH racial groups are not known for high I.Q., both racial groups are fueeling themselves with cheap liquor and cheap drugs, are steeping what little brains they do have in that slop (RAP) music, what really would we expect of them? That gangsta culture of Blacks, the undeniable reality Blacks worldwide are just as psychopathic and pathological failures as their American counterparts.</p>
<p>The reality is the damned liberals can&rsquo;t accept the premise that both Mexicans and Blacks are vastly inferior mentally to Whites. That their proclivity for a life of crime appears very much to be genetic rather than from social causes. Remember, BLACKS WORLDWIDE are just as given to crime and senseless violence as those in California or any other American location. A reality amply verifiable by what we see, hear and read in the news. But plese remember: It is most politically incorrect to utter this undeniable truth!</p>

********<br>
They are already armed, do you really want to teach them how to shoot straight? Besides the soldiers need someone they can trust watching their back in areas of conflict  &mdash;  not someone who is just as likely to turn on them. Must as the thought appeals at first, more consideration makes it less and less desireable.</p>

<p>They may &#8220;loathe&#8221; blacks, but Latino youth are also some of, if not the, most hardcore imitators of black/hiphop culture. Much more so than white kids.</p>
<p>They also miscegenate with blacks at much higher rates than whites.</p>

<p>Blacks and Mexicans are ingrates too. You can give them the shirt off your back, and how will they reciprocate? They&rsquo;ll steal your pants&hellip; yep, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll do!!! :-)</p>

<p>Those are reparations I can be in favor of! I guess the relevant factor is how &#8216;reparations&rsquo; are defined. </p>
