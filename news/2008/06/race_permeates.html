<h1>Race Permeates Society, Hides in Different Disguises</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Greeley, Chicago Sun-Times, June 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. Barack Obama&rsquo;s victory, we are told by the cheering sections, was a great victory for the American dream. Racism may well be in retreat. In the immortal words of Humphrey Bogart: Not so fast, Louis. The United States looks pretty good now &mdash; for a change. What if Obama is defeated? The whole world and most African Americans will scream &#8220;racism!&#8221; Better not to try at all than to try and fail.</p>
<p>In fact, only a little more than half of the Democratic voters chose the senator from Illinois as their candidate. Were the other voters racist? Influenced by racism? Inclined to racism, which they hide even from themselves? Surely all of these factors were at work, but it is virtually impossible with the current research technology to sort them out. Moreover, is the voter a bigot who says &mdash; to himself or others &mdash; &#8221;He&rsquo;s too young for it,&#8221; &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know anything about him,&#8221; &#8220;He&rsquo;s an elitist,&#8221; &#8220;He&rsquo;s just a lot of fancy talk,&#8221; &#8220;The country isn&rsquo;t ready for a man like that,&#8221; &#8220;He&rsquo;s weak in his support of Israel,&#8221; &#8220;He&rsquo;s Muslim, possibly the anti-Christ!&#8221; Are these hints of lurking prejudice? Are the voters of regular members of the Democratic coalition &mdash; Hispanics and union members &mdash; against Obama partly because of racism?</p>
<p>How many of the male readers of this column who are habitues of bars, locker rooms, commuter train bull sessions, pool rooms and men&rsquo;s clubs have not heard the indigenous racial slurs of such environments applied to Obama?</p>
<p>And surely some of the explicit chatter during the campaign was racist, especially the obsession with the various clergy who mounted the pulpit of his church. By what stretch of sick logic could the candidate be responsible for what his clergy said and did?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The point is that racism permeates American society and hides itself under many different disguises. The nomination of an African-American candidate was a near-miracle. Only the innocent and the naive think that the November election will not be about race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Race will silently trump the war, the economy, the cost of gasoline, the disgust with President Bush. One may wish that it will not be so, that if Obama loses it will not be because of the color of his skin but because the country genuinely wants another Republican administration.<br/>

			<p>Disguised racism or not&hellip; only an outright fool would vote for Obama. Give Obama four years, the country would be bankrup monetarily as well as morally, by letting in 20 million Africans, another 30 million Mexicans and another 40 million Pakistanis, Hindus, Chinese and Koreans. All living happily off the American taxpayer. Oh, did I forget REPARATIONS? Obama is all in favor of that angle also. Can&rsquo;t imagine why.</p>

			<p>It seems so wierd to me. Every person I have ever met who wasn&rsquo;t Caucasian is very much for their own race. They chant &#8220;we are the best&#8221; over and over. I have NEVER heard one defend a Caucasian person in any way, shape or form. Even Caucasians put down their own race in defense of people who wouldn&rsquo;t urinate on them if they were on fire. What is WRONG with white America? Why are they ashamed to shout to the stars &#8220;we are builders, dreamers, doers, while so many non whites lurk in the shadows waiting to attach themselves onto what WE have built and done, and we hand it over to them willingly. Have white people gone mad? The time will come when these invaders and leaches have control and then it will be too late. Open your eyes and see, this Obama (if elected) will show white people what blacks who have power are capable of and he will not show sympathy or restraint.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The point is that racism permeates American society and hides itself under many different disguises.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, promoting diversity as a cover for dispossessing European-Americans, or ignoring the astronomical rates of black on white crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only the innocent and the naive think that the November election will not be about race.&#8221;</p>
<p>For blacks that&rsquo;s ALL it will be about.</p>

			<p>&#8216;we&rsquo;re all disgusted with president Bush&rsquo;, and &#8216;I hope if Obama loses it will be because we genuinely want another Republican administration&rsquo;, almost fit into the same sentence. </p>
<p>Are these people trying to embarass themselves, or are they so removed from criticism they end up making themselves look biased and stupid by accident? Personally, I think it&rsquo;s the former but perhaps liberals think that getting away with such bias, and evil?, challenge free, in a brute force kind of way, strengthens their own sick ideology.  </p>

			<p>Is this Andrew Greeley, the Priest and sociologist? If so, where did he learn about bars and locker rooms? If this guy wants to hear racism loud and clear all he need do is listen to bitter Hillary fans, and triumphant Obama partisans. But of course that would mean slaying sacred PC cows  &mdash;  e.g., blacks and feminists.</p>

One of the biggest problems we are faced with today is the unwillingness of the 60s 70s generation (now in power) to stand up to the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; during that shameful episode of our history. </p>
<p>Today, in order to rationalize their cowardice, they profess to not be &#8220;racist&#8221; (whatever that changing political term means). Rather than staying in  denial in order to assuage their guilty consciences, they should just admit they are &#8220;racist&#8221;, (and of course, they are), according to the commonly understood meaning of that term.</p>
<p>Confession is good for the soul. Their doing so might not only earn them the respect of the &#8220;Blacks&#8221;, but the respect of their fellow Whites as well.</p>

Does that meake me prefer one breed  over another? yes.<br/>
Do I like some breeds more than others? yes.<br/>
Do I totally dislike some breeds such as greyhounds? Yes.<br/>
Does that make me a bad person? NO.<br/>
Can you force me to love greyhounds? NO.<br/>

			<p>I&rsquo;d sure like to extend a middle finger to this troublemaker.  Guys like him are already setting the stage for widespread violent reaction in the event that Black Barry loses the election.</p>
<p>As this implicit threat grows more palpable and menacing, I wonder how many whites living in integrated neighborhoods will vote black in hopes of saving their lives and property from the ravages of a discontented black horde?</p>
<p>For the night of the election, taxpayers in every city should insist that their local police be on emegency alert with National Guard units standing by; even if it&rsquo;s just to ensure that the revelry of an Obamacratic victory celebration doesn&rsquo;t get out of hand.  </p>
<p>Pray for peace.          </p>

			<p>Note - &#8220;with the current research technology&#8221; they cannot determine whether someone is not voting for Messiah because of racism.  Certainly in the future, once &#8220;current research technology&#8221; catches-up with ideology, thought crimes can be &#8220;sorted out&#8221; much better.</p>
<p>The query &#8220;By what stretch of sick logic could the candidate be responsible for what his clergy said and did?&#8221; would not be possed if a GOP candidate attended a white supremacist church.  A man declares someone as his mentor, his spiritual father, and to inquire what that man believes and says is racism.  Please.<br/>

			<p>I look at all instutions run by blacks and ask myself if I want to live in a country run by them. The answer is no. If that&rsquo;s racism Andrew Greeley can stew over it all he wants. I really don&rsquo;t care.</p>

			<p>Race will silently trump the religion of leftist progressive fascism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been slowly happening for 10 years or so.  But Obama and his obvious marxist black supremacism is dramatically increasingly this.</p>
<p>If Obama loses, blacks will riot and white racial consciousness will explode.</p>
<p>But if Obama wins, the results of that horrible mistake will cause a reaction not seen in human history for a very long time.</p>

			<p><i>Race will silently trump the war, the economy, the cost of gasoline, the disgust with President Bush.</i></p>
<p>What a perversive article. As if it was not enough that Obama got where he got solely because of his race (should he be white, he would have been crucified already by the MSM and his competitors for his lack of qualifications, empty language, and strongly left-oriented political views).</p>
<p>To add an insult to the injury, now it turns that not voting for this phony candidate would be considered racist. </p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;liberals&#8221; not only distort the truth. They turn it completely upside down.</p>
<p>Speaking of the above quotation from the article, in a sense it describes what&rsquo;s going to happen. The race of the candidate (black) will trump any other consideration, and millions of white preachers of racial non-existence, as well as &#8220;proud&#8221; blacks, will vote for him just because he&rsquo;s black, no matter how they disagree with his political advisors and speechwriters.<br/>

			<p>  People like Andrew Greeley WANT the election to be about race. They can&rsquo;t bear the thought of no longer being able to self-righteously lecture the White majority in this country about &#8220;racism,&#8221; that hobgoblin which they see lurking everywhere, and which is of course practiced only by Whites, never by the darker races.</p>
<p>  What if Obama HAS been the target of some racial slurs in the venues Greeley mentions, supposedly the haunts of good-ole-boy bigots? Does anyone seriously think that in the taverns of Chicago&rsquo;s South Side, in meetings of the NAACP, in many black churches, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, and other White politicians have not been defamed with the other side of the racial bad-word coin?</p>
<p>  It seems to me that White liberals like Greeley are trying to scare and shame White Americans into voting for Obama, lest they be labeled &#8220;racist&#8221; if he loses. Well, I think we can stand such labels, if need be. I&rsquo;ve been called one before, and I didn&rsquo;t lose any sleep over it.</p>

<p>Obama was a member of that church for a long long time.  He certainly was aware of the bigotry coming from the mouth of his pastor - yet he chose to remain a member.  Is it perverse logic to claim that his continued membership speaks to his attitudes?  Furthermore, what if Obama had been white and his pastor gave anti-black speeches? Would Mr. Greeley be so forgiving then?  Obviously not because then Obama would be &#8220;racist&#8221; by association.  This is just more of the same leftist double standards.</p>

			<p>To an extent, what he says is true. Many white people who HATE McCain (count me in) will still vote for him because, well, race trumps politics. </p>
<p>Likewise, some black conservatives will vote Obama for the same reason, as was pointed out in another Amren article.</p>
<p>The veneer is lifting&hellip;.</p>

			<p>There are so many reasons not to vote for Obama it&rsquo;s hard to know where to begin. But for openers, he has no real experience in government, a fact universally acknowledged and well known. He has the most liberal voting record in the senate. This means more government social &#8220;tinkering&#8221; with more tax monies and more interference in the accepted American way of life, the last thing we need. Govenment policies and regulations have already driven our jobs overseas and stopped employers from hiring whomever they pleased. It&rsquo;s obvious Obama is a big brother government guy who will initiate more costly policies at a time when we need far fewer government programs. Government now intrudes into every aspect of our lives and Obama would make things worse. And he is for all but wide open borders and drivers licenses for illegals. A lot of those who think he is something special will lose their jobs and have their taxes increase if he is elected and they are too dumb to see it. The fact he is of mixed race means little to me. Its the policies he will advance that scare the heck out of me. And I&rsquo;m convinced if he is elected all those who think he is so wonderful will come to regret it. Obama means more taxes, more regulation and a loss not only of jobs but a loss of our once great American idenity. All those asolutely ga ga over him had better wake up before its too late. </p>

			<p>  There are many, many reasons that I will not vote for BHO. No experience, he is a democrat, he is an elitist, his policy are dangerous, even more so than McCain or Bush. And yes, I will not vote for obama because he is black and he is tied to far too many radicals. I will not vote for McCain either. I will vote for Ron Paul. If the republicans lose to obama, it is their fault for pushing a loser like mccain when Ron Paul was kept out of the light by republican elitists themselves. McCain is almost as dangerous as obama. I will vote my conscience, and will cast my vote as a patriot to my country by voting for Ron Paul.</p>

			<p>If you believe in change, vote for Barack Obama.  If you believe change can happen then vote for Barack Obama.  If you believe change can change things, then vote for Barack Obama.  If you believe things changing don&rsquo;t stay the same, then vote for Barack Obama.  Change in your pocket is what you will have left if you vote for Barack Obama. A vote for Barack Obama is a vote for the future.  If you believe the future is not here yet, then vote for Barack Obama.  If you believe the future is not the past and the past has already happened, then vote for Barack Obama.  Since the past has already passed, the future needs to be changed, and Barack Obama needs more than your change to do it, so vote for Barack Obama.  In closing, since the future is yet to come, and we need to change it so we don&rsquo;t repeat the past, vote for change now so in the future we can change things, vote for Barack Obama.</p>

<p>No Comrade Greeley, the point is that media Reds like yourself are trying to bully and browbeat whites into voting for this Marxist charlatan, simply because he is black. The fact that he is also a Marxist doesn&rsquo;t hurt, but for you and your kind, the real linchpin that has you hovering between simpering giddiness and hysterical trepidation is that his only selling point is his &ldquo;historic&rdquo; and audaciously hopeful, racial transcendence. Or put another way, your mulatto wunderkind has a campaign that is a mile wide and not even an eight of an inch deep. </p>
<p>If he were white, just what would he have to offer other than windy platitudes, a shady past, and an untested record, all sans the &ldquo;electrifying&rdquo; pigmentation of your obsessions?</p>
<p>The answer is nothing, he would be an utter joke made even more an oddity by your ilk via their endless chatter and odium being directed against him, as opposed to your current state fawning Afro-mania. </p>

<p>The author didn&rsquo;t intend it this way, but this is an excellent example of why democracy fails in multiracial societies.  Unless all the candidates are of the majority race (which alienates the minorities) the whole election winds up being about race, and the important issues of policy, such as the role of the military, the environment, trade policy, labor policy, etc., fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>I am not voting for Obama because he&rsquo;s a socialist and I&rsquo;m not.  He favors illegal immigration, and I don&rsquo;t.  He favors government and corporate policies that discriminate against white people, and I don&rsquo;t.  He thinks our economic problems should be dealt with by having the government spend more money, creating more debt and more inflation.  I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good idea.  So no, I wouldn&rsquo;t vote for Obama if he was white.  I also don&rsquo;t believe him when he acts surprised by the views of his preacher of 20 years.  He just didn&rsquo;t expect them to be found out by the greater public.  Suppose we discovered that McCain had been attending a Christian Identity church for 20 years.  Would anybody believe him if he claimed to not know what their racial positions are?</p>
<p>Suppose Elaine Wright, editor of Issues and Views, ran for president.  Would the liberal media tell us we&rsquo;re racists for not voting for her?  I think not.  They&rsquo;d be smearing her for her paleoconservative views.  (For the record, I&rsquo;d be happy to vote for her, her positions seem very close to Ron Paul&rsquo;s.)</p>

			<p>These kind of articles make me choke from the bad air.   Reminds me of that quote from Neitzsche, about how the Modern Press &ldquo;vomits its Bile and calls it a Newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it also reminds me once again of what happens when the life of the mind and the world of ideas are hijacked by Journalists.  What does the word Journalist in English mean anyway?</p>
<p>It means - Day Laborer.</p>
<p>That is all they are, and you can tell. Laboring daily is honorable, if you are in Construction, Fishing, Farming, or Transport, etc. But when your job is in Information it is only honorable when you do what you are suppoed to do as a Day Laborer of Information, ie; Collect and Distribute Information.</p>
<p>But when you put on airs of being the Guardians of Knowledge and Morality itself, you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that your only intellectual acheivement is in turning all serious thought into trivial cliche. You should also feel damn lucky that Pretentiousness is not a Capital Offence.  Given the fact that their thinking is reduced to the sort of shallowness, slander, and blackmail we find in the above article, is it any wonder most of the country just does not trust the Mainstream Media anymore?</p>
<p>Intellectually shallow and Morally bankrupt they go right on assuming they are right and that we ought to bow in awe and terror before their every word.  It&rsquo;s as if the Press has literally lost its mind, knows it, knows it can&rsquo;t change, and so, is just blowing full steam ahead until it crashes, bringing the rest of us along with them.  Though, of course, the Press are merely the Public Relations Department for the Real Owners of this Country, and of the West – whoever they are.</p>
<p>Well, one thing we know about them.  We KNOW they are not at all Democratic in process or content and have not been for ages and ages.  They know as well as we do that no one should be interested in what they have to say because they don&rsquo;t have our best interests in mind. <br/>
Not only has their cover been blown but the &#8220;principles&#8221; of their &#8220;values&#8221; are also standing exposed in all of their nakedness, and it is not a pretty sight.<br/>
Time to walk away from this bad air and into the sunlight of the spirit, where ever you may find it.  It certainly won&rsquo;t be any near a Newstand.<br/>

			<p> Notice that Greeley doesn&rsquo;t take his point to its obvious conclusion. That being it is the Democratic Party that is &#8220;racist&#8221;. They have played identity politics for decades. There would be a good laugh to be had seeing these Dems caught up in their own machinations if it didn&rsquo;t have such grave consequences for the US.<br/>
 Their core beliefs are Marxist in that they perceive the collective to be of greater value than the individual. Therefore, not voting for ANY woman is sexist or ANY Black is racist. The Clintons, as well as many others in Washington, have publically stated that the individual is unimportant, ie- &#8220;it takes a village&#8221;.<br/>
 Greeley also engages in &#8220;soft bigotry&#8221; by asserting that pointing out the obscene language used &#8220;from the pulpit&#8221; is itself &#8220;obsessive&#8221; and racist. He doesn&rsquo;t hold Blacks to the same standard he holds his ideological opponents. </p>

You are so right! When will all decent people wake up? Will we allow ourselves to be overrun by 13% of the population and their useful idiot enablers? What major event is it going to take for a strong leader to emerge and unite and rescue us all before it is too late. Our Founding Fathers new only too well that democracy is destructive, in the end. You don&rsquo;t need to look any furher but Aristotle&rsquo; Politics.

Well, if the Democrats collectively had gotten over their bizarre racial self-righteousness trips (of which Greely&rsquo;s article is a perfect example) and actually selected an electable candidate, who knows how the election might go?

<p>&gt; This is the essence of the entire issue.  Obama&rsquo;s call to &#8220;get beyond the race issue&#8221; is aimed at whites and no one else.</p>
<p>I argue with liberal whites on other sites sometimes and more so lately.  I get called every curse-word in the book routinely.  I have no doubt that the loss of the election will result in a visible increase in crime, possibly anti-white riots.</p>

			<p>I live on the other side of the world as part of the &#8220;rainbow nation&#8221; of South Africa - another failing African economy.</p>
<p>Will someone please explain to me how the American election process works? We have just witnessed the Hillary/Barak feud in the Democrat camp resulting in the first African American candidate for the Presidency. In November he will be pitched against the Republican McCain to see who will occupy the White House. Am I correct so far?</p>
<p>So what do all the people do whose first choice was Hillary? clearly almost 50% of the Democrat supporters. Do they not vote at all in November, vote for the Democrats anyway or change sides and vote for McCain, or are there other candidates not tied to these two parties??</p>
<p>If these are the choices then assuming an approximate 50-50 split in the country between Republican and Democrats, the &#8220;swing vote&#8221; is in the hands of the Hillary supporters. Their decision is &#8220;Do I stick to my politics and elect an African American as President&#8221; or &#8220;Do I elect a white President and ignore my politics&#8221; or &#8220;Do I waste my vote on a minor candidate just so I can say I voted, and whichever way it goes it wasn&rsquo;t my fault&#8221; or &#8220;Do I just not vote and bury my head in the sand&#8221;???</p>
<p>It seems to me that come November you will not be voting in the best man (woman) for the job - but the lesser of two evils. At least you still have a choice (for now) - in South Africa the black man will win, even if he is openly corrupt, criminal and self serving (just like the rest of Africa)</p>

<p>That is not to say that they won&rsquo;t have power, but it will be short lived.  Since they have no other string in the violin it is easy to dismiss their argument. Since they will never permit that, they will have to depend on force. And when they depend on force they will exhaust their own resources, Economic, Institutional, Bueracratic, etc. <br/>
We will find out soon enough, that they don&rsquo;t know how to run things, which will make it easier to see who IS running them, and then they&rsquo;ll be totally exposed for the incompetent dependents they are, while the one really running the show will no longer be able to hide.  It will be like one of those programs they show you how they work the Special Effects. The mystery will be exposed once and for all – and what was once &ldquo;special&rdquo; will no longer have any effect.<br/>
What will follow next is - World Wide Compassion Fatigue, even among the most hard-headed, except for the usual number of oddballs.<br/>
But also, something else. There is NO reason on earth to expect China and Russia to go along with this -none at all. We will be at our weakest with Obama in the White House. The country is already there.  But putting him in the White House will be putting the cherry on top - after that there will be no doubt, anywhere in the world, that the country once known as the United States of America, is offically over.  Finished.<br/>
It&rsquo;s within the realm of possibility that China and Russia will form a temporary alliance and go in for the kill.  <br/>
But the main point is - it doesn&rsquo;t matter who eventually winds up in the White House.  We are about to hit a bottom that has NO historical precedent.<br/>

O&rsquo;bama&rsquo;s presidency will include pushes for things like reparatioins that hit us all in the wallet and if he loses in the fall the resultant riots will also work in favor of White folks admitting our concious desire to have freedom of association</p>

<p>This was an issue because Obama willingly and wholeheartedly associated with the raving pastor.  Obama was so impressed with the lunatic, racist pastor that he would disown and disparage his own grandmother before he would disown the raving pastor.  It was only after the pastor, in turn, disrespected Obama that he dumped his pastor.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;For the night of the election, taxpayers in every city should insist that their local police be on emegency alert with National Guard units standing by; even if it&rsquo;s just to ensure that the revelry of an Obamacratic victory celebration doesn&rsquo;t get out of hand.&#8221; </p>
<p>Pray for peace. </p>

<p>Karl,<br/>
That night will be another Night of the Long Knives. Count on it!!! Don&rsquo;t count on the National Guard, most of which is deployed to Iraq. Count only on yourselves. Any firearm no matter how small the calibre, is better than nothing. I am sorely afraid that we are going to need them.The cities of this once great country will become one huge Superdome after just as in the days following Katrina.  &#8220;Once more into the breach dear friends.&#8221; </p>

			<p>It seems so wierd to me. Every person I have ever met who wasn&rsquo;t Caucasian is very much for their own race. They chant &ldquo;we are the best&rdquo; over and over. I have NEVER heard one defend a Caucasian person in any way, shape or form. Even Caucasians put down their own race in defense of people who wouldn&rsquo;t urinate on them if they were on fire. What is WRONG with white America? Why are they ashamed to shout to the stars &ldquo;we are builders, dreamers, doers, while so many non whites lurk in the shadows waiting to attach themselves onto what WE have built and done, and we hand it over to them willingly. Have white people gone mad? The time will come when these invaders and leaches have control and then it will be too late. Open your eyes and see, this Obama (if elected) will show white people what blacks who have power are capable of and he will not show sympathy or restraint.</p>
<p>Your wrong brother, I&rsquo;ve stuck up for whites again and again, even against my own race (I&rsquo;m Native American), and believe in the American Flag, so keep walking backwards. </p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a single thing to say about BHO that hasn&rsquo;t already been said. If this is racist, then so be it. A Black president for a majority White nation doesn&rsquo;t make sense for a lot of reasons I won&rsquo;t get into, not the least of which is the unpredictabilty of millions of ignorant and violent Blacks that have proven how dangerous they are before. <br/>
I believe there will be riots if he wins or if he doesn&rsquo;t win. Only more if he doesn&rsquo;t win.<br/>
Can anyone imagine 4 years of DAILY controversial statements by him or his hateful wife?<br/>
I&rsquo;ll cast my vote for McCain, although I dislike most of his thinly veiled liberal policies in hopes that in some way it prevents BHO from winning the presidency.</p>

			<p>As a white person, I am personally offended by this smear.  As an American citizen, I am deeply offended by this cheap, political manipulation.  As a human being, I am offended by this foul-minded- has-been-faux-religious hack&rsquo;s attempt to inflame racial violence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no one cares.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;One of the biggest problems we are faced with today is the unwillingness of the 60s 70s generation (now in power) to stand up to the &#8216;Blacks&rsquo; during that shameful episode of our history&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ronald: </p>
<p>Blacks, especially black criminals and activists, were not only &#8216;not stood up to&rsquo; during that time, they were glorified by the press and foolish leftist elites who funded their murderous causes and considered their associations with them &#8216;chic&rsquo; and &#8216;avant guarde.&rsquo; </p>
<p>David Horowitz, in his fine book Radical Son writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Huey Newton had said&hellip;&rsquo;It was time to pick up the gun.&rsquo; He was an icon of the &rsquo;60s. There is a poster of him in a wicker throne with a shotgun and a spear on every college dorm room in the country. Tom Hayden was calling the Panthers America&rsquo;s Vietcong. STF called them the vanguard of the revolution. You know, Marlon Brando demonstrated for them. Leonard Bernstein, the conductor, raised a lot of money for them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>and&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8221;..I saw that the &#8216;left&rsquo; protects murderers and gangsters. The Panthers killed more than a dozen people&hellip;So anti-white racist has this country become in its liberal culture that black murderers walk free while if you&rsquo;re white&hellip;you could have your career destroyed by a remark that didn&rsquo;t even have malicious intent&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.chuckbaldwinlive.com/horowitz.html</p>
<p>Yes, this is how the 60s and 70s elitists and radicals, the ones who now run our universities, MSM and political and cultural institutions have paralyzed our culture and over-run it with madness.</p>

			<p>You know, it just ocurred to me that Obamas campaign really IS a perfect reflection of Black culture.  <br/>
The campaign&rsquo;s approach to voters is exactly like a mugger&rsquo;s approach to his victims.  Instead of &#8220;Your money or your life&#8221; it&rsquo;s &#8220;Your vote or your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe he is Black enough after all.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Father&#8221; Greeley is an unfortunately prominent figure here in Chicagoland. There&rsquo;s nary a cliche of liberal pseudo-thought you can&rsquo;t find pretty easily in his published musings. It&rsquo;s remarkable how people who pride themselves on virtues like open-mindedness, &#8220;fairness&#8221; and dispassionate inquiry always get around to telling you that when it comes to things like elections there&rsquo;s one and only one thing that intelligent, honest and moral people can do, that no further discussion is necessary, and any objection is really a &#8220;disguise&#8221; for some disagreeable or immoral impulse. By Greeley&rsquo;s logic no one would ever be justified in casting a vote against a black candidate. This is exactly the kind of moral imbecility and autism to which liberalism leads.</p>
<p>Greeley should stick to writing soft-core porn novels (yes, it&rsquo;s true) and leave political analysis to people who can reason from one end of a syllogism to another.</p>

<p><br/>
Thanks, Cassiodorus, for clearing that up for me. When I saw the name Andrew Greeley, I wondered if it was that novelist-priest whose pulpy paperbacks with lurid covers used to compete for rack space with Danielle Steele and Jacqueline Susann back in the &rsquo;70s and &rsquo;80s. I never bought his books, and wasn&rsquo;t aware of the author&rsquo;s ultraliberalism   &mdash;   so when reading the above article, I was guessing that this must be some different (probably black) Greeley. </p>
<p>In any case, this op-ed isn&rsquo;t just dreadful drivel, it&rsquo;s also deeply insulting to whites. It&rsquo;s bad enough we have to listen to &#8220;Only a racist wouldn&rsquo;t vote for Obama&#8221; from blacks   &mdash;   but to also hear it from a combination of Father Pfeger and Jackie Collins is too much to bear. </p>
<p>This bit is especially galling: </p>
<p>&#8220;By what stretch of sick logic could the candidate be responsible for what his clergy said and did?&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
By what stretch of sick logic could a candidate&rsquo;s weekly consumption of venomous black-supremacist ideology at his church for 20 years NOT be relevant to his candidacy? <br/>

			<p>These kind of articles make me choke from the bad air.   Reminds me of that quote from Neitzsche, about how the Modern Press &ldquo;vomits its Bile and calls it a Newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it also reminds me once again of what happens when the life of the mind and the world of ideas are hijacked by Journalists.  What does the word Journalist in English mean anyway?</p>
<p>It means - Day Laborer.</p>
<p>That is all they are, and you can tell. Laboring daily is honorable, if you are in Construction, Fishing, Farming, or Transport, etc. But when your job is in Information it is only honorable when you do what you are suppoed to do as a Day Laborer of Information, ie; Collect and Distribute Information.</p>
<p>But when you put on airs of being the Guardians of Knowledge and Morality itself, you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that your only intellectual acheivement is in turning all serious thought into trivial cliche. You should also feel damn lucky that Pretentiousness is not a Capital Offence.  Given the fact that their thinking is reduced to the sort of shallowness, slander, and blackmail we find in the above article, is it any wonder most of the country just does not trust the Mainstream Media anymore?</p>
<p>Intellectually shallow and Morally bankrupt they go right on assuming they are right and that we ought to bow in awe and terror before their every word.  It&rsquo;s as if the Press has literally lost its mind, knows it, knows it can&rsquo;t change, and so, is just blowing full steam ahead until it crashes, bringing the rest of us along with them.  Though, of course, the Press are merely the Public Relations Department for the Real Owners of this Country, and of the West – whoever they are.</p>
<p>Well, one thing we know about them.  We KNOW they are not at all Democratic in process or content and have not been for ages and ages.  They know as well as we do that no one should be interested in what they have to say because they don&rsquo;t have our best interests in mind. <br/>
Not only has their cover been blown but the &#8220;principles&#8221; of their &#8220;values&#8221; are also standing exposed in all of their nakedness, and it is not a pretty sight.<br/>
Time to walk away from this bad air and into the sunlight of the spirit, where ever you may find it.  It certainly won&rsquo;t be any near a Newstand.<br/>

			<p>I have come to believe that black culture is invasive much like the dreaded southern vine kudzu. If you let it come into your social arena be it pro sports, schools, workplace, it&rsquo;s rules of living become the de facto methodology. For example, the recent champagne spraying NFL player Javon Walker sprayed champagne on black gang members. Their code means you are beat unconcious. That is not the white code but the code of the streets we are forced to deal with. Blacks are so aggressive wherever they are introduced into social arenas they invariably pursue their interests and force their interests upon us.<br/>
I think the reason so many white women sleep with blacks is that black men devote all their waking energies to bedding white women. They will make a pass at every available woman and eventually succeed with some</p>

			<p>The shadow government deliberately presents horrific presidential choices like Obama and Clinton in order to stampede the majority into blindly voting for a red-assed baboon if it were running on the opposing ticket.  John McCain is that red-assed baboon&hellip;<br/>
