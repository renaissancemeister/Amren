<h1>Texas Town Still Shadowed by Dragging Death</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Monica Rhor, AP, June 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ten years after James Byrd Jr. was dragged to death down a three-mile stretch of country road simply because he was black, some things have changed in Jasper.</p>
<p>Black and white teenagers can be seen playing basketball together at James Byrd Jr. Memorial Park. Blacks now make up a majority on the City Council. And an iron fence no longer separates the graves of whites and blacks in the 171-year-old cemetery where Byrd is buried.</p>
<p>But Byrd&rsquo;s murder, which jolted the nation with its utter brutality and unvarnished racism, still casts a shadow over this timber town in deep East Texas. And many folks here think it always will.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ever since three white men beat the 49-year-old Byrd, chained him by the ankles to the bumper of a Ford pickup truck, then pulled him down Huff Creek Road in the early hours of June 7, 1998, Jasper has been almost synonymous with the horrors of racism.</p>
<p>Byrd&rsquo;s remains were found scattered in 75 places along the twisting path that cuts through a pine forest. His head and right arm were discovered about a mile from his mangled torso.</p>
<p>A decade later, according to Diggles, some people are still afraid to visit Jasper, a town of 8,000 where the main intersection is a cluster of fast-food places and restaurants offering chicken fried steak specials. Some businesses have been reluctant to come to town, which is badly in need of industry.</p>
<p>However, Diggles and many others say there is a hopeful part of the story too often overlooked: The murder forced the people of Jasper, a town whose population is almost evenly divided between black and white, to confront their prejudices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Byrd&rsquo;s murderers were quickly arrested and convicted, offering some comfort that justice was served. John William King and Lawrence Russell Brewer are now on death row. Shawn Allen Berry is serving a life sentence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After Byrd&rsquo;s death, the family created the James Byrd Jr. Foundation for Racial Healing, which conducts diversity workshops, awards scholarships to minorities and helped win passage of a hate crime bill in Texas. The foundation also runs an oral history project on racism; more than 2,600 people have described their experiences.</p>
<p>Foshage and other townspeople said that before the killing, blacks and whites sat separately at football games and in other public settings. But now, they say, they see less of that, with blacks and whites mingling more, and they attribute that to the Byrd family&rsquo;s efforts to fight bigotry.</p>
<p>Similarly, townspeople are attributing the black majority on the City Council to changed attitudes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Saturday, as they have every year on the anniversary of Byrd&rsquo;s death, the Byrds will hold a service &mdash; not just as a memorial, but also as a challenge to those still shackled by prejudice.</p>

			<p>This reminds me of what has recently happened in Knoxville,TN over the murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom.</p>
<p>First, a veritable army of Black clergymen called on Blacks to repent of their race hatred, defend the innocent (regardless of race) and to demand severe penalties for the criminal murderers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if we have our own Black societal standards and prefer the companionship of our own kind,&#8221; said Rev. Joseph Randolf, &#8220;we must still stand for righteousness, without regard for race. These brutes must be punished. I call upon you all in the name of Dr. King to demand justice!&#8221; </p>
<p>Next, news media were scolded by their owners and boards of directors for playing up the sufferings of Blacks, while virtually ignoring the sufferings of Whites. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is obvious to anyone that a certain bias has taken place in the media&rsquo;s reporting, based solely on the amount of coverage, or lack thereof, that they give to certain stories in the past thirty or forty years or so.&#8221; said Dr. Curtis Silver, professor of journalism at University of Tennesseee, Knoxville. &#8220;The Christian-Newsom case is a sterling example.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even bluesman Rufus Jones said, &#8220;The White folks done bent over backwards to help us. The Whites today are good people. They had nothin&rsquo; to do with slavery. I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; I love &#8216;em, but I  respect &#8216;em. If Black folks can&rsquo;t stand on their own now, they ain&rsquo;t never gonna. White folks need to start treatin&rsquo; Black folks like adults, and stop worryin&rsquo; &#8216;bout it. If somethin&rsquo;s wrong for Whites, it&rsquo;s  wrong for Blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>(All the above  &mdash;  every word of it  &mdash;   is a total, insane fabrication from a demented mind, completely out-of-touch with reality.) <br>

			<p>James Byrd had been in prison seven times.  I&rsquo;m perfectly happy that his killers are put away, but let&rsquo;s not pretend that this is anything more than a trash-on-trash murder.  It&rsquo;s not an occasion for any commemoration, other than the families and friends.  If this is all that the MSM can come up with for a White racist atrocity, we have a lots more to hold against Blacks than they do against us.  </p>

			<p>Personally I think if they are going to keep dredging up 10 year old white on black crimes to use to &#8220;prove&#8221; how racist and violent whites are we need to start showing up with signs and posters that depict black on white crimes.  Instead of doing it for the 10 year period in question we could do if for like the past 10 days.  I am sure we could come up with hundreds of rapes, murders and violent assaults.  Time to shut these stupid white guilt agitators up.</p>

			<p>I have a half brother who was in prison when they brought the accused into the prison system.He also lived in Jasper as I have before also. After only a couple of days several blacks beat him so severe he had to stay in intensive care for two months, to steal his shoes they claimed. He was also beat and gang raped by a group of blacks only a few weeks after getting out of the prison hospital. He had also heard that Bird raped and beat white prisoners while he did time. This is part of the story you will never here in our anti-white controlled media!</p>

			<p>I do wish they would tell this story in the proper context.</p>
<p>All of the guys involved in this incident were not just local citizen but were all a bunch of Ex-cons. It&rsquo;s not Jasper Texas that should be held responsible for this it&rsquo;s the prison system.</p>
<p>No mention of bla<br>

<p>P.S., the ringleader of the crime became a racist in prison, after being brutally raped by blacks.  Don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting for that to show up in the press.</p>

			<p>Three sick individuals do a horrendous thing and every white in the state is branded racist.  When are they going to address black bigotry?  It&rsquo;s out there and it&rsquo;s bad.  What about the white guy that was dragged to death by blacks in Texas after James Byrd?  What about 6-year old Jake Robel who was dragged five miles by an indifferent black criminal?  Pieces of this child&rsquo;s body was found in more than 75 places.  The problem is most whites buy into this &#8220;I am evil&#8221; mantra and are totally ignorant of the enormity of black crime and racism.<br>

<p>What will it take to make them feel safe? Will they feel safe when they&rsquo;re the majority or when all the whites are gone?</p>

			<p>This dragging of 10 years ago is nothing compared to what Whites have suffered at the hands of murdering black thugs. When and where are the memorial services for Melissa McLaughlin, Eve Carson, Adrian Hall, Stacy Bagley, Brandy Duval, Laura Burk, Patricia Stansfield (dragged to death by a black carjacker)and the 37,453 other white women who were victimized by blacks in a one year period in this country? Why aren&rsquo;t their names making it into the media year after year. This figure doesn&rsquo;t include the amount of White male victims such as Daniel Cicciaro, Michael Carter, Todd Bagley, Gregory Griffith, Michael Scott, Richard Skelton, Gary Traska, Donald Lange, George Sullivan, Joe Rowan and Jake Robel (also dragged to death by a black carjacker). Don&rsquo;t forget the White children such as Tiffany Long (age 10)and Devon Duniver(age 5). All of these White folks were killed simply for being White. Furthermore, all of these Whites were victims in just the last several years. I could add thousands of other names of White victims if time and space allowed. The Town of Jasper is obviously managed by a bunch of black/&#8221;minority&#8221; idiots and any White townpeople are obviously even more stupid for letting these one-sided attitudes prevail.</p>

			<p>This is from an article on the website &#8220;Stop Prison Rape&#8221;. It tells a bit we don&rsquo;t hear about in the news:</p>
<p>When King arrived at the prison, a group of white supremacists reportedly conspired with the guards to place King in the &#8220;black&#8221; section of the prison. At just 140 pounds, King was unable to defend himself against a group of black prisoners who repeatedly gang-raped him. This was exactly what the white power gang wanted. Filled with hatred, King was easily recruited into their group for protection. Over the remainder of his sentence, they filled King&rsquo;s head full of hatred for blacks. When he was released, John King unleashed that pent-up hatred on James Byrd. The gang-rapes he endured in prison are no excuse for his murder of James Byrd, but they certainly help us understand what could lead him to hate so much.<br>

			<p>How interesting that this 10 year old story continues to receive media attention from the likes of The Associated Press, in all its gory, inflammatory detail.  Body torn into 75 pieces?  The head and right arm found a mile from his mangled torso?  Wow!  Hows that for descriptive?<br>
When the Knoxville crime occurred in January, 2007, wasn&rsquo;t the subsequent universal silence by the MSM and the left excused away by claims that THOSE details were too inflammatory for public consumption?  Yet here we are 10 years after James Byrd was murdered, and only 1 1/2 years after Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom were murdered, and the details of the James Byrd murder continues to get media attention while Channon and Christopher remain an afterthought.<br>
After reading this latest piece by the AP on James Byrd, it looks like the excuse that &#8220;Knoxville was just too gory to mention&#8221; turns out to be a lie.  Are any of us surprised?</p>

			<p> As with all liberal and minority causes, enough is never enough. His image was used in political ads to show how racist America put Bush in the White House over Gore. Everytime the minority and/or liberals want their way, they will point to the institutional racism that killed this &#8220;wonderful&#8221; black man. Enough will never be enough, whites must grovel and beg forgiveness at the altar of racist blacks and self-hating liberals. In their eyes, we must, as a people be destroyed. Nothing less will satisfy their lust.</p>

			<p>What does racial healing mean anyway? I think we know what that means. Let&rsquo;s get Whites to feel guilty about their evil ways. Many of those evil ways are basically here on American Renaissance. They are very afraid of the views we advocate here. So they want to amalgamate the races so Whites can just become a minority without any racial consciousness.</p>

<p>OK: do either of you two have verifiable sources for the record of James Byrd? It would help, to cite them. I am glad his killers will fry-the sooner the better-how about yesterday? <br>
But this nation needs to get the whole story&hellip;which the MSM never gives. And about the Knoxville horror&hellip;is it true, or not that the white couple was out slumming? looking for coke or meth? I&rsquo;m just sayin&hellip;the things you do, the company you keep; they make a BIG difference in how you live &hellip;and die. Bad folks, or folks doing stupid stuff are a lot more likely to meet with an unfortunate-or horrific end. </p>

At just 140 pounds, King was unable to defend himself against a group of black prisoners who repeatedly gang-raped him.&#8221;</p>
<p>         Are you saying that King would have been safer among the white prisoners, and that blacks commit more prison rapes? I really can&rsquo;t see prison guards conspiring with &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; to turn this man against blacks  &mdash;  experience alone usually does that.  </p>

			<p>Why should anyone confront their prejudices?  Who decided that my not liking blacks needs to be confronted?  I do not like blacks because of they way they act and think. I am sick of their constant whining, complaining, freeloading, violence and the overall refusal of their race to mature and act civilized. If any group needed to confront something, it is them. Confront the fact that most white sur-names never owned a slave. They worked their farms and ranches themselves. And not one black living today has ever been a slave!  Its not a black thing, its a stupid thing- get over it!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ten years after James Byrd Jr. was dragged to death down a three-mile stretch of country road simply because he was black, some things have changed in Jasper.</p>
<p>Black and white teenagers can be seen playing basketball together at James Byrd Jr. Memorial Park. Blacks now make up a majority on the City Council. And an iron fence no longer separates the graves of whites and blacks in the 171-year-old cemetery where Byrd is buried.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please spare me the blather about the &#8220;small racist southern town.&#8221; Blacks and whites in small southern towns like this have always played basketball, talked together whatever. Life in these towns are boring with anything racial rarely happening. Everyone knows everyone and life moves along. If the cemetary fence were a problem, blacks would have taken it down years ago. Bottom line, when something happens like this in NY City, nobody blames the whole city but let it happen in a small town and everyone is to blame. Anyways, black on white crime far outnumbers the reverse.</p>

			<p>So you&rsquo;re a racist until you give up power?  Wow!  But of course only whites are stupid enough to give up power and our civilization.  Can yo imagine the Nazis telling the Jews that &#8220;you&rsquo;re racist and anti-German if you don&rsquo;t let us kill you and take your possessions&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Like the first 12 seconds of the Rodney King beating tape, there are issues in the Byrd dragging that were mentioned within a few hours of the crime and then completely dropped from any reports thereafter.</p>
<p>These guys didn&rsquo;t just Byrd randomly and decide to drag him down that road.  And I&rsquo;m not condoning what they did.  It was stupid.  But I remember a report just after it happened that said that one of the guys spend time in jail with Byrd and that the dragging was revenge.</p>
<p>Has any newspaper printed a story about the girl that survived the Kansas massacre by the Carr brothers?  How is she doing?  Does anybody in the media care about her?  No.  If she were black, we&rsquo;d still be hearing about it.</p>

			<p>It continues to amaze me how the media cooperates in the creation of anti-white symbols while all the while ignoring the reality of massive black on white crime in America.  One would almost be forced to conclude that they had the specific goal of constantly stroking the flames of white guilt at the same time that whites are overwhelmingly the victims of inter-racial crime.  How does one turn off the MSM?  How does one get the truth in front of the public?  Apparently to object to black on white violence makes one a white racist.  That we have come to this in such a short time is a testament to the success of the &#8220;march through the institutions&#8221;.<br>
Multiculturalism and multiracialism have failed miserably.  It is well past time for whites to establish a home of their own, an ethnostate.  If it is valid for every other race to maintain its identity, then it is valid for whites to do the same.</p>

			<p>(sarcasm) Yes, it&rsquo;s Whites in the South in small town America we should look out for. They are the racist, ignorant, backward and dangerous ones.  </p>
<p>This one story is used as a complete reversal of the reality of hate crimes, and of America in general.</p>
<p>I like how this, 10 years after story, has a reverasal of the reversal. It&rsquo;s the blacks in this story who say they&rsquo;ve forgiven the whites. What will they think up next to scare people?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to believe those who say hate crime laws etc are just efforts to put poor whites in prison. I guess it depends on who you are. </p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s really wrong and a crime to incite racial hatred, what the hell have I been watching on my TV the last 20 years?!</p>

			<p>The Byrd family inadvertantly found a way to stage a day of guilt for all the remaining whites in Jasper.  I don&rsquo;t know, but I would guess that the white population of Jasper has been diminishing in the past ten years.  I can imagine that eventually there will be a national &#8220;Slavery Rememberance Day&#8221; for the purpose of perpetuating white guilt and the continued reversal of roles and wealth, supplemented by immigration of non-whites until the &#8220;final solution&#8221; of the race problem in the U.S. has been concluded.</p>

<p>excellent post.  It is our responsibility to make the world aware of what is going on.  Let&rsquo;s face it:  many people buy hook, line and sinker whatever nonsense the MSM feeds them.  People are more concerned about who wins &#8220;American Idol&#8221; than what is going on in their backyard.</p>
<p>We owe it to our friends and family to email these types of stories, encourage reading the news provided by AMREN, VDARE, News With Views, etc.  The vast majority of ordinary joe white folks haven&rsquo;t a clue and we owe it to them to tell them the truth of what is happening in this country.</p>
<p>If we are to believe we even have a chance to turn things around, we must first get the word out.  </p>

			<p>For the life of me, I don&rsquo;t understand WHY the media will go through such lengths to cover up Black on White hate crimes will going into a feeding frenzy over the incredibly rare White on Black hate crime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a conspiracy of silence by the media. That the media is controlled is inarguable. The media being the same tool as our Hollywood Propaganda Machine to try to mold and form what we common Americans think, believe. Remember how the media quickly bought into the official 911 Version, then carefully purged contradictory stories and information from its archives   &mdash;   stories that might have conflicted with or raised doubts about the Official Story.</p>
<p>Both print and electronic media are tools used to control what American citizens learn and think. The political hacks WANT us to be human sheep, unquestioningly swallowing anything we&rsquo;re told. Including the myth Blacks are no different than Whites, other than by pigmentation. Portraying Whites as evil, foul-hearted racists while ignoring the Niagara volume of Black on White hate crimes of every description   &mdash;   from children mugged by gangs of Blacks in the schools, to the rapes, attacks of White women by Blacks, who if caught, blame it as getting back at us for slavery or similar nonsense. Gangs of New York Blacks attacking White joggers in Central Park. On subways and buses. While the media does its best to ignore the trend.</p>

			<p>Same old,same old. Interracial crime is almost always black on white in the US but in the rare case that a white does something to a black, it is on the news for years and years, whereas a black on white crime, no matter how brutal, is totally ignored.</p>

			<p>As I recall, the black man in question was dragged to death because of a possible drug deal gone bad.  The media of course blew the whole thing up into a racial issue.  This was a bunch of violent ex-cons metering out their form of justice.</p>
<p>And yes, the whites had gone through hell by the heinous acts perpetrated upon them by blacks.  But this case revolved more around felon justice and ex-criminals meting out punishment for  being cheated, not just because the victim was black.</p>
<p>The media sure knows how to report events in order to stimulate blacks into their usual outbursts and once again prove how &#8220;bad&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; whitey is.  </p>

			<p> The truth about Byrd&rsquo;s murderer being repeatedly raped by black inmates was in World Magazine . It did happen, it&rsquo;s no myth . I don&rsquo;t know what the kid was in for (was his name King ?) but shouldn&rsquo;t he be able to pay his debt to society without this abuse ? Also not long after Byrd&rsquo;s murder, blacks in Jasper more or less kidnapped a white simpleton, Ken &#8220;Bimbo &#8221; Tillery, beat him senseless and then dragged him to death beneath the chassis of their car in near identical fashion to Byrd&rsquo;s murder  . You&rsquo;d have to be simple yourself not to realize it was in retribution, but the media and the law have worked overtime to sweep it under the rug .</p>

			<p>If Whites were as bad as Blacks say we are, why do they have to go to our schools and live amongst us?  If Blacks were given the best state-of-the-art school with the best teachers and Whites were put in the worst school in town, the blacks would start complaining that their school was inferior to the White&rsquo;s school because of the more civilized, better-performing atmosphere of the White school.  They forgot that what makes a school good is the lack of Blacks to attend it.  Demographics is everything&hellip;.</p>

			<p>I have just skimmed through most of these posts - and I sense this continual victimization of white folks mentality. Get a grip, white supremacy has overcome your minds and be very careful, because the world is tipping toward the other direction. Out with white supremacy and in with equality. </p>
