<h1><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0208/8642.html">Michelle Obama Thesis Was on Racial Divide</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeffrey Ressner, Politico, February 22, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Michelle Obama&rsquo;s senior year thesis at Princeton University, obtained from the campaign by Politico, shows a document written by a young woman grappling with a society in which a black Princeton alumnus might only be allowed to remain &#8220;on the periphery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My experiences at Princeton have made me far more aware of my &lsquo;blackness&rsquo; than ever before,&#8221; the future Mrs. Obama wrote in her thesis introduction. &#8220;I have found that at Princeton, no matter how liberal and open-minded some of my white professors and classmates try to be toward me, I sometimes feel like a visitor on campus; as if I really don&rsquo;t belong. Regardless of the circumstances underwhich I interact with whites at Princeton, it often seems as if, to them, I will always be black first and a student second.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thesis, titled &#8220;Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community&#8221; and written under her maiden name, Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, in 1985, has been the subject of much conjecture on the blogosphere and elsewhere in recent weeks, as it has been &#8220;temporarily withdrawn&#8221; from Princeton&rsquo;s library until after this year&rsquo;s presidential election in November. Some of the material has been written about previously, however, including a story last year in the Newark Star Ledger.</p>
<p>Obama writes that the path she chose by attending Princeton would likely lead to her &#8220;further integration and/or assimilation into a white cultural and social structure that will only allow me to remain on the periphery of society; never becoming a full participant.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Attempts to retrieve the document through Princeton proved unsuccessful, with school librarians having been pestered so much for access to the thesis that they have resorted to reading from a script when callers inquire about it. Media officers at the prestigious university were similarly unhelpful, claiming it is &#8220;not unusual&#8221; for a thesis to be restricted and refusing to discuss &#8220;the academic work of alumni.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Obama campaign, however, quickly responded to a request for the thesis by Politico. The thesis offers several fascinating insights into the mind of Michelle Obama, who has been a passionate advocate of her husband&rsquo;s presidential aspirations and who has made several controvesial statements, including this week&rsquo;s remark, &#8220;For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country.&#8221; That comment has fueled debate on countless blogs, radio talk shows and cable news for days on end, causing her to explain the statement in greater detail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In defining the concept of identification or the ability to identify with the black community,&#8221; the Princeton student wrote, &#8220;I based my definition on the premise that there is a distinctive black culture very different from white culture.&#8221; Other thesis statements specifically pointed to what was seen by the future Mrs. Obama as racially insensitive practices in a university system populated with mostly Caucasian educators and students: &#8220;Predominately white universities like Princeton are socially and academically designed to cater to the needs of the white students comprising the bulk of their enrollments.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most germane subjects approached in the thesis is a section in which she conveyed views about political relations between black and white communities. She quotes the work of sociologists James Conyers and Walter Wallace, who discussed &#8220;integration of black official(s) into various aspects of politics&#8221; and notes &#8220;problems which face these black officials who must persuade the white community that they are above issues of race and that they are representing all people and not just black people,&#8221; as opposed to creating &#8220;two separate social structures.&#8221;</p>

			<p>That thesis isnt worth reading. Steve Sailer has gone over it extensively.</p>
<p>Michelle is nothing but a permanent affirmative action junkie with an average IQ who has spent her life feeling rejected in elite institutions because she wasnt smart enough.</p>
<p>Smart Blacks like Thomas Sowell who can actually compete dont yammer about Social Justice.</p>

			<p>Again, the whites and I suppose others as well, who vote for the clearly racist Obama&rsquo;s, are stupid, clueless, brainwashed, or all of them. </p>

&#8220;[T]here is a distinctive black culture very different from white culture.&rdquo; </p>
<p><br>
So there is, Michelle. And so now, having admitted it yourself, you should not be surprised if most of us whites do not want a representative of that &#8220;very different culture&#8221; ruling over us and making important political and cultural decisions on our behalf. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re simply too different for such an arrangement to be workable. You yourself have implied as much. </p>
<p>And to take your thesis one step further, Michelle, if the two cultures are indeed as very different as you claim, then maybe the logical conclusion of your assertion should not be &#8220;Therefore you should vote for my wonderful hubby,&#8221; but rather, &#8220;Therefore blacks and whites should try to negotiate a mutually agreeable separation of the races.&#8221; </p>
<p>If Homebama were running on THAT platform, I might even consider giving him my vote. <br>

			<p>I read the whole thing; it was painful as the prose was horrible, the pseudo-scientific nature of the &#8220;study&#8221; based on a survey is obvious; there are data tables without any statistical analysis(not even mean+/-SD) and a few curious arrow diagrams; a total of 8 references for the whole &#8220;thesis&#8221;; for some reason the terms black/s and white/s are always capitalized.  The whole thing might be acceptable for a high school term paper, certainly not acceptable for anything written as such for a university; I would guess that her IQ, purely based on this paper, is somewhere around 90, i.e. slightly above the black US norm of 85.  She does not omit to mention how racist Princeton is and what a poor victim she is as a black in an evil white society.<br>
We are likely to have as our first lady a woman of below average intelligence with a huge racial chip on her shoulder.  Perfect.</p>

			<p>How can Michelle Obama be objective in her thesis when her mind is so biased.In case you wonder who the respondents are (A.B.P.A.).The Association of Black Princeton Alumni are the people quizzed .They felt so much apart of Princeton that they had to form a separate pro-black group.Another subjective and biased view .How can any of these writings have any credibility.These educated black people are totally unaware of their own black identity that is engrained in their make up and reinforced by society.                </p>

			<p>Obama and his wife are black supremacists.  More and more evidence has turned up over time, of this.  Much more will come out.  More importantly, this info will become much more widely known.</p>
<p>The only question is how widely known it will become that blacks almost universally support black supremacism.  To the point of advocating genocide against whites:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phjGdHVp1Lo" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phjGdHVp1Lo</a></p>
<p>Jeremiah Wright was advocating the EXACT same thing with his emphasis on &#8220;liberation theology&#8221; defined by James Hal Cone.  Almost certainly, Obama secretly has that as his ultimate goal.</p>
<p>This has implications FAR beyond this election and democracy in general.  Blacks have been waging low level race war for decades now.  Authors like Paul Sheehan, estimate the number of white victims of this completely unprovoked and unreturned aggression in the tens of millions.</p>
<p>My point is that blacks show every sign of vastly ramping up this violence and perhaps transitioning into an overt, organized war to overthrow our government.  Black supremacy isn&rsquo;t an intellectual construct but a plan they mean to implement.</p>
<p>They will fail, of course.  They simply don&rsquo;t have anywhere near the numbers or intellectual capacity to succeed.  But, any whites unaware of this and who live near even minor concentrations of blacks, risk the deaths of themselves and their families.</p>
<p>To prevent that, whites who know better, MUST move away from blacks, arm themselves and organize.  Living in a state with laws that allow true self-defense and carrying a firearm at all times will become a fact of life for most of us.</p>

<p>This seems pretty delusional, because her solution of course will be to get in greater touch with her blackness. </p>

<p>This statement displays an obvious mental illness in the way of an inferiority complex. Its also displays the average opinion of blacks in America. Therefore it is a waste of time to attempt any type of racial reconciliation. Therfore there is no other option but sepearation.</p>

			<p>All racist views of hers aside, the syntax, grammar, and overall composition of the thesis are poor.  </p>
<p>She HAD to be an affirmative action enrollee.  And, of course, Princeton and every other college will make sure these &#8216;students&rsquo; graduate no matter how poorly they perform in class.  </p>

			<p><i>Media officers at the prestigious university were similarly unhelpful, claiming it is &ldquo;not unusual&rdquo; for a thesis to be restricted and refusing to discuss &ldquo;the academic work of alumni.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Just how usual is it for a university to restrict access to a senior thesis?</p>
<p><i>Read the full thesis here: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4</i></p>
<p>Princeton University: 0    Internet: 1</p>
<p>Well I skimmed through the thing and there&rsquo;s nothing I regard as shocking.  It&rsquo;s pretty typical racial sociology.  Of course if a white person wrote the thesis and &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; were reversed everywhere it would destroy the career of the hapless author.  Imagine a thesis by a white person saying:</p>
<p><i>Earlier in my college career, there was no doubt in my mind that as a member of the White community I was somehow obligated to this community and would utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit this community first and foremost.  My experiences at Princeton have made me far more aware of my &#8220;Whiteness&#8221; than ever before.</i></p>
<p>I myself see nothing wrong with a white person having such views, but that is precisely what makes us Ameren readers pariahs in the eyes of our &#8220;betters&#8221;.<br>

One thing we learn about Michelle Obama  &mdash;   after four years at an Ivy League university, she still couldn&rsquo;t write. </p>
<p>Her admittance to Harvard Law School looks pretty clearly to have been the result of affirmative action. No white candidate producing this level of writing (high school level at best) would be admitted. </p>
<p>P.S. Hey Amren, this came out in February. Was this a slow week?</p>

			<p>She spends 4 years at Princeton studying how to get educated blacks to feel more all important solidarity toward underclass ones (even as her actions serve to separate her from them). Writes an entire thesis on, surprise, blacks, with the help of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni (She seems as if she believes she will be graded on the number of times she can write the word black in her thesis). She quotes Stokely Carmichael, reasoning behind black separationists, the Organization of Black Unity, Princeton University Black Thoughts table, and the Society of Black Engineers. Then she worries about being seen as black first, by ignorant whites. Those darn racists. </p>

			<p>If that&rsquo;s what passes for a senior thesis at an Ivy League school, I think I have an excellent chance of not only getting in, but graduating Magna Cum Laude!</p>
<p>Personally, I wish whites could have their own schools again. Imagine being able to go to a &#8220;historically white&#8221; university!</p>

<p>   -She&rsquo;s right. She really didn&rsquo;t belong there. Princeton was originally founded as an all White, all male institution if I am not mistaken, so no actually she never really did belong there.</p>

			<p>This woman, her husband, and their friends, spent over 20 yrs. attending a &#8220;church&#8221; whose pastor spewed every kind of vile racist lie he could conjure, she already harbored those same Marxist and racist beleifs, well documented in her thesis, and now she wants people to vote for her husband for pres., not in my world.</p>

<p>Imagine if a white candidate&rsquo;s wife wrote this about Howard or Grambling?</p>
<p>Anyhoo, I keep hearing rumors of a tape with Barack&rsquo;s better half railing against whitey from the pulpit of their black identity church.</p>
<p>Not sure if such a tape exists but I am 100% sure that she   &mdash;   and probably her potato-headed husband   &mdash;  have made such statements.<br>

<p>She certain was  &mdash;  Newsweek had the &#8216;audacity&rsquo; to print this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; but she was not at the top of her class. She didn&rsquo;t get the attention of the school&rsquo;s college counselors, who helped the brightest students find spots at prestigious universities. &hellip; Some of her teachers told her she didn&rsquo;t have the grades or test scores to make it to the Ivies.

			<p>Ms. Obama goes on about the fact only 10% of the Princeton student body is black because of the shameful legacy of discrimination. But being blacks made up around 12% of the population in 1986, and that there are around 100 Historically black colleges in the US, and a greater number of Majority black colleges, doesn&rsquo;t that make them overrepresented at Princeton? You can&rsquo;t have hundreds of colleges in the US filled up with black students and then expect the remaining ones to have vital diversity, or whatever word they are using now. If you have both at the same time, they would obviously be overrepresented, as they already are at hundreds of colleges across the US. That&rsquo;s if you believe in these efforts in the first place. I don&rsquo;t. Nevertheless administrators, down to lowly assistant profs, work tirelessly to increase any overrepresentation. These group based efforts, trouncing on individual rights, can be described as nothing other than base naked racism.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be enthusiastic about these well-meaning efforts. As someone who has been ceasslessly discriminated against by women and non-whites at every possible opportunity for 44 years, I can&rsquo;t be enthusiastic about private companies and the government jumping on this bandwagon too. That would just be dumb. </p>

			<p>Michelle Obama&rsquo;s senior year thesis at Princeton University, obtained from the campaign by Politico, shows a document written by a young woman grappling with a society in which a black Princeton alumnus might only be allowed to remain &ldquo;on the periphery.&rdquo;&hellip;My experiences at Princeton have made me far more aware of my &lsquo;blackness&rsquo; than ever before,&rdquo;  &ldquo;I have found that at Princeton, no matter how liberal and open-minded some of my white professors and classmates try to be toward me, I sometimes feel like a visitor on campus; as if I really don&rsquo;t belong. Regardless of the circumstances underwhich I interact with whites at Princeton, it often seems as if, to them, I will always be black first and a student second.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how the BLACKS are ALWAYS reading something SINISTER in WHITES!&hellip;they are ALWAYS looking for RACISM where none exists!&hellip;as far as BLACKS are concerned&hellip;WHITES are DAMNED if we DO and DAMNED if we DON&rsquo;T!&hellip;THEY make their PRISONS by living in the PAST and NOT LETTING GO OF IT!&hellip;what she attributes to the attitude of whites is, in fact, HER attitude&hellip;SHE is BLACK FIRST and a student second!&hellip;and MAYBE&hellip;just MAYBE&hellip;the other students and professors treated her as just what she was&hellip;an AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RECIPIENT who had NO BUSINESS being there!</p>
<p>As it has been &ldquo;temporarily withdrawn&rdquo; from Princeton&rsquo;s library until after this year&rsquo;s presidential election in November&hellip;</p>
<p>And therein lies the PROBLEM&hellip;the press has TOTALLY IGNORED the TRUTH about OBAMA and his wife!&hellip;they&rsquo;ve COVERED UP, MISCONSTRUED, IGNORED and DISTORTED the FACTS about this couple!&hellip;a total WHITEWASH and COVERUP is being perpetrated!</p>
<p>Will only allow me to remain on the periphery of society; never becoming a full participant.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>She CHOSE&hellip;as most BLACKS do&hellip;to remain &#8220;on the periphery&#8221;&hellip;never becoming a full participant!&hellip;they have set their limitations THEMSELVES!</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;I based my definition on the premise that there is a distinctive black culture very different from white culture.&rdquo;&hellip;&ldquo;Predominately white universities like Princeton are socially and academically designed to cater to the needs of the white students comprising the bulk of their enrollments.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>MOST colleges and universities are like that&hellip;including BLACK colleges and universities!&hellip;just like any other BUSINESS&hellip;they cater to those that SUPPORT them financially!&hellip;but, instead of WHINING&hellip;why didn&rsquo;t she leave and attend ANOTHER college?</p>
<p>She quotes the work of sociologists James Conyers and Walter Wallace, who discussed &ldquo;integration of black official(s) into various aspects of politics&rdquo; and notes &ldquo;problems which face these black officials who must persuade the white community that they are above issues of race and that they are representing all people and not just black people,&rdquo; as opposed to creating &ldquo;two separate social structures.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>I think we all know that THAT is NOT true&hellip;BLACKS are ALLOWED to be representative of BLACKS&hellip;it&rsquo;s the WHITES who have to prove that they represent ALL people&hellip;not just WHITES!&hellip;BLACKS are given a free pass to be as RACIST and RACE-ORIENTED and FOCUSED as they choose!</p>

			<p>Reader 1, John and others have anticipated my reaction. Mrs. Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;thesis&#8221; is comprised of sloppy, mawkish, inept prose marshalled in defense of an essentially indefensible position. It&rsquo;s also worth pointing out the tendency among black scholars and &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; to write mostly about themselves and secondly about other blacks, to the virtual exclusion of anything else (yes, there are exceptions, but they&rsquo;re quite exceptional). Blacks are rewarded with doctorates from good universities for writing about themselves or their families, and calling it &#8220;history.&#8221; Nice work if you can get it, and you can get it, if you&rsquo;re black.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been out of grad school for about 10 years now but I think I remember reading somewhere that the word &#8220;I&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t belong in a scholarly research paper, which is what a senior thesis is supposed to be. Like others have pointed out, this seems like a typical high school essay. It is simply astonishing that this was an acceptable senior thesis at Princeton. I would like to compare it to a randomly selected white student&rsquo;s senior thesis.</p>

			<p>If whites are deferential and kind towards blacks they complain we&rsquo;re being condescending.  If we treat them like everyone else we&rsquo;re racist.  We simply cannot win and are always assumed guilty when interacting with blacks.  </p>
<p>Most blacks simply don&rsquo;t feel comfortable around white people even when we treat them with the utmost respect.  Similarly, most of us don&rsquo;t feel comfortable around them although their propensity for violent and unpredictable behavior is the main reason.  </p>
<p>The thoughts expressed by Michelle Obama prove that forced integration is a source of discord, is driving the races further apart and perhaps towards open conflict.  It has utterly failed.  I just hope the course can be reversed before this insane experiment destroys our race and future.</p>

<p>Naturally you draw exactly the wrong conclusion. The fact is that blacks at places like Princeton are not held to the same standards as other students, and in fact to all intents and purposes could be attending a separate institution, one consubstantial with the traditional university but with a completely different set of courses, instructors, standards, etc. You really do not understand how American universities work.<br>

This woman, based on her work, should never have been admitted in the first place.  Who ever thought that Princeton University would dumb itself down for minorities?  Just as they have reduced our greatest cities to hellholes, our Universities have been trashed intellectually by letting in those who never qualified in the first place.</p>
<p>Saddest of all, to me Princeton University is now &#8220;guilty by association&#8221;.  That such a thesis was even accepted indicates their silent assent to the drivel written by her and others of her ilk.  </p>

<p>I take it, you are a college prof Cassiodorus? I&rsquo;m trying to remember&hellip; It was my experience at college, anyway, that instructors would grade black students just as harshly. I never did look at (their) final grade tho! I really didn&rsquo;t see any reason to believe there was a difference in the grading. If I was a teacher, I personally, like Bill Clinton did, might considered increasing their grade. I saw no difference in grade&hellip; only an entire university - an entire society geared toward them and their insane beliefs at the expense of racist whites who were only taught to hate themselves.</p>
<p>If this view became common, that there was a seperate grading system for certain non-whites, wouldn&rsquo;t the non-whites in question begin to relax and take on an attitude, so common among whites, that they have nothing in the world to worry about ever? Just a thought. One I&rsquo;m not that interested in really. Non-whites have enough people looking out for their every whim already.</p>
<p>I was really hoping to get a lively debate going about Ms. Obama&rsquo;s IQ&hellip; waiting a day and a half between postings isn&rsquo;t helping much. </p>

<p>Used to be, but anyone who has access to a newspaper ought to understand the basic facts. Mrs. Obama would not in fact have been admitted to college or law school if she had not been black, as her grades and test scores were inadequate. That is a matter of public record. In many recent and not-so-recent court cases (Bakke, Hopwood, Michigan) involving AA admissions the white plaintiffs have pointed out that there is no overlap *at all* between white and black admits, that is, the very lowest-scoring admitted white on the roster scored higher than the highest scoring black, who was invariably outscored by many white applicants who were not admitted. (It&rsquo;s worth pointing out in this context that &#8220;Martin Luther&#8221; King was admitted to Boston University&rsquo;s graduate school of divinity on the basis of GRE scores the *highest* of which was his score in philosophy, his undergraduate major, which placed him in the *bottom third* of all takers of that test. His verbal score was somewhere in the *bottom 25%* Nor was he expelled for his blatant plagiarism, though at least one member of his doctoral committee knew all about it). Of course Mrs. Obama was far less qualified than an average white Princeton student. It would be interesting to know her IQ, but I suspect we&rsquo;re not going to find out for the same reason Princeton kept trying to hide her thesis. Certainly we can make some educated guesses based on her public statements and writings. The consensus here is correct; she&rsquo;s not very impressive.</p>
<p>As far as grades are concerned, the pressure to pass black students is very considerable. When even good schools institute failure-proof programs more or less explicitly designed for blacks, eg. &#8220;black studies,&#8221; it is clear that giving blacks autonomous homeland academic departments and applying different academic standards to them is part of the agenda. A couple of years ago we had a brief debate on these boards with a &#8220;black studies&#8221; professor from one of the Big Ten universities. It was a remarkable performance. His posts were manifestly illiterate, but when this was pointed out to him he huffed and puffed that he was too busy correcting Ignorant Racists to be bothered with English correct enough for a class of third-grade whites, and he concluded with &#8220;BLACK STUDIES RULES&#8221; and &#8220;GO TO HELL.&#8221; That combination of incompetence and attitude tells you a great deal about the academic environment most blacks inhabit. </p>
