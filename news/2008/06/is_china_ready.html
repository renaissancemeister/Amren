<h1><a href="https://www.teachabroadchina.com/barak-obama-president-china/">Is China Ready for Barak Obama?</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Vance, China Teaching Web, June 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t have a problem with black people,&#8221; a Chinese student recently stated in one of my classes. &#8220;It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t understand their language or their culture very well.&#8221; {snip} But now that Mr. Obama has finally clinched the nomination, some of my students have been candidly sharing their opinions about African Americans and blacks in general.</p>
<p>Most Chinese people with whom I speak on the issue of race say that they &#8220;have nothing against black people.&#8221; But many of my friends and students do seem to &lsquo;buy in&rsquo; to some of the stereotypes of black people that have always existed. For example, a student recently told me that she &#8220;is a little scared of black people&#8221; because they are big and strong. Others have said that their black English teachers teachers were always kind but they often smelled bad. Still other students have said they have never really met a black person so they have no opinion of them. A few have even asked me about whether or not there are more black people involved in crime in the U.S. than white people. {snip}</p>
<p>As a teacher, I always try to help my Chinese students to understand that such stereotypes are unfair and can be perceived as racist. I explain to my students that there are many African Americans who have achieved great success in the United States. {snip}</p>
<p>Why is it so difficult for them to conceive of a black man in charge of America? The answer is quite simple. When Chinese people think of America, they think of the color white. Chinese women use umbrellas in the sun to keep their pale skin while both Chinese men and women try to change their hair color to blond or at least something lighter. {snip}</p>
<p>The belief that racism is still very prevalent in China is another reason why some Chinese people have been &lsquo;caught off guard&rsquo; by Obama&rsquo;s success in the U.S. A young Chinese lady who was engaged to a foreigner told me recently that her parents were worried about her future in America because they had heard that &#8220;Chinese people&rsquo; and other minorities were treated as &#8220;third class citizens.&#8221; Whether or not such beliefs are true, many Chinese people are amazed that a minority person would ever have a chance at achieving the world&rsquo;s most powerful position.</p>
<p>Some in China are willing to say of Obama words that few Americans would dare to utter in public. On Monday, an editorial in the the People&rsquo;s Daily Online in China proclaimed that &#8220;one of the causes for the Western media to lavish overpraises onto Obama is owed to his (skin) color, and the other cause is the change that he may bring to American society.&#8221; This online newspaper, which speaks for the government, seems also to speak for the Chinese people. {snip}<br>

			<p>Success=White, Building=White, Progress=White but American doesn&rsquo;t seem to equal much of anything anymore. Illegal invaders come in and tell us what to do, and we obey giving all they ask for and more. They spit on our Holy Books, ridicule our God and then demand and collect on one of us looking at their book of mischief in a way they don&rsquo;t like. The worst part is WE bow down to their demands..</p>

			<p>In so much of the world, a black (or woman) US President would not be taken seriously&hellip;I&rsquo;ve often wondered how Condoleeza Rice is percieved in the Middle East. Kind of like two strikes against her from the get-go, fair or not.</p>

			<p>Full credit to those Chinese students for taking in the evidence of their experiences and making sound judgements based on it.</p>
<p>P.S. If a stereotype has been around forever, does that not lend credence to it? Does Mr. Yance think his, and our, ancestors have been a succession of fools and bigots, and is that not itself a highly prejudiced view?</p>

			<p>Why is it racist to point out blacks have higher testosterone than asians, and are thus &#8216;bigger and stronger,&rsquo; while also being &#8216;more impulsive and aggressive&rsquo; and thus more criminal?</p>
<p>This is just the truth.</p>
<p>A few exceptions to this rule don&rsquo;t disprove the average, aggregate results.  He is lying to them.</p>

			<p>There is good reason to fear the response of China if Obama is elected.  They will rightly read this as an extreme weakening of America&rsquo;s position and prestige in the world.</p>
<p>That loss of respect could cause them to become emboldened.</p>

			<p>If he were elected, Chinese politicians would have a dim view of his abilities and his administration.  Hopefully, they would be underestimating us - that is, if Obama were to choose sharp people for his administration.  Unfortunately, I expect that he would live &#8216;up&rsquo; to their underestimations.</p>
<p>His election would simply prove once and for all to me that this country is now run by &#8216;mob rule&rsquo; democracy, and is no longer a republic.  </p>
<p>Obama feels little or no tie to the white side of his heritage, the side that brought civilization to this continent.  Why would we expect him to uphold and continue the traditions of that civilization and heritage?  I don&rsquo;t know what he will do, but I cringe to think of how he will describe our founding fathers, how he will wax pedantic at Kwanzaa-time, how he will undermine our pride in the history and greatness of this country.  I am sure that every token word to whites will be followed by a caveat.  </p>
<p>We will be urged to give up our entire worldview and accede to the moral superiority of non-whites, asserted in direct proportion to their historical failures.</p>
<p>Honestly, can you see Obama claiming the heritage of the founding fathers as his own, and powerfully asserting everything they stood for to the rest of the world?  Or do you see him taking a wishy-washy bureaucrat role like the umpteen spectacularly unremarkable leaders of European countries?  The latter, of course&hellip;</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe he will convince the Chinese that blacks are all cool sharp dudes, and they will waste a trillion or so trying to work with Africans&hellip;<br>

<p>&ldquo;As a teacher, I always try to help my Chinese students to understand that such stereotypes are unfair and can be perceived as racist. I explain to my students that there are many African Americans who have achieved great success in the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John PM translates:</p>
<p>&lsquo;As a piece of brainwashed Marxist self-hating white garbage, I always try to lower the natural and healthy defenses of my Chinese quarries, so that they may be victimized by blacks with impunity, should they ever have the &ldquo;luck&rdquo; to be enriched by them. I deviously explain to my quarries that there are many Affirmative Americans, who would &ldquo;never&rdquo; harm them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Enough said,</p>

			<p>If people think the Chinese are arrogant and outright hostile towards us now, with the feckless Bush in charge, just imagine what things will be like when they see a Third Worlder is in charge of the US. Obama, they will observe, correctly, is just like the weak willed, corrupt Hottentots they have already bought off and shoved around all over Africa.  And they own our debt, our industries, and have probably stolen every military and industrial secret we have.  The Dalai-bama will be a disaster. But so will Free Trader McCain. We are doomed.</p>

			<p>Not to worry, China. AMERICA IS NOT READY FOR ANOTHER LYING PHONY OF A PRESIDENT, EITHER!</p>
<p>Like that inredible compilation of lies, distortions and half-truths in his &#8216;biography.&rsquo; Those meaningless statements and promises he drops on the adoring crowds. Half of those people in the newscasts look spaced out   &mdash;   on drugs or alcohol. Like our erstwhile 1960s era hippies. Damned few RATIONAL people buy into the Obamination&rsquo;s empty rhetoric.</p>

			<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, didn&rsquo;t Putin recently make Condoleezza Rice sit outside his office waiting for several hours on her recent visit to Russia? I have heard some say it was a snub at the US Administration for sending a black female on the visit, no matter what her appointed position. Most of the world is not filled with metrosexual types who lament Jim Crow and want to reach out and show that they are not a &#8220;typical White person.&#8221; Or a typical Asian, Arab, etc.</p>
<p>Today on the radio, a foul-mouthed leftist jock was going on and on comparing Kennedy to Obama saying that Kennedy&rsquo;s bold moves during the Cuban Missle Crisis helped avoid nuclear catastrophe despite the criticisms of his inexperience and youth. That may very well be, but she failed to mention the view that the reason the Cuban Missile Crisis emerged was because the Russians were testing the mettle of what they viewed as a weak leader in Kennedy. </p>
<p>Young, inexperienced, and President only by a narrow (and probably stolen) electoral victory - the Russians smelled opportunity in the air and took a chance they may not have tried had Nixon been in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>With most Obama supporters voting for him for mere tokenism (the chance to vote for the first black President), is it difficult to fathom that many of the USA&rsquo;s enemies are eager for his victory for a similar set of reasons?</p>

			<p>This is why Obama will win. This country lost its focus long ago. The U.S. got too big for its britches long before I was born. It matters not what China, Kenya, or any undocumented, non-U.S. citizen thinks of U.S. politics. </p>
<p>I also think of whites when I think of America. McCain is closer to what this country stands for and what it was founded on. He&rsquo;s gotten caught up in the political game. Maybe we real conservatives can straighten him out. I&rsquo;ll take McCain over <br>
Mr. Potatohead for a President. </p>

<p>Yes, all these non-whites love to believe America is so &#8220;racist&#8221; yet they still keep coming. Speaking of racism, whites or any other race are not allowed to immigrate to China and China supresses the few minority cultures it does have. I&rsquo;m sick of America being accused of &#8220;racism&#8221; by non-whites, like the Chinese, who are as racist as you can get.</p>

<p>She is partially right, there is definitely a racial hierarchy here in America:</p>
<p>#1-Blacks-the darlings of the US. They can do no wrong and everything is white people&rsquo;s fault.<br>
#2-Hispanics-Second only to blacks. They have the right to come here illegally and march in our streets waving their flags. <br>
#3-Asians-though not looked upon as &#8220;victims&#8221; still being non-white gives rights above the evil whites.<br>
#4-Whites-Whites are the epitome of what is wrong in the world. All whites are racist and are oppressiing the minorities and are responsbile for all of their ills. Thus whites come last and must be in continuous subservience to other races.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Is China ready for Obama&#8221;???</p>
<p>Who cares???? </p>
<p>&#8220;Why is it so difficult for them to conceive of a black man in charge of America? The answer is quite simple. When Chinese people think of America, they think of the color white&#8221;</p>
<p>And when people think of China, they think of Chinese, DUH!!!!</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether or not such beliefs are true, many Chinese people are amazed that a minority person would ever have a chance at achieving the world&rsquo;s most powerful position.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes and what are the odds that a white could be elected to head up China? a black? anybody not Chinese? The answer is a big fat ZERO.</p>
<p>&#8220;future in America because they had heard that &ldquo;Chinese people&rsquo; and other minorities were treated as &ldquo;third class citizens.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>China is one of the most ethnocentric and racist countries on the planet, far more than the US or any other so-called &#8220;white&#8221; country . They have no business accusing anyone of racism. They, unlike the USA, have no blacks, mexicans or others so NO understanding. <br>

<p>On another note, doesn&rsquo;t a statement like this negate the writer&rsquo;s probable belief in &#8220;moral relativism?&#8221; </p>
<p>After all, who is he, as a Western journalist, to judge a non-White culture on their racial perceptions, especially that of a Communist nation?</p>
<p>Golly, with all of this back-tracking and hypocrisy, who are we as &#8220;typical White people&#8221; supposed to take ethical guidance from nowadays? I guess we should &#8220;Tivo&#8221; Keith Olbermann every night and watch several times over just to make sure this week&rsquo;s moral message really sinks in.</p>

<p>I can tell you how Condoleeza Rice is viewed in the middle east! The real Arabs, the Saudis and Kuwaitis do not like blacks and the Muslim men DO NOT like talking to women about politics. It is an insult of the highest magnitude in Arab culture to send a BLACK WOMAN to talk of politics with the Arabs, and our country will suffer for it. Not that I like Saudis or Kuwaitis but I think Rice is being sent over here to slap the Arabs in the face and I do sort of like that.</p>

			<p>Chances are, some of those students will some day find themselves in America.  Having been mislead by Mr. Vance, they will think it&rsquo;s perfectly safe to wander black areas at night.  She will be killed or raped and her blood will be on his hands.  That that are many blacks who have achieved success in the U.S. has nothing to do with whether or not blacks are more likely to be criminals.  Both statements are true.  Many blacks have achieved success here.  Many are upstanding citizens as well.  Nevertheless, as a group, they are far more dangerous to be around than whites.  Certainly more so than Asians.  Alas, those students will not read Amren.  Instead they will either live in ignorance, spreading untruths to many other Chinese or they will end up learning the hard way.  A responsible person, in Mr. Vance&rsquo;s position, would at least mention how Asians are frequently targeted by blacks for persecution.  Such knowledge might save somebody&rsquo;s life some day.</p>

			<p>She is partially right, there is definitely a racial hierarchy here in America:</p>
<p>#1-Blacks-the darlings of the US. They can do no wrong and everything is white people&rsquo;s fault.<br>
#2-Hispanics-Second only to blacks. They have the right to come here illegally and march in our streets waving their flags. </p>
<p>#3-Asians-though not looked upon as &ldquo;victims&rdquo; still being non-white gives rights above the evil whites.</p>
<p>#4-Whites-Whites are the epitome of what is wrong in the world. All whites are racist and are oppressiing the minorities and are responsbile for all of their ills. Thus whites come last and must be in continuous subservience to other races.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>All very true, but then whites rarely raise their voices to complain when they are treated this way by the Marxist media, or when being shouted down by the likes of Sharpton. It seems today, the greatest fear among whites is the dreaded R word. They have allowed themselves to be programed to be ashamed of who they are and so fearful of being called racist, they won&rsquo;t even stand up for their people. Even though every other race or ethnic group can freely speak out in defense of their own. As long as Whites accept this, and as long themselves to be intimidated this unfair and non-equal treatment, will continue. In other words, Whites need to grow a spine. </p>

<p>I agree completely but many of our graduate Chinese students who have been to such diverse places like New York City, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Chicago find out quickly. It&rsquo;s the Chinese students who come directly to our small college town, who are being duped by liberal brainwashing, that are in danger of being victimized by criminal blacks. </p>

			<p>The Chinese are taking full advantage of our derailment and focusing on leading the world in the next century. They pity us as a country and civilization in decline as they race for the top. </p>
<p>We overcame transcendentalized atheistic Marxist-Leninism by disempowering the Soviet Union but we are simply empowering China&rsquo;s Communist party and guess what? At some point in the future, we will find ourselves back in another Cold War. </p>
<p>China is not going to fall apart or become a Democracy. That&rsquo;s a modern liberal media fantasy. They fully intend for their one party Communist authoritarian rule to become the predominant worldview in a hundred years. And we will help them accomplish it. Neither the soothing scenario nor the upheaval scenario preached on the nightly news by elitist globalists will change China&rsquo;s one party Communist party system. </p>
<p>We will help China become the world&rsquo;s greatest superpower, engage them in Cold War, and end playing the role the Soviet Union did (e.g. loser). </p>

<p>Dream on Cliff.  As long as nature dictates that blacks will not be equal to whites in certain areas, cries of racism will continue full force. </p>
<p>The source of the problem is that the leftist establishment has adopted the position, as a matter of faith, that all races must be perfectly equal intellectually.  Anybody who questions this faith is a &#8220;heretic&#8221;.  Therefore they can never rise above their ignorance and prejudice.  When they see the results of disparate abilities - in their eyes it&rsquo;s evidence of &#8220;racism&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s hard to become enlightened when you can&rsquo;t allow yourself to even read opposing viewpoints.  All this would be well and good - except that mother-nature doesn&rsquo;t care about dogma, religious faith or political correctness.  She just keeps on doing what she&rsquo;s been doing for millions of years, oblivious to sensitivities or propaganda.  Eventually, the leftists will have to yield to mother-nature.  But, considering how long it took other religions to wake up (hundreds of years), don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>

<p>The journalist who wrote this article evidently is also a teacher of English or some other subject to Chinese young people.</p>
<p>Any American with a degree in Education in these times will have been above all else trained in race-relations along the egalitarian lines. In fact, I think it is doubtful that many race realists would set out to earn a degree in Education. I can say that in my case, I dropped out of college because I did not want a degree in Education, which is what the university was insisting on. I did not want to be a part of the egalitarian religion and be guilty of injury to young minds in brainwashing them in such propaganda.</p>
<p>So it is not surprising to me that Mr. Vance would attempt to teach his Chinese students the same doctrines he would have to teach in the States. I believe that a majority of educators now actually believe that &#8216;diversity is our greatest strength.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Exactly, this is the problem with a lot of people. They don&rsquo;t look at the big picture. Yes, there are good and bad in all races as well as intelligent and stupid in all races but certain groups as a whole are achieve far more or have much higher crime rates and are much more dangerous in large numbers.</p>

<p> Yeah sure, as opposed to say invading another country under fasle accusations of WMD, destroying said country, killing untold numbers of them, wounding still more, and making countless numbers of them homeless. Then wanting the &#8220;right&#8221; for 58 military bases, immunity for the troops there and control of your country&rsquo;s principal resource. </p>

			<p>Despite the dumb way the US liberated Iraq, they did just that, liberated it. Iraq did have WMD. Read General Sada&rsquo;s book about how they were transported on converted passenger jets just before the attack. Bush is just too dumb to even defend himself.<br>
WE didn&rsquo;t destroy the country or kill &#8220;untold numbers&#8221;. <br>
We took out Saddam and then tried to rebuild Iraq. Maybe it was a stupid idea to think they were capable of having a better country, but we didn&rsquo;t destroy it, The crazy Islamists did. Al Qaeda. The Sunnis. Al Sadr. Iran. THEY planted the bombs in market places, they beheaded the little girls, baked the little boys in front of their families, built the torture rooms, started civil wars, blew up schools, blew up power stations, blew up brave people trying to drag their country out of the third world dictatorship pit it was in. <br>
And the oil contracts all went to Asian countries, not to Bush&rsquo;s supposed cronies back in Texas. <br>
Bush&rsquo;s big mistake was&hellip;he was too liberal. He really thought a bunch of backward Arab Muslims could lift themselves overnight into a peaceful, cooperative society. He was wrong. <br>

			<p>&ldquo;As a teacher, I always try to help my Chinese students to understand that such stereotypes are unfair and can be perceived as racist. I explain to my students that there are many African Americans who have achieved great success in the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a teacher myself also currently residing abroad and teaching English in East Asia, I can say that I do my utmost &hellip;in an intelligent, subtle, and tactful way&hellip; to negate all the doe-eyed, naive, egalitarian gibberrish being spouted by the all-too-numerous Robert B. Nance&rsquo;s over here.  Obviously Nance has NEVER had dealings with Blacks during his indoctrination period in the Ivory Towers of Marxist Academia.  As another poster here perceptively noted, the kind of nonsense Nance is spouting is going to get some Chinese kid killed or some Chinese girl raped by some thug, and it will be THIS GUY&rsquo;s fault for blatantly misleading them on the REALITY of race-relations in America.</p>
<p>Check the statistics, Nance, before you go endangering those kids&rsquo; lives. Instead, tell them the TRUTH.  The truth being: Don&rsquo;t trust them.  If they approach you, walk away.  If in a place where a large number of Blacks are present, LEAVE immediately.  I have a sadly factual anecdote of an Asian convenience store owner executed in front of his family by some thug on parole for the $400 in the register that I drag out from time to time.  THIS is the reality of Black-Asian relations in America.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T TRUST THEM, EVER!</p>
<p>On Obama, I give them the analogy of &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been teaching here two years, so does that qualify me to become Principal?&#8221; and leave it at that.  That is enough.  With all due respect to the Barr and Baldwin and Paul supporters, don&rsquo;t &#8220;vote on principle&#8221; and end up indirectly electing Obama President.  If Obama is elected in November, we all KNOW what is going to happen&hellip; and if Obama is NOT elected in November, we all KNOW what is going to happen.  <br>

			<p>To Robert Vance @20:</p>
<p>I made a number of ethnographic and sociological observations in my comment above. Can you actually refute any of them? Of course not - you know it and so do I. Clearly, you are one of those weak, &lsquo;anti-racist&rsquo;, self-hating whites to which I referred.</p>
<p>Could you explain your anti-racism to me? Why does the making of unflattering, but true, remarks about non-whites bother you? Why are you &ldquo;appalled&rdquo;? Shouldn&rsquo;t you be &ldquo;appalled&rdquo; at the truly appalling behavior of blacks, in the US and everwhere else, and not at those whites, like me, resentful of it? Are you a criminal? If not, why make excuses for criminals (or their racial apologists: Barack Obama, Jeremiah Wright, Al Sharpton, etc ad nauseam)? If you are a member of the white race, aren&rsquo;t you concerned with its preservation, welfare, and future success? Don&rsquo;t you think it strange not to be? I confess, I might perhaps have been (barely) able to understand white &lsquo;antiracism&rsquo; before the &ldquo;civil rights movement&rdquo;; after 45 years of nation- and quality of life-killing racial integration, I am utterly bewildered that ANY white is NOT a racist. Do you actually believe that the presence of integrated blacks (and other minorities) improves thelives of whites? How? Better, how could you? It&rsquo;s just too bizarre!</p>
<p>It seems to me that the West has had its little experiment or fling with the daily joys of nonwhiteness, and that everywhere it has proven an expensive, annoying, and often lethal failure. That any white today worries more about racism in his own racial ranks, than about alien racial aggression and white governmental appeasement of same, is remarkable, even mindboggling. I really wish someone could explain so &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; a mindset to me.<br>

			<p>The Japanese were not defeated by blacks.  The Chinese and North Koreans were not fought to a standstill by blacks in the Korean War.  With a black president, they will lose all remaining respect for the USA.  They will detach themselves from the dollar and from the USA.  They will form there own Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere that excludes the USA.  Without the Asian subsidies, the USA&rsquo;s standard of living will drop to the level of Latino countries.   Prepare yourselves.  Invest in things that go up when the dollar goes down.  Assume massive inflation.   There is no longer a &#8220;wise&#8221; older white generation to take care of things.  There is no more &#8220;muddling through&#8221;.  If you want to survive, you have got to research stuff and do it yourself.</p>
