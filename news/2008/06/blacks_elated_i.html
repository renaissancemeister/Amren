<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24979148/">Blacks Elated, Incredulous after Obama Win </a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eli Saslow and Jonathan Mummolo, Washington Post, June 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The final reality of Obama&rsquo;s victory over Hillary Rodham Clinton, predestined for weeks, <br>
still struck Obama&rsquo;s supporters   &mdash;   young and old, white and black, the believers and the <br>
skeptics   &mdash;   with the sudden weight of history.</p>
<p>For some black Americans, the impact of his win reached into the improbable, registering <br>
as a shock inconsistent with a lifetime of experience. Adrian Cheeks, 45, from Falls <br>
Church, had considered Obama&rsquo;s candidacy a &#8220;chance in hell   &mdash;   snowball.&#8221; Mildred Taylor, <br>
80, from Los Angeles, was convinced she&rsquo;d never see a black president in her lifetime.</p>
<p>Reveling in Obama&rsquo;s historic achievement, a California man planned a cemetery visit to <br>
share the news with a dead relative. Others taped Obama&rsquo;s picture to their front doors. <br>
Many considered the possibility of a black president with a woman for his running mate <br>
and marveled at how drastically the world had changed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re getting there&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m amazed that we&rsquo;ve grown up,&#8221; said Crystal Hill, 31, an African American who lives in <br>
Northwest Washington. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve still got a long way to go, but we&rsquo;re getting there.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Tamim Rahim, 21, of the Chantilly area, Obama&rsquo;s ability to fight through one of the <br>
most bruising nomination battles in history, combined with the historic obstacle of his <br>
ethnicity, proved the candidate&rsquo;s mettle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite honestly, when Obama first started, I didn&rsquo;t think he was going to go too far,&#8221; <br>
said Rahim, who is of Afghan descent. &#8220;I know 100 years ago no one would have thought an <br>
African American would get this&hellip; . He went through a lot of difficult obstacles&hellip; . I think he&rsquo;s made his point. In my mind, he&rsquo;s won his battles.&#8221;</p>
<p>But for some, looking ahead to Obama&rsquo;s remaining battle against John McCain, skepticism <br>
still lurked: Could this really happen again?</p>
<p>&#8220;It does say something about how far the country has come along,&#8221; said Cheeks, an <br>
information-technology support technician. &#8220;Now comes the real test. You still have a <br>
core group of Americans who will not vote for him because of the color of his skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of Obama&rsquo;s younger supporters chose a more hopeful outlook. In downtown Washington, <br>
Becky Ogunwo, 20, handed out brochures about environmental issues and gushed, &#8220;We&rsquo;re a <br>
much more diverse country in our thinking now.&#8221; Donte Frazier, a 32-year-old local cook, <br>
talked about &#8220;a moment of hope.&#8221; Keisha Brown, 21, from Chicago, whose mother has a <br>
nightgown with a picture of Obama on it, said, &#8220;Everything will be different now.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For Obama&rsquo;s supporters, the mere taste of history made them antsy for more. They said <br>
Obama has built the perfect coalition to defeat McCain: young Americans, black Americans, <br>
college-educated Americans   &mdash;   all voting in record numbers, and all inspired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama was very successful with bringing in so many new voters,&#8221; said Maury Tobin, 39, a <br>
white communications consultant from Port Tobacco, Md. &#8220;If they came out and voted for <br>
him in the primary in record numbers, they&rsquo;re going to come out again in the general. <br>
That&rsquo;s going to put some states in play for the Democrats that they never imagined would <br>
be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if all goes according to plan, Obama supporters said, there will be a lot more <br>
history to celebrate.</p>

<p>Anyone surprised by this woman&rsquo;s response? IMO, obama could get elected, affirmative action reinstituted everywhere, reperations paid out to all blacks, and most blacks and white liberals would still say we have a long way to go. These people will never be satisfied. Ever.<br>

			<p>I think both Obama and McCain are awful candidates.  Obama is fashionable but vacuous while McCain is extremely bellicose and antagonist.</p>
<p>I think this election is analogous to Frost&rsquo;s poem Fire and Ice:</p>
<p><br>
Some say the world will end in fire,<br>
Some say in ice.<br>
From what I&rsquo;ve tasted of desire<br>
I hold with those who favor fire.<br>
But if it had to perish twice,<br>
I think I know enough of hate<br>
To say that for destruction ice<br>
Is also great<br>
And would suffice. </p>
<p>So will it be by fire or ice?</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting there to them means giving them things they can&rsquo;t earn, above and beyond what they&rsquo;re very generously awarded right now.  And &#8220;growing up&#8221; means about the same.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why a good percentage of them like communism so much, and Castro.  The system allots things on a bean counting basis, rather than a merit one, so that way blacks are assured they<br>
have a chance at positions that are above their abilities to earn.</p>
<p>America will forever be &#8220;racist&#8221; to these people so long as success is based on ability.  They&rsquo;ve had decades now with privileges that whites do not have to show everybody what they can do, but they continue to fail.  All the races in this country surpass them in almost every way, yet they still wail the worn out mantra that white oppression and discrimination keep them down.  It is black inability and lack of intelligence that keep them down.</p>
<p>Blacks are the curse of the entire Western world.</p>

			<p>For certain if Obamanation gets in he will set to work immediately &#8220;giving&#8221; his black brothers another leg up BESIDES all their other perks, but, in the last analysis, what good will it do them?  I mean, how much good did it do them to have Colin Powell in or Rice?  No, neither were pres, but there&rsquo;s not THAT much difference.  There&rsquo;s just so much the pres can do.   And, yes, the overall black image is somewhat improved, but how about the overall situation for the average black?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet after this black racist&rsquo;s tenure in office blacks as a group will be hardly better off than they were before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet the black whining will continue just as it does today.</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about; the African &#8216;Big Chief Syndrome&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Blacks all over the world believe that once their man (be they a tribal chief or a major of a city in the US) is elected, everything is going to change overnight and that they&rsquo;re going to have immediate access to money and power in every sector of society.</p>
<p>Although he hasn&rsquo;t won yet, considering how Bush II has devastated the Republican party and a Republican presidency, he has a shot. Winning is only the beginning. What he does or tries to do is speculation at this time.</p>
<p>If he wins, blacks are going to expect a big and immediate pay-off which is something he won&rsquo;t be able to deliver. They&rsquo;re going to expect that &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo; will be eliminated within weeks of his swearing. They&rsquo;re going to expect that once &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo; has been eliminated, their kids are going to perform as academically good, if not better, than white kids because they know that what was always holding them back was &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo;. Apply that belief system to every segment of society and the average black man on the street is going to be very disappointed in Obama as president. They will blame his failure on two things: institutional racism and the white supremists power structure, and the fact that Obama isn&rsquo;t black enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another dream that will be spoiled by racial reality.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget about the 2/3 of Whites who didn&rsquo;t vote for him and least of all don&rsquo;t forget those angry White women who&rsquo;ll be voting in record numbers this November for the other team.</p>

			<p>I am incredulous, too, but not at what they are incredulous about. </p>
<p>They are incredulous that Whites are voting for Obama; I am incredulous about what happens after that.</p>
<p>What happens after that? The Whites who voted for Obama look for approval, strokes, affirmation, for what they did. They look to people of another race for this. Another race, who, on their own, doesn&rsquo;t seem to have accomplished a darn thing, in the realm of science, philosophy, religion, or art.</p>
<p>The Whites look to these people for approval.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it is the liberals they look to for approval. They have not accomplished a darn thing, either, except playing around with words and images on TV. They have DONE nothing.</p>
<p>I am absolutely incredulous.</p>
<p>Sometimes, thinking in religious terms, I think that God has given up on us, and we have been handed over to diabolical deception.</p>
<p>It is starting to look that way. </p>

 This is true, but the same could be said for the large number of people who voted for him only because of the color of his skin. There is such a double standard in the US</p>

			<p>If his deadbeat Kenyan father is still around, you can bet that he will suddenly jump out of the woodwork should Obama be elected.Just like so many of these deadbeat black fathers of these wealthy, pampered, blackskin privilidged athletes who show up if and only if their offspring suddenly come upon a lot of moolah.</p>

			<p>The first black person to play Major League Baseball was the Dodgers&rsquo; Jackie Robinson. </p>
<p>The first black man to win an Emmy Award was Harry Belafonte. </p>
<p>The first black man to win an Oscar for Best Actor was Sidney Potier. </p>
<p>The first black man to be appointed a Justice of the US Supreme Court was Thurgood Marshall. </p>
<p>The first black man to have a book named as a Book of the Month Club selection was Richard Wright. </p>
<p>The first black man to win four gold medals in the Olympics was Jesse Owens. </p>
<p>The first black man to win the major tennis titles was Arthur Ashe. </p>
<p>The first black man to win the Nobel Peace prize was Ralph Bunche. </p>
<p>The first black man to be named Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Adviser to the President,and Secretary of State, was General Colin Powell. As CJCS, General Powell was the Senior Flag Officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>
<p>Barrack Hussein Obama, the first black man to win the nomination of a major political party for the office of President, isn&rsquo;t qualified to carry the bags of any of the men mentioned above.</p>
<p>I had in mind another way of phrasing my opinion of Obama, but I will be nice about it - for now.</p>

			<p>Barack Hussein is the nominee simply because the puppet-masters ordained it to be so. With the help of pathetic, self-hating whites, we are now witnessing the final deathblow of our nation. In their desire to get the proverbial monkey of racism off their backs, White America has done nothing more than vote for the insignificance of our people, culture, morals, and religious beliefs.</p>
<p>White naivete is killing us off. When you look at the white states Obama won, these are whites that have never been exposed to black culture, and if exposed, I know they would change their minds as quickly as they would change their underwear. Personally, I hope they get what they deserve, and when the final clash of &#8216;civilization&rsquo; comes, let them be the first to fall. </p>

			<p>These jubilant Africans have to realize that the empty suit from my state couldn&rsquo;t have won the nomination without:</p>
<p>1) The unwittng help of millions of Whites.<br>
2) The absolute adoration and non-critical posture of the mainstream media. </p>
<p>Thomas Sowell has described McCain and Obama as representing the difference between disgust and disaster in November.  When I go to the polls it&rsquo;ll be just like 1972 when it was either vote for the pathological (Nixon) or the pathetic (McGovern). </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right.  I will be one of those Americans.  That&rsquo;s because I understand the genetic limitations of blacks in their intelligence and ability to lead.  I see what&rsquo;s happened in Rhodesia, S. Africa, big American cities and everywhere else with a black ruler.  I can see and don&rsquo;t want that to happen this country.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;You still have a core group of Americans who will not vote for him because of the color of his skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But completely ignoring the massive number of people who are ONLY voting for Obama BECAUSE of the colour of his skin. Don&rsquo;t let the facts get in the way of an opportunity to call American whites racist.</p>

			<p><i>For some black Americans, the impact of his win reached into the improbable, registering  as a shock inconsistent with a lifetime of experience.</i></p>
<p>No, it registered  as a shock inconsistent with a lifetime of anti-white indoctrination.</p>
<p><i>Now comes the real test. You still have a core group of Americans who will not vote for him because of the color of his skin.</i></p>
<p>Hilarious. Is she talking about the 90% of blacks who won&rsquo;t vote for McCain because of the color of his skin? How about the whites who were not allowed to live in Zimbabwe because of  the color of their skin? </p>
<p>The bottom line is, this is not going to convince blacks that this is not a fundamentally racist country. Remember that a large percentage of blacks (including in Obama&rsquo;s own church) believe that AIDS was concocted by whites to kill off the black race. This is not going to convince blacks that this is not a fundamentally racist country because that is the only explanation that&rsquo;s permitted for black failure.</p>

			<p>&#8216;We&rsquo;re getting there.&rsquo;  What?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve had some bad times as a white person and have felt shunned by plenty of white people who were suppossed to know and care for me the most, I look at a person as an individual first.(I would never date a black person. Cultures are too different.) If they want to turn it into a race issue, I know I&rsquo;d have plenty to say. I know I can&rsquo;t have the full perspective of what it feels like to be a black person, but I know the difference between right and wrong.<br>
There are educated blacks that look at the issues and what has affected those issues. They&rsquo;re okay with me. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading some of Obama&rsquo;s book. I have commented before that he&rsquo;s on fire to move up in the political ranks. Senator Byrd is mentioned several times in the book. He told Obama not to move too quickly like many young politicans do. He told Obama that when some young, inexperienced men get in the Senate; they&rsquo;re ready to run for President. Byrd says there&rsquo;s much to be done in the Senate. Don&rsquo;t rush to the presidency. I guess we&rsquo;ll suffer for Obama not taking his advice. </p>

<p>Actually his marxist political views and radical associations should be reason enough not to elect him. His inexperience will make him vulnerable to manipulation by advisors. One can only imagine the make up his cabinet and his VP selection. This election will be the most significant one in our lifetimes. This Black man popularity is disturbing.</p>

<p>Hey, don&rsquo;t say that.  Blacks wreak havoc in their own neighborhoods, therefore, the violence and damage will really only affect those of us who live among them.</p>
<p>Those of us that live among them don&rsquo;t harbor such illusions about blacks.</p>

			<p>I think blacks in general are a pain in the hip pocket. But I would vote for one if he was brilliant, a patriot and I knew he would secure the borders and drastically limit immigration and then to desirable whites only. Obama is probably the most unqualified candidate in history  and far too many are treating him like he was The Second Coming. It&rsquo;s unseeing insanity.But McCain is an over the hill open borders advocate. We truly have the worst choices in history and the next four and maybe eight years are going to be Hell in this country. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;For Obama&rsquo;s supporters, the mere taste of history made them antsy for more. They said <br>
Obama has built the perfect coalition to defeat McCain: young Americans, black Americans, college-educated Americans  &mdash;  all voting in record numbers, and all inspired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please, hand me a puke pail!</p>
<p>The one thing that sickens me most about this whole feeding frenzy of &ldquo;hope&rdquo; and &ldquo;history,&rdquo; is that it honestly lowers my opinion of my own people (particularly the young ones) about three notches. Yes, the Young Pioneers of Multiculturalism will be out in droves, to vote for the Marxist and Mau Mau destruction of this country. Yes, I know that not all of them will vote for this fool, but enough will and that is what fills me with an unmitigated contempt. Their blind and robotic joy, at seeing this completely abjectly worthless and incompetent mulatto (who clearly hates whites, if you read his book &ldquo;Dreams Of My Father,&rdquo; you have no doubts about that) and buying into the media hype and hyperbole designed to boost, what was unmistakably a rather lackluster victory.</p>
<p>Much is said about the &ldquo;core group of Americans who will not vote for him because of the color of his skin,&rdquo; but little about their opposite numbers who will do so only because of it. They refuse to look at the paucity of both his experience and abilities (to say nothing of the Red coloring of his politics) and with swooning abandon declare that they are for &ldquo;change&rdquo; and of course &ldquo;hope.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

None of this will change, even if he makes it all the way to the Whitehouse.

			<p>Well, Chrissy Mathews has been a major promter of Obama the day Obama spoke at the Democrtic National Conventional. I fully expect Chris Mathews to be have tears rolling down his cheeks 11:00 PM Nov 4 when Obama is elected president.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, Chris Mathews would like to see Barack Obama coronated and installed as royalty. Chris Mathews has very strong undemocratic tendencies.He recently refered to Barack Obama and his wife Michelle as the new Camelot. Chris Mathews is a really disgusting character. As other people have pointed out, millionaire White Liberals such as Chris Mathews will make the rest of us pay the high price for his liberal guilt.</p>

			<p>People better wake up.  The Democrats and the Republicans (I hate to say it) are not that different anymore and that can be layed in the lap completely by George W. Bush who has turned the Republicans upset down on their head.  </p>
<p>For years (and I&rsquo;ve said it too) people have been saying that when they went to the voting booth, they were voting for the lesser of 2 evils.  In this election, I believe, we&rsquo;ve got 2 total evils and it proves that we are slowing but surely moving towards a communist/socialist form of government.  People can laugh all they want.  What the communists couldn&rsquo;t and weren&rsquo;t able to accomplish in the 30&rsquo;s, 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s, in this country, they&rsquo;ve managed to completely take over the Democrat and possibly the Republican parties.  </p>
<p>There is a quote at the beginning of Mel Gibson&rsquo;s movie &#8220;Apocalypto&#8221;.  Civilizations cannot be destroyed from outside until they are destroyed from within.  Krushchev said in the 60&rsquo;s that we would destroy ourselves from within and that is exactly what has happened.  You can&rsquo;t tell me that there aren&rsquo;t better people out there who would make a much better choice for president than what we have been forced to pick from in this election.  I&rsquo;m not trying to diminish John McCain&rsquo;s military service - it was honorable and courageous but enough with the POW stuff.  And as for Obama, one need only look at who is socialized with the past 20 years.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t in good conscience vote for either of these candidates.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;getting there&#8221; means all congresspersons will be African-American.</p>
<p>Look forward to this if Obama wins:  The press will spin all debate in congress as &#8220;racist&#8221; if the particular Rep or Sen isn&rsquo;t for whatever bill the president supports.</p>
<p>It will be seen as constant battle between the &#8220;white racists&#8221; in Congress and the Messiah President Obama.</p>
<p>Another press move will probably be to suddenly discover all the fabulous success stories of African Americans and mixed race persons;  co-opting all the money Bush earmarked for AIDS (years ago) in Africa and erasing Bush out of the equation, making it appear that it was Obama&rsquo;s idea;  suddenly the war in Iraq is going swimmingly well and we&rsquo;ll have to stay the course (we&rsquo;ll be treated to all the success stories in Iraq and Afghanistan that the press just couldn&rsquo;t find during Bush&rsquo;s years), etc.</p>
<p>Nothing will change except the image that the press will present of the same facts and figures.  The same data and facts will suddenly be presented in glowing, accolade-filled articles.</p>
<p>Perception by press manipulation is EVERYTHING.  The world will suddenly be ROSY!  Except for those pesky white racists who complain about Messiah President Obama&rsquo;s policies, of course.</p>

			<p>Man, I&rsquo;m already thinking about the next round after the election.  Africans look to the big man to provide them with sinecures.  After all, what is the value of having your tribal leader in charge of the country if he cannot give his tribe jobs and wealth.</p>
<p>Obama has surrounded himself with white men, who were largely responsible for his success.  He cannot dump them for black men because he knows they would make a cockup of things.  There just aren&rsquo;t that many gifted blacks that are capable or serving at a national level. Gifted agitators ans political theater actors they may be, but lousy for senior level management positions and certainly not good enough for serious cabinet-level slots.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think that Obama is going to screw up like black South Africans did and replace a chunk of the white folks with blacks.  What a disaster that has been.  No electric power, no clean water, no highways, no sewage treatment plants, no first world.</p>

			<p>Remember, it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago that Obama wasn&rsquo;t black enough, hood enough and street enough for elected black politicians to endorse.</p>
<p>In related news, a superdelegate from St. Louis, a black woman state representative, came out for Obama a few days before Obama was thought to clinch the nomination.  She wailed on and on about how the choice between race and gender was such a difficult one for her.  (I doubt that.)  But it seems like almost every black woman superdelegate who says that winds up with Obama   &mdash;   the law of averages dictates that at least some of them would have agonized in Hillary&rsquo;s direction.</p>

<p>This is the final nail in the coffin of our once great country.  If Obama wins, the results will be as others here have already predicted.  If we think blacks are insufferable now, just wait.  The worst is yet to come.</p>
<p>If he loses, there will be riots all over again, hopefully confined to burning down their own neighborhoods as is their usual idiotic behavior.</p>
<p>Call me paranoid, but I&rsquo;ve believed from the beginning that Obama was already chosen to be the Democratic candidate, and this whole campaigning thing was just for show.  Give the illusion that there really is a choice, so to speak.  The powers-that-be had already picked him as the contender way back when.</p>
<p>Either way, the last nail in the coffin of our once great land is being hammered into place.</p>

<p>I went to the mall the other day.  While there in a store with my wife this teenager who looked Brazillian to me, was dressed and wore his hair in a manner so as to look appealing to girls.  He worked in a teen girls clothing store.  I studied him as he interacted with my wife.  And it dawned on me that the liberal elite swoon over guys like this, looking at him as if he&rsquo;s exotic and brings a vibrancy that us whites supposedly lack.  Well - have you ever realized that most of the global population looks very similar to this guy?  Black hair, brown/dark eyes and dark skin.  That&rsquo;s what most of the world looks like!  Whites are small sliver of the global population and yet we&rsquo;re told to look upon guys like this as exotic?  I thought exotic was something that was rare!?</p>

			<p>My dear fellow Amreners, I just feel like noting how nice it is to come to this site and read through the commentary on the various articles after absorbing more than enough network TV coverage of the farce that is this year&rsquo;s democratic nomination process.  It&rsquo;s wonderful to know there are still a few sane people left in our country.  You realize, of course, we are the heretics of our time.  We are that small minority of truth-tellers which those in power want to suppress.  It&rsquo;s a process that has played out in history many times before, and if we&rsquo;re lucky, some of us may live to see the truth ultimately win out.  But not before more persecution.  Socialist theory is the superstition of the age, and until enough people cut through its nonsense and challenge its power structures, we&rsquo;ll ALL continue to suffer under its distortions of reality.</p>
<p>With all that said   &mdash;   let&rsquo;s get ready for the riots.  Whether Barack wins or loses, I expect blacks somewhere, on some scale, to burn something.  </p>
<p>Aside from that, I&rsquo;m tempted to offer a prediction as to how things will go if Obama is elected, but it&rsquo;s so difficult to say.  We know of course that between now and the election and his inauguration and his first 6 months in office (assuming he wins), all we&rsquo;ll be hearing about is &#8220;The First African-American President&hellip;&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m already nauseous.  The question is, though, how will the black population react?  Another poster predicted they&rsquo;ll be monumentally disappointed because their fantasies about equality and the redistribution of wealth won&rsquo;t automatically be fulfilled upon Obama taking office.  They could become even more frustrated and violent.  I suspect though, if nothing else, we&rsquo;ll be treated to a certain smugness among blacks, constantly reminding us Whites that &#8220;one of their own&#8221; occupies the White House and &#8220;rules over us&#8221;.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dark time for America (pun intended).  Above all, though, I hope that we might see a seismic shift in White attitudes, White social behavior.  An Obama presidency *could be* (though there&rsquo;s no guarantee that it will be) a decisive moment in American history   &mdash;   though we Whites (the sane ones) grumble about a black president, the end of an era in American history, and so on, it could actually work to our greater advantage by shining light on the superstitions of our time.  Time will tell.  Let&rsquo;s hope that all this can somehow come to good.</p>

			<p>I know a lot of people here are worried about Obama winning but I&rsquo;m very confident he&rsquo;ll lose.  He&rsquo;ll lose BIG TIME!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things working against him.<br>
  &mdash;  He&rsquo;s up against a WAR HERO.<br>
  &mdash;  He&rsquo;s up against a man who&rsquo;s worked with Democrats. (Could sell McCain as non-partisan, a unifer.)<br>
  &mdash;  He&rsquo;s up against a man who has a heck of a lot more years in experience.<br>
  &mdash;  He&rsquo;s up against a man who can be perceived to understand foreign policy situations.<br>
  &mdash;  Many of Hillary&rsquo;s voters will vote for McCain.<br>
  &mdash;  Many of the conservatives who swore they wouldn&rsquo;t vote for McCain will. Why? Because they&rsquo;ll be so sick of the media swooning over Obama that they&rsquo;ll have to vote McCain.  (I know because I&rsquo;m one of them!  I can&rsquo;t stand McCain but now I&rsquo;ve suddenly grown to like the guy a bit and will vote for him.  Mostly to stick it in the face of guys like Chris Matthews and all of the weirdos supporting Obama.)<br>
  &mdash;  Obama isn&rsquo;t very articulate when he&rsquo;s not scripted!<br>
  &mdash;  Obama has too much baggage too many skeletons in the closet.<br>
  &mdash;  Obama&rsquo;s momentum seems to be lagging - he may have already peaked.</p>
<p>As much as we don&rsquo;t like McCain, he may be the right guy for a time such as this.  He may be the right person to defeat the &#8220;idea of electing the 1st female president&#8221; or &#8220;idea of electing the 1st black president&#8221;.  Many of Hillary and Obama supporters aren&rsquo;t voting on issues but on the idea of &#8220;making history&#8221; voting in the 1st __________.</p>

<p>Yes, they know he will continue to push for black freebies and privileges, disingenuously crying about how oppressed and reviled blacks are, and that such lamentations and incitements will create more black on white assaults and crime, which are at epidemic levels right now.</p>
<p>Now, isn&rsquo;t that racist of them to be that way?</p>
<p>And it is good to not mention that blacks vote for blacks, simply because they&rsquo;re black 92% of the time, but that isn&rsquo;t racism.</p>

<p>Good Posts Lonely Jew and Jackers.</p>
<p>In fact, if anyone is interested in a Wonderful take on just this point, then check out Tom Wolfe&rsquo;s Jefferson Lecture on video. You can see it right away on the Internet. It&rsquo;s excellent.  It&rsquo;s about an hour and a half long. But I could have listened to him go on forever. He touches on a few things in his speech, but one of them is the very demographic our two Posters mentioned above touched on. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a GREAT line from that video where he chides the MSM on the East and West Coast for acting so superior to the regular folks in between. He said, in so many words, that the Media-Elite doesn&rsquo;t get it, they&rsquo;re just the paranthesis, the entire sentence runs straight across(the country)!</p>

			<p>&#8221;..What he does or tries to do is speculation at this time&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>sbuffalo:</p>
<p>Because of the biased, swooning MSM one must dig deep to find hints at what Obama has in store for us (none of it good from what I&rsquo;ve read).  ExposeObama.com is a good place to start.</p>
<p>One example from the Center for Individual Freedom:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Obama&rsquo;s so-called Global Poverty Act (S. 2433), which according to some conservative sources, would commit all of us to a stealth United Nations-inspired global tax of $845 billion over a 13-year period   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s on top of the $300 billion per year the United States already shells out in foreign aid&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Actually his marxist political views and radical associations should be reason enough not to elect him&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by pgh at 10:23 PM on June 5 </p>
<p>Exactly Right.  If the irrational MSM or Obama lovers could or would look beyond &#8216;first black president&rsquo; and report honestly about Obama&rsquo;s blatant Marxist political views, voters might have an inkling as to what this man is planning to do to the US, especially White Americans.</p>
<p>Our Canadian posters mention the close parallel when a young Pierre Treadeau held Canada enthralled  &mdash;  with very few in the press looking at what this man actually stood for  &mdash;  the press couldn&rsquo;t get past his &#8216;energy&rsquo;, &#8216;youthfulness&rsquo; and promises of &#8216;a new age&rsquo;.  His leftist policies ran Canada into the ground, as will Obama&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;What the communists couldn&rsquo;t and weren&rsquo;t able to accomplish in the 30&rsquo;s, 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s, in this country, they&rsquo;ve managed to completely take over the Democrat and possibly the Republican parties&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gayle:</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also appointed leftist ACLU-type judges legislating from the bench, who use judicial fiat to implement their stupid, failed Marxist ideas  &mdash;  I expect a lot more of same with an Obama presidency.  These types of judges are the ones who have the ultimate power to wreck havoc on our nation.</p>
<p>Who do you think Obama will nominate for the Supreme Court  &mdash;  an ACLU or NAACP-type judge?, or possibly a judge from the ranks of LaRaza.</p>
<p>The tragedy is, what Communists did during the &rsquo;30s, &rsquo;40s and &rsquo;50s amounts to 61 million dead in the Soviet Union and many millions more murdered in Cambodia, Communist China, and other Communist hell-holes.  This mean nothing to these people  &mdash;  and of course, these genocides are not mentioned in any high school text book that I&rsquo;ve encountered.  Che worship seems to be the new rage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM</a></p>
<p>American Marxists, such as Obama, have learned nothing from history.  They are so egotistical and short-sighted and unaware of human nature, that they believe THEIR exact Soviet policies won&rsquo;t create the same death and destruction as that brought about by Communists in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Yes, God help us all!</p>

<p><br>
Good point! Yes, I noticed how often blacks (especially black women) like to refer to themselves as exotic. As though there is something precious and rare about their darkness, when nothing could be farther from the truth. They also like to make it seem as though Whites are common looking when it is the exact opposite. A naturally blonde blue eyed Swedish girl is far more of a rarity than a dark skinned dark haired dark eyed Nigerian woman. So the Swedish woman is much more exotic.</p>

   Yes but without the White man&rsquo;s talent and intelligence to keep the modern economy running, when electricity and water runs out, bridges and buildings collapse and basically society returns to the stone age of Africa, blacks will start blaming White racism again. So Whites will never win. Let them accept that they will be called racists come what may. You either ignore it or wear it as a badge of honour. Once I was called racist by a black dude. I answered that I was too intelligent and well-informed to not be a racist. He just stared at me. He had not comeback.<br>

&#8220;You still have a <br>
core group of Americans who will not vote for him because of the color of his skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the same old mantra - and it points to the absolute shallowness of the people making the statement. What is scary is not the shallowness, but the corruption.  Meaning, they can not get past their shallowness and, so, convert this mantra into a truth. This in turn points to their immaturity. Their whole &#8220;Love him, Or else!&#8221; mentality. They are like a pre-teen in terms of development. If a child gets an idea in their head no amount of information will convince them otherwise. In one way this is understandable, it&rsquo;s a defense mechanism.  A child HAS to experience love because love is the highest value and life without a sense of value is pretty much intolerable for humans; insanity or suicide or violence seem to be the only options (which, obviously, is what they are trying to do with us, take away our sense of value). So they HAVE to believe they are worthy and that their parents (in this case Obama and the State) love them. </p>
<p>Conversely, they will use this shallow argument not only to support him but to defend him as well. He and his supporters will be placed above criticism* and on the most shallow grounds imaginable. And when the whole thing implodes, which, of course, it will, there will be NO accountability at all. In fact, the usual scapegoats will be trotted out on the stage and punished.<br>
*this will not be true of his White supporters who I believe will become scapegoats when the time is right (particularly those in his Cabinet). Perhaps this is the ONLY reason they are tolerating White supporters. Could this be the lesson they learned from the campaigns of Jackson and Sharpton?).</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it - Obama represents nothing less than the continuing digression, not progression, of the West.</p>
<p>It is the combination of a few factors I would like to outline if I may:</p>
<p>The Revolt of the Masses (see Ortega y Gasset&rsquo;s book by the same title)</p>
<p>The Slave Revolt in Morality (Nietzsche, see his On the Geneology of Morals)</p>
<p>The once gradual, now rapid, &ldquo;Dumbing of America&rdquo; that leads to one big over-simplified response to – everything. And with diminished intellect you have an increase in immature emotion.<br>
It also points to two other things; the victory of both the Culture of Arrested Development and the Culture of Sincere Denial, more commonly known as - Delusion.</p>
<p>These elements are coming together at the same time and Obama (though obviously hand-picked by THE REAL OWNERS OF THIS COUNTRY) is merely the Political Representation of this progressive disease (I guess in that sense they ARE &ldquo;Progressives&rdquo;). That his supporters don&rsquo;t see this is proof of how either gullible or dishonest they are. But also, more importantly, how THEY think ONLY in terms of the color of his skin. I mean, how disingenuous can you get? Why are they saying this is &ldquo;historic&rdquo;? Because of his Foreign Policy, or position on Immigration, or his Economic Platform? Folks they guys are just not emotionally sober, at all. In fact, the country is about to be run over by a bunch of emotional drunks. What concerns me about the Obamanation headed our way is the high concentration of Fanatical Codependents.</p>
<p>Either way - these elements are coming together as we speak whether Obama &#8220;wins&#8221; or not; and the manifestation of these elements will be &#8220;a Perfect Storm of Epic Proportions.&#8221; Maybe it will be the bottom we need to hit for any real change to happen.<br>

<p>I certainly hope you&rsquo;re right, but from the evidence we&rsquo;ve seen so far   &mdash;   of younger generations of whites supporting Obama in droves, and many white liberals in general doing the same   &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t see how you can conclude that Obama has no chance.  Though some or many whites are racially conscious, there are many who are not.  Let&rsquo;s not forget this is what&rsquo;s gotten us into all of our multi-cultural troubles in the first place.  I just don&rsquo;t see them all of a sudden deciding not to vote for the black man when they go into the voting booth.  Whites are responsible for propelling Obama into the national spotlight, and unless those same groups suddenly have a change of heart, I think it&rsquo;s going to be hard for McCain to beat Obama.</p>

<p>The people getting screwed are the White Democrats, especially women voters who make up several times the black vote.  Howard Dean and the DNC figured they best not upset the blacks by picking Clinton over Obama.  They figured these White voters would just fall in line after the dust settles.  They figured wrong!  Those so called black patriots you mentioned will undoubtedly vote for Obama this November so matter what they might say.  I say good riddance.

They have already set pubic expectation by incessantly evangelizing their &#8220;forever war&#8221; and they will likely engineer another &#8220;terrorist&#8221; attack just prior to the election to insure people will accept McCain the war monger as their new president.     </p>

<p>From everything I have seen, - massive youth support, strong White liberal support, virtually all Black support and let&rsquo;s not forget he is the media candidate,   &mdash;   it looks like it will very difficult for McCain to defeat him.</p>

			<p>I was in a sports bar last week. The bar was filled with young people. People under 35 I would say. They made up at least 90% of the bar.</p>
<p>When several of the commentators announced that Barack Obama was the democratic nominee for president the bar exploded. People were giving one another high fives, patting each other on the back, hugging on another, women were screaming, guys were yelling, some people even begun to dance as well.</p>
<p>The most depressing part about all this was that most of the young people were White. There were a nubmer of Black, Latino Asains in the bar too, but I would say that 70% of the young men and women were White. Nonetheless, they were all celebrating with one another.</p>
<p>This is what we will have to look forward to in November. Sad!   </p>

			<p>&#8220;Elections are as phony as those who run for public office. The shadow government will appoint whomever they chose to serve them. I don&rsquo;t believe that appointing a despised effeminate black Muslim racist for president is part of their agenda. They have already set pubic expectation by incessantly evangelizing their &ldquo;forever war&rdquo; and they will likely engineer another &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; attack just prior to the election to insure people will accept McCain the war monger as their new president.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sympathize with your point of view.  It&rsquo;s odd to me how someone like Obama, an unknown, can come out of nowhere to best Clinton political machine and end up relegating them to obscurity.  This whole thing looks like it was engineered to keep the Bush policies via McCain in play.  </p>

			<p> The cultural genocide against Whites is almost complete. With the help of the media and White race traitors. The White working class, wich has always been the backbone of this country has all but been eliminated.<br>
  Your&rsquo;e choices are between McCain who will continue to flood the country with Hispanics or Obama.<br>
  It will be almost impossible for the old, haggard and sickly looking John McCain to defeat the tall, youthful Obama.<br>
  The media has taught young Whites to worship Blacks through constant hero worship of Rap and Proffesional sports stars.</p>

			<p>Presidential elections are no different than WWF wrestling matches - scripted nonsense with a predetermined outcome.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for people who think we can vote our way out of this mess.</p>

<p>Keep telling yourself that but just remember Obama only got 1/3 of the White vote in the primaries.  In the minds of many White Americans, this election is already over with and November is just a formality.</p>

<p>The Whites who didn&rsquo;t vote for him were more massive than the flaky college students who did.  Strong White liberal support?  Not from the feminists who make up the bulk of the party voters.  If Clinton is not on the ticket, Obama can kiss them goodbye.  Maybe regardless of that.  They know they got a raw deal.  </p>

<p>I would like to think you are correct, but I think you two underestimate the powerful White elite who run this nation.</p>
<p>They will ensure that Barack Obama will defeat John McCain. It will be for their own selfish purposes, but they will do so.</p>

			<p>There is no Future for Whites:  For every one of those communist infested yuppie &#8220;sports bars&#8221; you mention there are hundreds of down home watering holes that blacks avoid like the plague and the patrons of those down home watering holes are the true representitives of white America&hellip;   </p>
