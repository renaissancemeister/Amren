						<p>Police arrested 70 Sikh protesters after the MTV music channel&rsquo;s office in western India was vandalized over posters showing a Sikh girl massaging a man, officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Monday, protesters smashed windows with rocks, tore banners and damaged furniture in the MTV office in Mumbai, India&rsquo;s financial and entertainment capital, police inspector Raju More said.</p>
<p>The protesters said the posters, which promoted the reality show &#8220;On the Job2,&#8221; offended Sikhs, More said. Sikhs comprise more than 2 percent of India&rsquo;s 1.1 billion people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maneshinde [Satish Maneshinde, MTV&rsquo;s attorney in Mumbai] said MTV would consider the protesters&rsquo; demands to remove the posters.<br>

<p>We&rsquo;re about half-way into the initial stages right now.  The next phase should warm things up a bit.</p>

			<p>What exactly does an obsession with adolescent homosexuality and race mixing with black males have to do with music? With the rise of India and China, maybe some of this third world immigration will be diverted away from the west.</p>

			<p>I used to be proud of American culture but it&rsquo;s become so degraded and trashy that I actually relish these kinds of stories. MTV back in the 80s was great when it showed music videos but now it&rsquo;s nothing more than a brainwashing factory with programming geared towards an agenda.  That Sikh woman messaging a man is actually quite tame compared to some of the stuff they&rsquo;d really like to shock the Indian public with like homoerotic interracial love. These are just baby steps right now.     </p>

			<p>If these silly Sihks think they are intolerant, just wait until the Muslims get control of India. India has more different religions and gods than any country I am familiar with, and the well known &#8220;religion of peace and tolerance&#8221; WILL NOT!!! tolerate other religions and have been know to deal with them rather ruthlessly. So, a previous poster is correct, it is going to get interesting.</p>

<p>MTV - the vile source of Summer Redstone&rsquo;s rise to US Media power is the worst, most vulgar, low down media network in Western history.</p>
<p>Go Sikhs. Use those swords the way they are met to be used.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t allow any more Adam Sandler stupid movies or (goes without saying) any rap hip hop music.</p>

			<p>I agree WR: MTV is one of the worst influences in American culture today. I was channel surfing the other day and paused on Tila Tequila&rsquo;s program only to see a young man walking barefoot on broken glass to remain<br>
in her stable. I grew  up watching MTV (headbanger&rsquo;s ball specifically) but the so called music channel&rsquo;s standards have just deteriorated so much over the past 10<br>
years, it simply embodies the worst of our increasingly vapid culture which relies on sexual imagery to sell everything.</p>

			<p>I do not see what the problem is? Indeed we must look up to these Sikhs for standing up against immorality. If Britons would have been doing this from the 60&rsquo;s and smashing up TV stations for their leftist propaganda, think what a nice place Britain would have been today. It is the genteel nature of westerners that the elites are taking advantage of.</p>

			<p>The Sikhs haven&rsquo;t really seen anything yet.  MTV is only an appetizer.  I propose a good dose of BETV as a second course, because when it comes to degrading young women, very little tops BETV, with the possible exception of prostitution, and a &#8220;Danny Glover charges in and saves everybody&#8221; movie as the main dish.</p>
<p>Spike Lee, who seems to think history is malleable, could direct a movie in which Ord Wingate, played by Danny Glover, overcomes a lifetime of racial prejudice by devising a daring scheme to use African soldiers to land behind Japanese lines in Burma during World War Two and resupply them by air, while the incompetant British, Gurkhas and Sikhs are getting their butts kicked at Imphal and Kohima.  The battles of Tennis Court and Administrative Box would have the British, Gurkhas and Sikhs break and run.  Wingate&rsquo;s own death in an accidental airplane crash could be suitably rewritten as well, with cars and trucks just jumping into the air and cavorting like 1980s-vintage Audis with grandma at the wheel because that&rsquo;s what they do when they catch fire.</p>
<p>Rudyard Kipling grew up in India, and his poem &#8220;The Grave of the Hundred Dead&#8221; was once posted here.</p>
<p>I also noticed that Sikh bodyguards had the stones to kill Indira Ghandi after the massacre at their Golden Temple (imagine if a foreign army of occupation had stormed and burned the Vatican; what would good Catholics do?)  While I don&rsquo;t really want to live with Sikhs, I admire acceptance of fate and bravery in any man.</p>

			<p>  I have to support the Sikhs on this one. MTV is a culturally degenerate, and harmful influence. It should have no place in India. If I was India, I would join the Sikh demonstrators in denouncing MTV.</p>

			<p>I fully support MTV.  There is nothing &#8220;immoral&#8221; about that network&rsquo;s programming   &mdash;   shallow at times perhaps, but not immoral.  And even if it were, who gave a bunch of revolting Third World radicals the right to smash someone else&rsquo;s property?  So much for property rights.</p>
<p>I detest religious fundamentalists of all kinds, and support rock n&rsquo; roll, Hollywood and other forms of cultural &#8220;pollution.&#8221;  If the Sikhs don&rsquo;t like what&rsquo;s on their TV sets, tough for them.  Let these wackos stick this one out.    </p>

			<p>Carl, I am an agnostic, not a religious fundamentalist.  But I can recognize moral pollution when I see it.  It is a mistake of the first order to assume that &#8220;morality&#8221; must be religious.  Societies that fail to have suitable standards of sexual and ethical behavior fall apart and are replaced by societies that do.  This is called natural selection.<br>

			<p>MTV went from &#8220;Music Television&#8221; to &#8220;Marxist Television&#8221; in a very short span of years.  There is nothing, and I mean nothing, the communists don&rsquo;t politicize into a vehicle of mass indoctrination.  Have you noticed how whites are increasingly being portrayed by the entertainment media as evil and incompetent, while portraying blacks as Saintly and adept?</p>
<p>And have you noticed increasing numbers of Mexicans, Muslims and East Indians appearing in our movies and television?  This is a pathetically transparent attempt by Hollywood Marxists to make whites accept these incompatible and unwanted aliens in our society and to give young people the false impression that these interlopers have always made up a large percentage of our population&hellip;<br>
