						<p>Racist violence and discrimination persist across the European Union, and most members of the 27-nation bloc aren&rsquo;t taking advantage of tough legislation to crack down on the scourge, the EU&rsquo;s rights agency warned Tuesday.</p>
<p>Britain and France lead a list of nine countries credited with actively fighting racism and xenophobia, but most other EU members aren&rsquo;t making the most of a tough EU-wide &#8220;racial equality directive,&#8221; the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights said in its annual report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From 2006-2007, Britain punished 95 offenders with sanctions &mdash; more than all of the other 26 member states combined &mdash; said the Vienna-based agency, which polices the EU in an effort to stamp out discrimination in employment, housing, education, health care and other key areas.</p>
<p>It also singled out Bulgaria, France, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Finland and Sweden for making good use of existing legal tools to fight discrimination.</p>
<p>By contrast, a dozen EU member states &mdash; the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia &mdash; issued no sanctions at all during the same period. &#8220;The absence of sanctions coincides in most cases with the absence of an effective equality body&#8221; to fight racism and discrimination, the rights agency said. It said the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Spain have no commission in place to deal with complaints.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The EU is struggling to get a full picture of racially motivated crime because 16 of its 27 members do not adequately record it, it added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must guarantee that equal rights and protection from discrimination and racism are a right in practice and not just on paper,&#8221; said Anastasia Crickley, who chairs the agency&rsquo;s management board.</p>

			<p>This is little to do with achieving &#8220;racial justice&#8221;, as the popular platitude has it. This &#8220;anti-discrimination&#8221; legislation is merely a way of enforcing indiscriminate farmyard-style &#8220;equality&#8221; in keeping with the desire to make the EU a European Soviet. Of course, this will be more effectively brought about with the demoralization and destruction of those pesky white people, so maybe it&rsquo;s not THAT &#8220;indiscriminate&#8221; after all &hellip;</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary to fight discrimination if they had not insisted on importing people who cause race riots, racial animosity, religious hatred, and who show a distinct affinity toward hatred of the native population.</p>
<p>How dimwitted are they that they can&rsquo;t see this?  Surely it is the multicults who push for such insanity, because they are mentally and emotionally disturbed, but for the neutrals in the government to go along with the idea that warm bodies of any kind are needed to compensate economically for low birth rates by increasing tax units, is even dumber.  Bringing flakes, oddballs and misfits who pull from the public treasurery do not benefit any country economically, but even if they did the amount of turmoil created by these people can&rsquo;t even remotely  justify having them there.</p>
<p>Britain is beset to a greater extent from government incompetents and multicult oddballs than even the US, which is a very close second when it comes to hare-brained idiots within the elitist sector.</p>

<p>No amount of legislation is going to help. The problem is europe has allowed millions of hostile, non-assimable aliens who don&rsquo;t want to and can&rsquo;t assimilate into european society. You can&rsquo;t mix oil and water. The only thing that will help is repatriation and a halt to immigration.</p>

			<p>  A typical AP story, in that the writer goes blithely on and on about &#8220;racism, discrimination,&#8221; ad nauseum, without ever really specifying just what actions are referred to, who the &#8220;victims&#8221; are, and who the &#8220;villains.&#8221; Of course, we all know that the EU diktat refers to White Europeans as the perpetrators, always and without exception. Presumably the &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221; is mostly committed by immigrant Muslims, although of course right-wing Europeans will get all the blame.</p>
<p> Once again our European cousins are reaping what they sowed by allowing these hordes of the darker races into their countries. Wasn&rsquo;t worth it, was it?</p>

			<p>The EU is not doing enough to stamp out mass immigration from the third world (especially of Muslims). Indeed, it is actively encouraging it.</p>
<p>There will be civil war in Europe soon.</p>

			<p>I know the EU isn&rsquo;t doing enough to stamp out racism! Look at how whites are getting killed in Zimbabwe or how the Chinese are discriminated in Malaysia or how the Jews and the Arabs keep fighing.  Oh, wait a minute!  They&rsquo;re talking about &#8220;racism&#8221; against non-whites.  I totally forgot that we&rsquo;re white and our rights don&rsquo;t count.  </p>

			<p>When are these fool politicians going to learn that you cannot &#8220;fight&#8221; racism because you cannot legislate people to embrace that which they do not want to embrace. If the people of Europe feel uncomfortable and culturally threatened by foreign invaders, then they have the right to resist. History tells us that in the 1580s, England didn&rsquo;t want to be Spanish Catholic. Non-German Europeans did not want to be German in the 1930s and 40s.  How is this 21st century invasion any different, except for the fact that governments have turned on their own people? The people didn&rsquo;t invite the invaders in. The Czech Republic is great example. Ever since they were Bohemian, the Czech have had a dislike for Roma (Gypsies) when the Roma came to their land. The Roma were not Bohemian, they did not speak the language, they did nothing to enrich the economy and native culture of Bohemia, they did not assimilate, and they were justifiably assocaited with theft and fraud. The Roma are still there and the Czech still do not like them, and understandably so.  Last time I was in Europe (March 2008), I saw no monuments welcoming tired, poor, huddled masses. The governments needs to leave the people alone. Talk about meddling in human rights!</p>

			<p>If you all were to go and read the actual article, it says nothing of Muslims, but discusses discrimination against gypsies. Of course, it&rsquo;s not like the gypsies haven&rsquo;t earned their reputation either. </p>

			<p>Europe is being overrun with Muslims and Europe&rsquo;s whites don&rsquo;t like it, however, Europe&rsquo;s politicians glorify Islamic invasion while demonizing those who oppose it by calling them racists.  As soon as Europe&rsquo;s whites wake up and realize that racism is a perfectly natural response to having hostile and incompatible aliens rammed down their throats their politicians will be disarmed.  Virtually everyone on the planet is a racist, because it is normal to favor ones own race over that of others&hellip;  </p>

			<p>How can this be? I thought racism and its attendant evils were the consequence fo the horrid crime of long ago slavery.<br>
But none of these European countries have ever had minority slaves. And none of thier Blacks and Muslims have ever been slaves there or anywhere else - except maybe back in their original homelands - slaves of each other.</p>

<p>Good points.  Isn&rsquo;t it odd that the multicults in Britain and France are the ones crying the loudest about bias against non-whites by whites, when it is the non-whites who torch 100 cars per night in a normal night, and isn&rsquo;t it they who have no go zones where no white dare enter, and isn&rsquo;t it they who are causing racial riots in both countries?</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t it Britain that has had the bombings which killed so many of their white citizens, and isn&rsquo;t it the same country that has numerous black on white attacks in every locale that has any significant number of non-whites?  </p>
<p>Chaos in both countries from non-white, anti-white hatred is at serious levels, yet nothing is ever written by their MSM or uttered by their government elites about the seriousness of the situation, calling for a halt to it.</p>
<p>Instead they ignore the real trouble and harp on white on non-white racism, which is so insignificant by comparison it doesn&rsquo;t even register.</p>
<p>These elites are the worst of the worst, and there&rsquo;s no doubt they&rsquo;re worse than the worst criminal elements in both countries.  We are watching the destruction of both Britain and France and the elitist fools are trying to direct the attention elsewhere.  Far less serious crimes at Nurenburg called for hanging. </p>
