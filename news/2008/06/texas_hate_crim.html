						<p>It&rsquo;s a long way from Jasper, Texas, to San Francisco, and it&rsquo;s been a decade since the small town gained fame for a reason no one wanted: the murder of a black man, who was chained behind a pickup truck by three white supremacists and dragged to a horrific death.</p>
<p>Despite time and distance, about 100 people were brought back to June 7, 1998, at a San Francisco theater Sunday during a remembrance for James Byrd Jr., the 49-year-old father of three who was killed 10 years ago this month. The event happened in San Francisco because its sponsor, the James Byrd Jr. Racism Oral History Project, is based in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Oral History Project, headed by Lani Silver, is a project of the Byrd Foundation for Racial Healing, which was founded by Byrd&rsquo;s family. Since it began in 2000, the oral history project has gathered more than 2,600 oral histories on racism in America, and has taught thousands of Bay Area students, in school programs, about racism. The foundation, which intends to stop hate through education, also gives scholarships and organizes cultural diversity workshops in Jasper, and has helped pass hate-crime legislation in Texas.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure this fact will be repeated many times here in this thread, but Byrd and his three assailants all knew each other because they served time in prison together.  This was a fight among ex-cons, and the whites just happened to yell out racial slurs, and Byrd was killed.  It wasn&rsquo;t a hate crime in the quintessential sense, but neither the SPLC or the Pro-Defamation League were to be confused by facts and went on to raise money based on the San Francisco mythology.</p>

<p>Thank-you Lani Silver for helping to keep hate alive. We wouldn&rsquo;t want people to move on with their lives when we can perpetuate old wounds. &#8216;Never forget&rsquo; I guess&hellip;</p>

			<p>What they don&rsquo;t tell you is that the dragging was a retaliation for rape.  They guy, John King, was gang raped while in prison.</p>
<p>King had no previous record of racism, he was a nonviolent offender, convicted of only of burglary, and he weighed only 140lbs.  Yet he was put in one of the toughest prisons in the country were he was repeated raped by black gangs.  He had joined a white-supremacist prison gang for self-protection.  Kings accomplices independently told the same story.</p>
<p>But the mainstream press is not about to let any mitigating facts get in the way of a good story.  Just like the Jena six distortions, the media has decided its about race so its about race; the facts be damned.</p>

<p>You can bet that not one of those 2,600 &#8220;oral histories on racism&#8221; was about anti-white racism. So, of course, it will increase racist violence by blacks against whites by giving them yet more reasons to hate us and blame us for thier failures in life.</p>
<p>Expect even more Missy McLauchlin&rsquo;s. Strange that there was no 10-year memorial for her lynching at the hands of racist blacks. Only the evil &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; at AR thought to remember her at all.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The guy John King was gang raped in prision&#8221;<br>
 Trouble is, the guy they killed didn`t rape him. If he had I would see it as TV Western justice. Instead, it was picking out a symbolic victim based on his skin color. Not too far from the MSM spin they put on things. He should have found the REAL perps, if they were out and given them The Field Marshal Rommel treatment.( In a quarter of an hour you`ll be dead&#8221;  and before you post, yes I know it wasn`t covered by the media if thats your point.</p>

			<p>Whites would never be allowed such an event to heal over the equally horrific murders of Channon Christian and Chrisopher Newsom. But then, many whites are blissfully unaware of them since the media saw fit to hide this crime from the American public, so as not stir up controvery. Of course, had the races of the victims and perps been reversed, they would have been lionized as martyrs and victims of white hate crimes, and their names would be mentioned for decades.</p>

			<p><i>Instead, it was picking out a symbolic victim based on his skin color.</i></p>
<p>No.  You are reciting the MSM line.  King didn&rsquo;t just pick out any black man.  King knew Byrd from prison.  It was likely very personal and based on some sort of revenge.  I&rsquo;m not defending the dragging death.  That is obviously a heinous thing to do.  But if the press is going to discuss this case repeatedly, they should be honest and discuss the case honestly.  King was raped in prison, he joined a white racial group for protection, and he sought revenge on a person he knew in prison.</p>
<p>My point is only that the MSM did every thing they could to make it 100% racial, when in fact it appears not to be.  I&rsquo;m not defending King or blaming Byrd, because I don&rsquo;t know the full story and thanks to the unreliable media, we will never get the full story.</p>
<p>I do know that when blacks congregate in prison, the press doesn&rsquo;t label them black supremacists.  When Latinos segregate along racial lines, the press doesn&rsquo;t label them Latino supremacist.  But when whites defend themselves along racial lines, the press invariably labels them white supremacists.</p>

			<p>Marisa Lagos displays poor journalism to say the least by not mentioning how Byrd had been gang raped by Blacks. It would not have justified Byrd&rsquo;s action, but it would contribute to the truth and knowledge of Black racism.</p>

			<p>If white America were made aware of the horrific magnitude of the crimes blacks commit against whites (VS the opposite) America&rsquo;s whites would howl in outrage and declare open season on blacks for their racist savagery and the MSM for their deliberate silence on the subject. It is ignorance of the facts that keeps whites docile, but the veils are being lifted and the truth will set us free&hellip;</p>

			<p>Hey Tim, blacks routinely use past &#8220;racism&#8221; as the excuse about why they killed a white person and they are excused by the media.  So, what gives?</p>

			<p>&#8220;The foundation intends to stop hate through education&#8221;,,,,</p>
<p>Maybe if they stopped black gang-rapes of Whites in prison that would be a more appropriate goal. The &#8220;hatred&#8221; came not from a &#8220;lack of education&#8221; but from very legitimate anger, loathing and revulsion of blacks because of their constant gang-rapes and sexual attacks of a young man who made one mistake and went to prison because of it. Rape is the most phychologically damaging and intrusive of all crimes and blacks commit more rapes then all other races added together. Had he been left alone in peace to just serve his sentence probably Bryd would be alive today. The depravity and vileness of black prison inmates was the TRUE cause of his death.</p>
