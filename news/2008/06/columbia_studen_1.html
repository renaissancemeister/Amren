<h1>Columbia Student Testifies in Rape Case As Suspect Refuses to Attend</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Ross and Corky Siemaszko, New York Daily News, June 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a quiet but steady voice, a former Columbia journalism student described Friday how a stranger invaded her Manhattan apartment and raped her repeatedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&rsquo;t hurt me! Please don&rsquo;t hurt me,&#8221; the young woman said she begged the man.</p>
<p>He threw her on the bed and tore off her clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;He started raping me,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;I thought he was going to kill me. I thought I was going to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she told her horrific tale, her frightened brown eyes darted over to the defense table where 31-year-old Robert Williams should have been sitting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dressed in a beige dress, she traced the outlines of her life before Assistant District Attorney Ann Prunty led her up to April 13, 2007 &mdash; the day her world was shattered forever.</p>
<p>Then 23, she said no alarm bells went off when she spotted the stranger in the elevator. She noticed he had a suitcase with rollers. But it was only after she got off &mdash; and heard the squeaking of the rollers &mdash; that she got nervous.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Prunty asked her if she tried to fight back, the young woman said she did &#8220;in the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to survive,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So I did what he told me to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victim testified for only an hour and will return to the stand on Monday.</p>

								<h2>Suspect In Rape of Columbia Student Refuses to Attend Trial</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Barbara Ross and Corky Siemaszko, New York Daily News, June 6, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The ex-con accused of raping and torturing a Columbia journalism student chickened out Friday and refused to show up for his trial.</p>
<p>Robert Williams&rsquo; decision spared the scarred young woman from having to confront the man who allegedly held her captive for 19 hours, tried to blind her with bleach &mdash; and carved up her face with a butcher knife.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Berkman [Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman] ordered the trial to continue and the victim, who was 23 when she was attacked on April 13, 2007, will take the stand this afternoon.</p>
<p>Her testimony comes a day after Prunty [Assistant District Attorney Ann Prunty] charged that Williams turned the victim&rsquo;s Hamilton Heights apartment into a &#8220;torture chamber.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an account that shocked listeners and forced a veteran sketch artist to flee in tears, Prunty told the court that Williams showed the victim no mercy and &#8220;proceeded to violate her in every way imaginable, and in some ways unimaginable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams, 31, gave no indication he was even listening as he sat beside Levine [Arnold Levine, counsel for the defense] &mdash; shackled to his seat. He is charged with 71 criminal counts, including attempted murder, arson, rape and sodomy. He faces life in prison.</p>
<p>The ordeal left the victim with a scarred face, severe burns, and liver damage from the over-the-counter pills she was forced to swallow by the fistfull.</p>
<p>Prunty said the woman was burned with bleach and later ordered to stab out her own eyes with scissors. When she couldn&rsquo;t do it, her attacker scalded her with boiling water, the prosecutor said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There were more horrors. She was forced to shear off her own hair &mdash; then her face was mutilated.</p>
<p>&#8220;He chose a butcher knife and slowly began to slice into her face and eyelids, carving and disfiguring her face,&#8221; Prunty said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before fleeing, the sadist tied her to a futon frame and set it on fire. But she used the flames to melt the computer cable cords binding her hands and feet &mdash; and escaped.</p>
