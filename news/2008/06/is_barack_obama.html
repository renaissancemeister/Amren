						<p>The 2000 U.S. Census was the first time Americans were allowed to identify themselves as &ldquo;multiracial,&rdquo; and more than six million people checked more than one box in the race and ethnicity category.</p>
<p>Included in the multiracial category is the Democratic presumptive nominee, Sen. Barack Obama. With a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya, Obama is the nation&rsquo;s first biracial candidate for president. The media, however, have continually called Obama the nation&rsquo;s first major party &ldquo;black candidate,&rdquo; saying he could make history as the first &ldquo;black president.&rdquo; But is that accurate?</p>
<p>A columnist examining Obama&lsquo;s background summed up his racial identity into one equation: white + black = black. </p>
<p>For me, that said it all.</p>
<p>There are some who point out Obama is just as white as he is black. He may be the nation&rsquo;s first black president, but he would also be the nation&rsquo;s 44th white president. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a white guy named Barack Hussein Obama,&rsquo; nobody&rsquo;s going to buy that,&rdquo; says cultural critic Michaela Angela Davis. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not ready for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is an issue that has sparked debate not only in our newsroom, but also among my friends and family. Most Americans see Obama as a black man, and he identifies himself as a black man. But there are some who will argue that by labeling Obama as a &ldquo;black candidate,&rdquo; we are all ignoring a vital and legitimate side of his life</p>

<p>&hellip; and there are some who say that, by breeding with a black man, Obama&rsquo;s mother ignored a vital and legitimate side of HER life.  Any white who cohabits with a black knows that their offspring will be considered black or, at best, &#8220;biracial&#8221;.  Therefore, by miscogenating, she willfully discards her white heritage.</p>

			<p>White+Black=Non-White </p>
<p>And I will never vote for a non-white, as I stated to a pollster who questioned me on the topic.</p>
<p>This leaves aside Obama&rsquo;s own strivings to be &#8220;authentically black,&#8221; which have made led him to keep some odd company, including his nagger of a wife. And which led to Obama&rsquo;s odd statement identifying his maternal grandmother (the only one he knew, not coincidentally) as, &#8220;a typical white&#8221; on account of her expressed fear of lurking black males.</p>

			<p>Show me someone eager to be seen as biracial, and I will show you someone who is half of one non-white race and half of another non-white race.  I went to school with a number of Asians who had were half white.  I can understand why those abandoned by G.I. fathers to basically starve in impoverished countries could be rather bitter about that or angry that he wanted to suddenly be their dad after they were grown.  But if these men were something other than white, did their legally adult children want to check his race as well when asked for their own race?  You betcha!     </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an example of Obama, in his own words, describing his thoughts on whites and how he feels about his &#8220;biracial&#8221; identity.</p>
<p>To be blunt, Obama is BLACK.  He thoroughly and aggressively rejects any hint of white identity and despises whites.  He&rsquo;s been lying about this for quite some time, in order to advance himself as a politician.  However, it&rsquo;s for a sinister end.  He intends whites HARM if we are stupid enough to elect him President.  He has been actively harmful to white interests during his entire Senate career.</p>
<p>Luckily, he is being outed as the vile bigot that he is.  Although the traitors who run our MSM are working overtime to put lipstick on this pig, there is simply too much to keep the real Barack Obama from becoming widely known about.</p>
<p>I actually find quite alot to like about this guy.  By being so, sooooo bad.  And covering up and then getting caught, he is bringing these issues into wide public awareness.</p>
<p>Many whites are learning the truth about liberalism and about where blacks are REALLY coming from politically.  If we are very lucky, enough damage will be done to finally break liberalism&rsquo;s hold on our country.  Enough people will know the truth that they will start seeing all the intense manipulation going on in the media in all its forms&hellip;&hellip;and vigorously reject it.</p>

			<p>  Let&rsquo;s face it: Historically, in America, if you&rsquo;ve got one drop of black blood, you&rsquo;re black. In the days of slavery, that&rsquo;s the way slaveholders wanted it; on the other hand, blacks who were light enough tried to &#8220;pass for White.&#8221;</p>
<p>  In this day and age, blacks are more apt to call themselves &#8220;black&#8221; even if they have one White parent   &mdash;   or even just one black grandparent. It&rsquo;s an easy way to qualify for all the affirmative action goodies, if you can pull it off. And if Barack Hussein Obama is to be considered &#8220;half-White&#8221; as this mixed-race group says, why is it always the black half of his heritage that he stresses? He didn&rsquo;t join his White grandmother&rsquo;s church, did he? But then, she was &#8220;just a typical White person.&#8221;</p>

<p>And for good reason. This is a &#8220;person&#8221; who has openly denounced his white family (the one who raised and took care of him) while embracing his black side (the one that ran off on him) Well folks, from his attitude and his mental problems, he is most definetly 100% black.</p>

			<p>Amazing how this man rejects the side of his family who loved and took care of him and only identifies with and is proud of the side of his family that abandoned him and his mother.  Says a lot about his/blacks values, doesn&rsquo;t it.  Then consider that by identifying as black only Obomination gets the government AA handups that he wouldn&rsquo;t get as a White man.  The fact that he&rsquo;s taken advantage of that his whole life says a lot about his/blacks morals, doesn&rsquo;t it.</p>

<p>When they talk about him as &#8220;African-American&#8221; and McCain as &#8220;white&#8221; there is a problem.  McCain is 100% European American, Obama is 50% European American and 50% African American.  It is a problem.</p>

<p>Obama&rsquo;s mother was a Red hippie whore + his father was a Red Muslim pimp, which = a Red of many parallax hues that are intersecting at points of common hatred and genocidal intent for the white race in the USA, defined as Barack Obama.  </p>

			<p>Yes, Obama is black.  But, he owes any ability, though quite mediocre, to his white heritage, just like Douglas, Dubois, Malcolm X, Jeremiah Wright, Carl Rowan, Brian Gumbal, on and on and on.</p>
<p>It has been the infusion of white blood into the black race that has raised their questionable group I.Q. average to 85, while Africa remains at about 70.</p>
<p>These pitiful, tortured people should do everything in their power to have a couple of states in the US as their own, or they should fight equally as hard to secure a homeland in Africa.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t be integrated with whites or any other race.  They should have their own country to destroy all by themselves.  The sooner they have their own enclave, the sooner they can begin destroying it and making it uninhabitable.  And the sooner they do that the sooner they can begin receiving CARE packages from white Americans.</p>

<p>I disagree.  Obama is a white guy (mostly white genetically, all white ethnically and culturally) who realized early on that his black admixture represented an easy way to capitalize on the gifts of his white admixture (brains).  He&rsquo;s a white guy who&rsquo;s cashing in on the advantages of black admixture (immunity from criticism, race card, victim status, &#8220;white guilt&#8221; mongering, etc).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s tried so very hard to be politically black, because he knew his white admixture, his white ethnicity and culture, would require him to be holier than thou to be accepted by blacks.  That&rsquo;s why he sought out Trinity church, with its militant blackness (&#8220;liberation theology&#8221;) and angry high yella pastor (who better to teach him how to be blacker than thou?).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a perfectly logical calculation; who ever got anywhere by being politically white?  Sure, the attributes (brains) of whiteness are an advantage, but working for or appealing to white interests?  Don&rsquo;t make me laugh.  You get points for <i>trashing</i> those things in America today.</p>

			<p>All bi-racial people (black/white) gravitate towards the &#8216;black&rsquo; side of their gene pool.</p>
<p>Halle Berry, Alicia Keyes are just a couple of the famous ones that come to mind at the moment.  I see it all the time in real life.</p>
<p>It is always, without exception, the white side of the family who has raised, nurtured, nursed, educated, and loved.  They shed blood, sweat, and tears on behalf of the child.  The black side of the family contributes little or nothing.</p>
<p>I have seen this happen so many times I could cry.  It is incomprehensible that the white side of these families always suffer the ultimate rejection.</p>
<p>But consider it fair warning.  If you dare to raise a black/biracial child, it will all come to naught. Your efforts will never be appreciated.  You are a means to an end.<br>
No good deed goes unpunished.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that many will disagree with me.  I&rsquo;m just basing my opinion on what I&rsquo;ve seen time and time again.  And I am glad that I&rsquo;ve had the good sense to never personally experience it. </p>

			<p>Although I see the point many are making with the one-drop references and the genetic dilution-factor. However, Obama is still half White! Thus, for all this fuss and gushing about this &#8220;great black hope&#8221; &hellip;well, he really isn&rsquo;t that is he? At least not entirely. The media is clearly obsessed with his non-whiteness, as are many of his black followers. What ever happened to all that clap-trap about blacks feeling &#8216;ol Obama wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;black enough?&#8221;    </p>

			<p>A gasoline powered car and electric car are two different technologies, one large, noisy and powerful, the other weak but quiet, yet when both forms merge into one they become a hybrid. Same with a sleek road bicycle sporting thin tires and a mountain bike with knobby tires and a heavy-duty frame and rims; the result: a medium-weight bicycle halfway between the two, fit for road and trail use, again called a hybrid. Same goes with wolf-coyote crosses, bison-cattle crosses, and the like, neither quite like their parent forms, but some sort of middle-of-the-road combination of the two.<br>
Therefore we should stop labeling Obama the first viable black candidate and dub him instead the first viable hybrid candidate.</p>

			<p>This is in reply to the person who asked at 12:00 a.m. whether we would accept a mulatto who identified as white.  If you are so certain that your question is so clever, you should have posted your name.  You hide your identity because your question is silly.  </p>
<p>I can tell you why I would accept &#8220;mulattos&#8221; who appeared to be white as white.  I would never know that they weren&rsquo;t white unless they made a point of being non-white, but they always do.  Someone who could pass for maybe Italian or something is very eager to tell me which non-white entitlement group they belong to.</p>
<p>Barack is not white and not really black either, but he has learned to play racial politics well enough that the media and many voters don&rsquo;t even notice that he doesn&rsquo;t even have a platform on how to serve this country.  My friend is right when she says that Barack doesn&rsquo;t want to serve this country and that Barack just wants this country to serve him.     </p>

			<p>Ginny, why are you being so defensive at an honest question?  I&rsquo;m not a troll, and I wasn&rsquo;t trying to be a smart-alek, but your hostile response speaks volumes about your hypocrisy.  You know very well that, on average, you wouldn&rsquo;t have a hard time identifying a mulatto, so quit being evasive and just answer the question.  We&rsquo;re talking about well-known public figures who are mulattos, such as Obama and Halle Berry.  Not mulattos who are deceptively white.</p>
<p>And, with respect to a mulatto who can pass for white, has it ever occurred to you that perhaps he might inform you of his black heritage just as a matter of honesty and full disclosure?  After all, would you want your son or daughter marrying a white who wasn&rsquo;t the real McCoy?</p>

<p>During the eighteenth and nineteenth century, a number of states in the south (and north)passed laws the one drop rule stating that if a person had one drop of Black blood in them, they were Black. It almost passed at the federal level as well.</p>

			<p>Barak was raised and educated by whites grandparents. As a conseequence, the diference between him and his wife is that he probably does not hates  the white population. His mother was a very gifted white woman (the process  of recruitment of leftists in the sixties, all over the world, allways looked for very gifted people; I know this by experience)  His father belonged to the black elite of Kenya. The smartest 1% . As a result he is very smart. A genius among the blacks.  <br>
If he was a Brazilian, one or two hundred yeas ago, he would choose to be white. Being an american mullato his  choise was to be black. And it was a smart choise&hellip;<br>

			<p>Oh, Obama has a platform, you can be assured of that. His problem is that he dares not reveal his platform for it is completely marxist. But what he has revealed by what he tried to get passed in the Senate is enough to tell the story. It is not his mullatto-ness that is the danger, it is his marxism and hatred towards whites. He views whites as hosts for his parasitic schemes, including his Global Poverty Act. Mc Cain is certainly no conservative, but he is much better than this clown.</p>

			<p>Obama has admitted to frequently using drugs. If a school teacher or military officer did the same, they&rsquo;d be fired or kicked out of the service. As the son of a foreign national, he doesn&rsquo;t even qualify for a Top Secret security clearance, since he could claim Kenyan citizenship if he wanted. How can he even be considered for president?</p>

			<p>&#8220;All bi-racial people (black/white) gravitate towards the &lsquo;black&rsquo; side of their gene pool.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not true in my experience. Many black/white biracials I meet nowadays are culturally totally white and run in white social circles. This is even more likely the case when the biracial has a phenotype that leans more towards white than black.</p>

If Obama started identifying himself as White would you mistake him for being White?  No.  This is just some stupid anti argument about race being a social construct.  And stop denigrating Italians because we don&rsquo;t look anything like mulattos! </p>

			<p>Barack has chosen to emphasize his black heritage over his white.  His autobiographies, his church, his rhetoric all point to his black heritage.  He has self-selected to be black and emphasized this until he started this run for President.  It is easy to see that he was angst ridden, over who his father was, this angst does not bode well for how he would deal with situations that would deal with disputes between the differing sides of his heritage.  Such as the inherent discrimination of Affirmative Action, or the emphasis today on the evils of Western civilization, without noting the civilization portion or the contrast of Western civilization to other societies.  I think Western Civ stands up pretty well compared to others; we&rsquo;ve welcomed the other, as long as they will act like us.  It is seen as perfectly fine for non-whites to prefer their people, but evil for us to.</p>
<p>I want a President who has moved beyond his teenage angst, given Obama&rsquo;s comments whenever he&rsquo;s confronted with those issues, he doesn&rsquo;t appear to have successfully done so.  The self-absorption of anyone in their mid-40s who has written two autobiographies isn&rsquo;t someone who can look at a big picture, or at circumstances in anyway objectively.  Being an angst ridden community organizer, is quite different than being the putative leader &#8220;of the free world.&#8221;  </p>

			<p>&#8220;As someone who has posted a few times on this site, I notice that whenever a Black, Latino, other non-White or White liberal poster makes a comment, you are not far behind like speed racer -always quick to post a comment asking questions or challenging the poster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nice of you to notice. Do you believe that non-whites ought not to be challenged, despite the almost invariable stupidity of what they say? How often do you notice black, &#8220;latino,&#8221; non-white or white liberal posters responding with relevant facts? Very rarely.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;During the eighteenth and nineteenth century, a number of states in the south (and north)passed laws the one drop rule stating that if a person had one drop of Black blood in them, they were Black. It almost passed at the federal level as well.</p>
<p>As someone who prides themselves as an unqualified &ldquo;know it all&rdquo; you should know this!&#8221;</p>
<p>Completely beside the point. You mentioned &#8220;the racist laws of this nation.&#8221; That means FEDERAL law, and I defy you to demonstrate any federal statute of any era dealing with who is and who is not black. You ought to consider your claims more carefully before you make them.</p>

			<p> Mendelian inheritance, genes are passed on seperately in mixed offspring. They will always tend toward the dominant type[black in this case].<br>
   It is a misconception that mixes between very different parents will result in some kind of smoothly blended, best of both worlds &#8220;hybrid&#8221;. Thats not how genetics works.<br>
   Both types continue to exist in the mixed child and the offspring will tend toward the dominant type, wich is the more generalized, less specialized type.<br>
  White traits are recessive, so they breed out when mixed with darker traits.</p>

			<p>A black-white mixture is neither white nor black, he is a hybrid mixture. I am confounded by this idea that a biracial person can be &#8220;both&#8221; white and black. For someone to be black or white means that (by definition) they are overwhelmingly of one racial background. Blue + Yellow = Green, not &#8220;Blue-and-yellow&#8221;.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, there are people that I thought were black, but I wouldn&rsquo;t swear to it.  Other black people were also uncertain as to whether these same people were black or not.  One of my black co-workers even asked one such person straight out &#8220;What are you?&#8221;  She was Hispanic.  </p>

			<p>Barack Hussein is a good example of not just the racial poisoning of our European Heritage, but its glorification as well.</p>
<p>Anytime a black and a white breed with each other, we are left with a genetic gain for the black side, and the opposite for the white, since the black has become more visually agreeable.</p>
<p>Rather than look upon the mulatto as a genetic abnormality, we (ignorant whites) have come to see this as the &#8216;ideal&rsquo; in blacks. Consequently, those whites never or rarely exposed to blacks (i.e. Iowa, Washington, Minnesota, et al) see the mulatto and, in the case of BHO, his election, as a gain for us, our history, culture, and people. Nothing could be farther from the truth, as we know. </p>
<p>I only wish these dumb white sheep could live in a place like Atlanta or DC, and then tell us how much they like &#8216;diversity.&rsquo;  </p>

			<p>&#8220;While I agree with much that is said on this site, I do have an honest question for all the people who complain about mulattos who choose to identify with their black side over their white side: If a mulatto identified with his white side over his black side, would you accept him as white?&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by at 12:00 AM on June 11 </p>
<p>Ofcourse not.</p>
<p>I think the mulattos and other darkskins are a little smarter than they get credit for.  They don&rsquo;t identify with Whites because they can look in the mirror and see that they are brown.  Ever notice how the &#8220;pass for white&#8221; class gravitates more towards Whites?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m civil to a number of non-Whites for political reasons myself.  Obama is civil to a great deal of Whites for probably similar reasons.</p>
<p>When the illsuion of tolerance is no longer profitable to maintain, I, Obama, and many other people will stop being civil.  </p>
<p>Calling Obama half-White is just a part of the tolerance game.  Brown is not white anymore than mixed race is as intelligent as European.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s White grandparents and Mother were hard core leftists, basically communists. Anne Dunham, Obama&rsquo;s Mother was one of the white american leftist girls sent to prostilyze the third world foreign students in American colleges.</p>
<p>Probably the most successful was a communist gal named Janet Rosenberg.  She seduced and married a man of ethnic Indian descent from a tiny little S. American known as British guinea.  His name was Cheddi Jagan.  They met at a Northwestern Universtiy Evanston ILL foreign student gathering.  He married Janet and became a communist.  He later became president of guinea. This was very common in the 1950&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, commie American girls converting foreign students to communisn.</p>
<p>Anne Dunham was one of thousands of commie raised girls buzzing around the third world students.  Her parents were hard, hard core leftists.  They raised Obama from age 10 to college.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame Islam and black political pimp preachers for everything wrong with Obama.  The American communists and front group members have succeeded.  Their plan was to have enough of these half American, half non whites around to bring about their revolution.</p>
<p>There was an even bigger program getting whtie commie girls together with American black men to convert the American blacks to communism and raise the kids to bring about a revolution.  The infamous commie attorney Lynn Stewart was one of those girls.</p>
<p>Obama is a product of a long term communist plan made in the 1940&rsquo;s.  Must be a hundred thousand people born of those marriages, but they finally got what they wanted: a minority commie to destroy America</p>

<p>That is how his communist Mother and White grandparents raised him.  They were hard core lefties who hated America, worshipped Stalin and Lenin, and hated Whites.</p>

			<p>An interesting point about this issue that Rev Sharpton of all people made a big stink about initially and is now real quiet about is that Obama is in no way, shape or form, an AFRICAN AMERICAN.  He&rsquo;s half white, yes.  But his other half is Kenyan.  His ancestors NEVER experienced slavery nor second class citizenship in any manner.  He has no moral authority to evoke those themes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, damn few african americans know this.</p>

			<p>To Comrade Jamella and in defense of Cassiodorus:</p>
<p>It is all well and good for you to backtrack and type out your response that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the eighteenth and nineteenth century, a number of states in the south (and north)passed laws the one drop rule stating that if a person had one drop of Black blood in them, they were Black. It almost passed at the federal level as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But you could have easily avoided this by being more thoughtful with your original statement and having it read: &lsquo;Given the past racist laws of this nation, any person with one drop of Black blood is considered Black,&rsquo; in the first place. You did not do this, thus you opened yourself up to Cassiodorus&rsquo; more than reasonable question, because you wrote a comment that was present-day in tone. Moreover, instead of simply explaining your mistake, you exacerbate the problem by taking on an obnoxious tenor and posturing as if you were the injured party.</p>
<p>While this is a common tactic of &ldquo;Black, Latino, other non-White or White liberal&rdquo; posters who frequent this website, it is one that you should have also noted doesn&rsquo;t work here either. It was your sloppiness of thought and writing that caused this rebuttal by Cassiodorus to your post, not his speed raceresque and &ldquo;unqualified &lsquo;know it all&rsquo;&rdquo; stances.</p>
<p>If anything, I think you owe him an apology!</p>

			<p>According to MSNBC&rsquo;s mighty mouth, Chris Matthews (&#8220;Hardball,&#8221; June 11): &#8220;We&rsquo;re all the same race, just different ethnicities.&#8221;  Obviously, Matthews&rsquo; head will fit into a dark, hairy crevice.  I&rsquo;m not sure Obama&rsquo;s ears will permit him to make a similar insertion, but I am certain he has attempted it.  After all, he has chosen to embrace his blackness above his whiteness, though admittedly, his features will insure that others identify him as &#8220;black&#8221;. </p>
<p>I agree with Patrick (8:40 PM, June 10):  &#8220;When they talk about him as &#8220;African-American&#8221; and McCain as &#8220;white&#8221; we have a problem.&#8221;  With the media constantly drilling it into our heads that we are mere &#8220;whites,&#8221; while black people are distinguished as &#8220;African-Americans,&#8221; it is a problem.  It&rsquo;s especially disturbing to contemplate the subliminal damage being done to the perceptions of European-American children.</p>

<p>      Or to put it another way. If you take a gallon can of black paint, and mix it with a gallon can of white paint, you get black paint. Why? BECAUSE SCIENCE IS THE MOTHER OF NATURE!</p>
<p>      And since we humans exist as a whole, emotionally, spiritualy and mentaly, along with the physical, whites should stay away from any level of interaction or intergration with blacks-or they run the risk of being ruined.</p>
<p>     White paint, (or white people,) is superior only if it is not tainted with black paint. This is one of the main reasons why why whites leave there neighborhoods when blacks begin to move in-they feel threatened by that black paint.</p>
<p>     So were really talking about the &#8220;science of nature&#8221;, in being the determining factor regarding race. </p>

<p>Yet you&rsquo;ve never pointed out a single error of fact or logic in one of these &#8220;rants.&#8221; Like most &#8220;opposition&#8221; posters you don&rsquo;t seem to be able to make basic distinctions between fact and opinion. What difference should it make to anyone that you can attach a label  &mdash;  &#8220;mean-spirited,&#8221; &#8220;bigoted&#8221;  &mdash;  to something? If what I said was wrong, the error ought to be easy to point out. Yet in three posts and two responses you have failed completely to address a very simple point of fact. That you respond with this kind of childishness tells me all I need to know about you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although such behavior should hardly be surprising from someone who makes crass jokes about people who participate in the special olympics as you did on another post.&#8221;</p>
<p>The joke was at the expense of graduates of &#8220;historically black colleges,&#8221; as ought to have been obvious to even the meanest intelligence, although that seems to have been lost on you. Perhaps you attended Morehouse or Howard. In any case I will grant that the comparison in question was unfair to Special Olympians and something of a compliment to HBC alums.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re quite right about the &#8220;present tense&#8221; nature of the original assertion. That B.

			<p>Barack Hussein Obama (note how the media downplays his middle name with its Muslim connotation) is to politics what Tiger Woods is to golf.  Woods is also a mixed-blood.  But if a person has 1/4 black genes, he or she is considered to be &#8220;black&#8221; by the media and very often a lot of blacks themselves, especially if the person has accomplished something of note.</p>
<p>Guess Obama&rsquo;s mother learned the hard way that she should have not changed her mind about blacks.  Like so many black fathers, once a child is born they take off, not wanting the responsibility of having to support a family.  What else is new here?  Typical black behavior.</p>

<p>Yes it certainly is a problem - a serious one.  But it&rsquo;s not just coming from the media. It&rsquo;s an ideal well entrenched and established all throughout our government - you see it in the labor laws and social security laws, on Census forms, Personnel forms, etc. I still use and say the term - Blacks. I still remember the impassioned pleas and outright hostile demands for respect that the colored people made throughout this country - they wanted to be called black. My change of thought and talk was my choice - as an act of respect. But don&rsquo;t play me for a sucker!</p>

<p>I know this is in part due to the media, but Obama has definitely not asked the media to move past the race discussion. If he were truly interested in making change in this country, he would stick to discussing the type of change and good he hopes to bring for our nation.<br>

			<p>By keeping with the &#8220;One-Drop rule&#8221; you are all agreeing with a concept of slavery. It seems just as simple as yellow and blue make green, not blue because it&rsquo;s darker. You mix two ethnicities and you get something different than either parent. When someone is Italian/Irish they don&rsquo;t just say they are Italian because the Italian parent may be darker. I can just imagine how that came about in the first place. A slave owner is making white babies with his female slaves and his wife wonders why all of her babies are white and look like him. Of course the white bastard is going to say they are just black.</p>
