<h1><a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/20725264.html?location_refer=Homepage:highlightModules:2">2 Henry High Honor Students Are Now 2 Rape Suspects</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Davud Chanen, Star Tribune (Minneapolis), June 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The day Minneapolis Henry High School student Santwoine Thornton was charged with raping another student during school hours last week, he was to be honored as a college scholarship winner.</p>
<p>An honor roll student, Thornton wrote last month in the school&rsquo;s online newspaper that he planned to attend Minneapolis Community and Technical College to major in urban park, recreation and youth development. He boasted he proved people wrong who believed he would be dead or in jail by the time he was 18.</p>
<p>Police say Thornton, 17, of Minneapolis and Henry student Raevon Conner, 18, of Brooklyn Park may be responsible for at least four sexual assaults at the school in May and June. Conner, who was charged with raping a different student, was an honor student, a football player and a member of the school&rsquo;s championship poetry slam team.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kociemba [Henry Principal Gary Kociemba] said that the school didn&rsquo;t know about the assaults &#8220;until it was too late.&#8221; A 15-year-old victim came to school officials June 4, the day she was allegedly assaulted by Conner. Further interviews by police turned up Thornton as a second suspect, as well as three more victims assaulted in May and June.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conner and Thornton worked in tandem, seeking a victim and luring her to an isolated stairwell in the school, police said. Once there, authorities said, they took turns forcing the girl to perform oral sex and acting as a lookout. They knew where surveillance cameras were, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;I have changed for better&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his letter for Henry&rsquo;s online newspaper, Thornton said, &#8220;I was one of those kids you would look at and shake your head no. Thoughts would run through your mind like he will be dead or in jail by the time he&rsquo;s 18.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am proud to say I am a couple of months away from my 18th birthday and I have experienced neither,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;I was that troublemaker, that fight starter, but I have changed for the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thornton said a staff member asked him to write the letter because a couple of years ago he predicted Thornton would be on a list of kids who wouldn&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The staff member wrote that Thornton was an avid reader who is rarely without a good book in hand. He was also nominated to be Henry&rsquo;s &#8220;most talkative&#8221; senior by the students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conner was an honor roll student who played running back and defensive back on the football team his junior year. In 2006, he was a member of the school&rsquo;s championship poetry slam team.</p>
<p>Neither Conner nor Thornton has a criminal history. Both are well-liked by their classmates and teachers, said Bobby Gibson, a recent Henry graduate who said he&rsquo;s known Conner since the eighth grade. But Monday he recalled Conner asking him to be a &#8220;lookout&#8221; one day at a little-used area of the high school.</p>
<p>Gibson said no without asking why.</p>

			<p>1. A scholarship to attend a community college.<br>
2. A major in &#8220;urban park, recreation, and youth development&#8221;, which means teaching basketball to other Blacks, on a government salary.<br>
3. Poetry slam team.  (Rapping?)<br>
4. Nominated &#8220;Most talkative&#8221;.</p>
<p>     It sounds Black, all right, but not like any honor students I know.</p>

			<p>An honor student majoring in   &mdash;   organic chemistry? Quantum mechanics? Nuclear physics? No, let&rsquo;s try urban park, recreation and youth development. And just what is the &#8220;poetry slam team&#8221;?</p>
<p>Maybe we should all get bumper stickers that read, &#8220;My child was an honor student at Patrick Henry High.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a high school teacher and I see these types wandering through our education system constantly. They are incapable of understanding anything past the elementary school level,spend their time disrupting classes, travel in packs, are always vaguely threatening, and instantly aggressive towards students AND staff if they don&rsquo;t get their way. The media would have us believe that their primitive behaviour is due to white racism, but the truth is their behaviour is just typical of Africans in general. </p>

			<p>Every time you ever see a mug shot of one of these black thugs its always the same. That blank vacant stare, eyes as lifeless as a zombie. How anyone can still doubt that there are real genetic differences in the races including intelligence and morality is just completely beyond me. Liberal denial is incredible.</p>

			<p>Hell, my mother noted in 1967 (!) that Patrick Henry High School in Mpls., was NO PLACE for a white boy like myself to attend, in order to either a) stay alive or b) be &#8216;multiculturalized&rsquo; out of his own cultural heritage. So, with parents above the norm in age and viability in career, we left North Mpls.</p>
<p>We moved so far out into the sticks, there was a barn across the street from where we went. (New Hope!) Our &#8216;inner city relatives&rsquo; said that we were crazy to move so far out, that they wouldn&rsquo;t visit us, that &#8216;there&rsquo;s no hope for New Hope,&rsquo; and then, not fifteen years later, were lamenting that their neighborhood had, amazingly, &#8216;all gone black.&rsquo; My poor uncle died in abject fear that he was going to be mugged, attacked, etc. because the neighborhood had changed. (and he was 6&rsquo;2,&#8221; and a stocky Irishman!)</p>
<p>Now, the same ethnic mix that my amazingly prescient mother sought to rescue us from, is encroaching on that &#8216;suburban&rsquo; town we once moved to. The 281 School district is no longer on the high end of academic achievement, and the &#8216;exhorbitant&rsquo; price for a house we paid back then ($21,900) to live west of the cities, now finds that the same area is on the &#8216;low&rsquo; end of homes in &#8216;safe&rsquo; neighborhoods,&rsquo; where race-conscious whites have ALWAYS wanted to live. </p>
<p>Just as the article on the subprime crisis, being one of catering to minorities (that should not have been given the privilege of home ownership because they can&rsquo;t keep it, or even understand it) so, too, the ability to say, &#8220;I want to live with my own, in my own neighborhoods, away from non-whites, crime, vandalism, and stupidity,&#8221; should be enshrined as a constitutional right once more, and such sub-standard specimens of a specious &#8216;humanity&rsquo; be kept at bay from decent, moral Whites.</p>
<p>End of story. Except to say, thanks, Mom, for seeing the menace for what it was, and still is.</p>

			<p>The comments here are terribly disturbing. <br>
If those two young men actually did those crimes then they should be punished by the law. <br>
However, there are many other outstanding young men that fit similar descriptions and the comments here make it clear that regardless of how hard they try they will be prejudiced against, oppressed and held down by many in our society.</p>
<p>If you all are supposed to be a part of the &#8220;American Renaissance&#8221; then I hope it never comes about.</p>

			<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the reporter tell us the GPA&rsquo;s of these &#8220;honor students&#8221;?  Why haven&rsquo;t we heard about their A+ grades, high SAT scores, success in Calculus, etc?  </p>
<p>My guess is that like many inner city &#8220;youths&#8221;, they&rsquo;ve been <i>declared</i> honor student because they doesn&rsquo;t regularly skip school and they turn in homework sometimes.  The standard for &#8220;honor student&#8221; in articles like this is simply that a sympathetic teacher or family member <i>says</i> the thug&rsquo;s an honor student.  NOTE:  The scholarship he got was race-based, not academic-based.  </p>
<p>I read an article a few years ago where an &#8220;honor student&#8221; was in juvenile court being sentenced for assault and theft.  The yoof&rsquo;s attorney asked the judge for lenience due to the his supposed scholastic achievements, and judge actually asked to see the kids transcript.  Turns out he had a &#8220;D&#8221; average and typically failed 3 to 4 classes a semester!  </p>

			<p>Yes north Minneapolis is now a black ghetto. Black ghetto is moving out north by northwest from Minneapolis: Robbinsdale, Crystal, Brooklyn Center, Brooklyn Park. The first random black &#8216;pack attacks&rsquo; recently took place in Coon Rapids. All of this courtesy of Section 8 and idiotic DFL welfare policies.</p>

			<p>Of course high T-level and low IQ had nothing to do with it? With rampant grade inflation, don&rsquo;t believe for a moment that they really deserve to be called honor students. In Minneapolis Henry High School today if you want a diploma, go to rest room stall and pull one off the wall.</p>

			<p>  Can we really believe that these two are &#8220;honor students.&#8221;<br>
They could be exhibit A for a dumbed down multi-cultural curriculum. I have to wonder what high school classes they actually took, and just what is a &#8220;poetry slam team&#8221;?<br>

<p>My thoughts exactly QD.  This is one of the students blacks would want in a white gifted class, and when he failed to keep up they would be protesting it as racism, because he was an &#8220;honor&#8221; student.  Experience tells most of us that a black honor student is one that is on a par with a slow white, and I don&rsquo;t mean that facetiously.</p>
<p>Too, even in mixed schools the trend is to applaud blacks who have I.Q. scores in the 85-100 range, treating them as if they&rsquo;re exceptional even in the white world, which, of course, coupled with their natural inclination for arrogance, makes them feel as if they&rsquo;re geniuses by anybody&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a form of racism by the leftist elitists who laud these types of blacks so greatly, because they&rsquo;re saying, in effect, &#8220;I expect so little of you, I&rsquo;m absolutely amazed and ecstatic that you are able to write and speak so much better than other blacks.&#8221; </p>
<p>We had one on here who posts occassionally as a black genius claiming multiple degrees and a PHD at 21 plus.  Unfortunately he gives himself away by writing something that makes it apparent he&rsquo;s on a par with a high school graduate.  The more he posts the more evident it is he&rsquo;s an imposter.</p>
<p>Incidentally, every time he comes on here, he has a few white gullibles who jump up to defend him if anyone exposes his chicanery, making me believe that white gullibility in some whites is as devastating for whites as black incompetence is to blacks.</p>

			<p>Hmmm - Well technically it may be considered rape in the first degree but in reality, he was merely trying to exercise his artistic expression in interpersonal relationships, practicing park management if you will! Furthermore, he has only been charged, one must not rush to judgment and assume that he is guilty!  </p>
<p>Again, it is a clear case of the white person being at fault for being neither sympathetic nor understanding in stereotyping all black young men as behaving in this manner! Certainly not all young  African - American men commit rape (there has got to one, just one, somewhere, who hasn&rsquo;t &hellip; yet) and one should not judge this young African - American&rsquo;s entire life based upon one incident reflecting a slight derivation from mature judgment!</p>
<p>Expect to be seeing the Very Most Reverend Al Sharpton start blasting white mischaracterizations  &hellip; again!</p>

			<p>Well, I think I know the reason how these two valuable blacks became honor students. A perusal of the Patrick Henry High School web site shows that most of the students are either black or Hmong.  Not hard to be a star when your competition is Hmong or another brutha. The web address is http://henry.mpls.k12.mn.us/index.html. The site even has a link to the Hmong Family Phone Line for Hmong persons to call other Hmong persons and speak in their native language. <a href="http://henry.mpls.k12.mn.us/Hmong_Phone_Line.html" rel="nofollow">http://henry.mpls.k12.mn.us/Hmong_Phone_Line.html</a></p>
<p>There is also a link called I am Hmong. Hmong persons get to post information about the contributions of the Hmong culture in America.</p>
<p>And last, check out the photos from the 2007 yearbook.<br>
<a href="http://henry.mpls.k12.mn.us/Yearbook_Pictures_from_1941_-_Present.html?gallery=02448c7b-351c-432c-a4b4-e914094321b8" rel="nofollow">http://henry.mpls.k12.mn.us/Yearbook_Pictures_from_1941_-_Present.html?gallery=02448c7b-351c-432c-a4b4-e914094321b8</a><br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams.  Unfortunately, the mixed neighborhoods in California where I have mostly lived are not filled with with people emulating their examples, but the other kind.  If I lived next door to blacks like these two gentlemen, I&rsquo;d be happy to call them friends. </p>

			<p><i>An honor roll student, Thornton wrote last month in the school&rsquo;s online newspaper that he planned to attend Minneapolis Community and Technical College to major in urban park, recreation and youth development.</i></p>
<p>Yup, we all know that the top scholars of a high school want a career as midnight basketball coach.  Nothing else in the article is surprising after this.<br>

			<p>      Honor student? Does that mean he could read rap lyrics<br>
and first grade books? He didn&rsquo;t change-he just learned to hide<br>
it better. He has no honor and never will.</p>

<p>Black society has brought such comments on itself. If you are Black then you need to do some introspection and if you&rsquo;re White you are one of those who enabled those who destroyed this society. <br>
There is no such thing as a reformed or remade sexual predator. They can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t change.</p>

<p>Oh really. If you are walking alone at night and hear footsteps and turn around to see who is behind you, are you going to be more afraid if it is an elderly white woman or a young black male behind you???? BE HONEST, you are much much more going to fear the latter. It that prejudice??? No, it&rsquo;s a law of averages. Young black males are a million times more likely to attack you than an elderly white woman so you&rsquo;re fears are not prejudiced. It&rsquo;s also not prejudice here that we have the attitudes we have when so many young black males behave the way they do. As far as oppression, it&rsquo;s the white women who are victimized so often by young black male that are oppressed.</p>

<p>RK:  If they fit &#8220;similar descriptions then they are not outstanding young men,&#8221; they are black miscreants who are given more privileges than any other segment of the population, yet they continue to commit trouble and crime.  </p>
<p>Too, their fellow blacks are not doing them any favors by declaring that they&rsquo;re &#8220;gifted,&#8221; when they&rsquo;re probably far below even the white average.  They&rsquo;ll be involved in more trouble later in life when they discover that they can&rsquo;t compete with whites, and they&rsquo;ll contribute their failure to white racism and oppression, and fail to recognize their short comings, turning to crime because they can&rsquo;t succeed and also because it seems they have a natural propensity for it due to laziness and lack of morality and ethics.</p>
<p>By making these comments,  you perceive that you&rsquo;re going to fool somebody, but instead of striking a blow for blacks in general you&rsquo;re allowing people to repudiate your unsound allegations, again and again.  In other words, you&rsquo;re doing far more harm to blacks than good.  An inability to understand how harmful they are to themselves is a black trait, probably because the vast, vast majority can&rsquo;t understand logical concepts.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;..and the comments here make it clear that regardless of how hard they try they will be prejudiced against, oppressed and held down by many in our society.&#8221;</p>
<p>RK:  The comments here make your counterpoints sound ridiculous, because it is very obvious that blacks do not try, especially black males.  Blacks are privileged more than any other group in the US and it is not prejudice and oppression that make life difficult for them, it is their propensity for crime, laziness, and their lack of intelligence.  </p>
<p>&#8216;If you all are supposed to be a part of the &ldquo;American Renaissance&rdquo; then I hope it never comes about.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>RK:  There is either going to be an American Renaissance or and American conflict.  Take your pick.  Which would you rather have?  In the latter blacks will not fare so well at all.<br>

The last thing we need or desire is more blacks. They have ruined a very unique, elegant, charming, European-flavored city over the past forty years and we Whites want the city that we founded, nurtured, and sustained BACK in our hands. It was NEVER INTENDED to be a &#8220;chocolate city&#8221;, and when it was &#8220;vanilla&#8221;, it was clean, safe, picturesque, hospitable, warm, and enchanting, with fabulous restaurants, lovely hotels, lush parks, terrific music, and you name it. It just couldn&rsquo;t have been any better. In the mid-1960s, you could go months without seeing a black, and crime was very low. A murder was talked about for many months because it was such a rarity. Please know that my hometown was once a marvelous place, and that we do not need or want anything or anyone to further devalue it.</p>

<p>He graduated from high school and was admitted to a junior college that takes everyone who applies.</p>
<p>That is &#8220;gifted&#8221; in the black community.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the project mamas and political pimp preachers for their praise of black thugs when the thugs commit terrible crimes and are caught.</p>
<p>The reporters talk to everyone they can until they find someone who says something positive.  Obviously the Mother will say something positive.  Likewise the political pimp preacher.  But the reporters will never quote the woman who was afraid he was after her teen age daughters.  Reporters will never quote the teacher who says he was a disruptive thug in school.</p>
<p>The liberal reporters will always find something positive to say about the most vicious of thugs, as long as he is black.</p>
<p>Wonder what they would say about Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy or Charles Manson if they were black?  Probably &#8220;whitey made him do it.&#8221;  He&rsquo;s such a good boy.  How did society fail him?  </p>

<p>The last thing anywhere in the South needs is more blacks. Let Minnesota keep them. After all, they along with the rest of the North, accused the South of being racist were so gung-ho to integrate the South in the early 60&rsquo;s. So let them practice what they have preached.<br>

			<p>It is true that New Orleans used to be a lovely, gracious city.  Many younger people don&rsquo;t know that and think it has always been a rough place, but that isn&rsquo;t the case.  New Orleans had so much charm, sophistication, history, etc.  My dear mother was born there and had a very happy and safe childhood.</p>
<p>There are many parts of our country that used to be wonderful.  Some of our AmRen posters from Detroit talk about how first rate their city was at one time, with its beautiful art deco buildings, and how it is so sad to see it now.</p>
<p>As an esteemed author wrote, &#8220;Cities are the jewels of a nation.&#8221;  Something is very wrong when cities with prime (expensive) real estate are allowed to turn into ghettos.</p>
<p>Is there a real solution for our decaying cities?  I wonder what smart urban planners (not the illogical liberal ones) suggest we should do.</p>
