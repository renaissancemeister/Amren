<h1><a href="https://wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=67678">Polygamy, Child Brides Coming to U.S.?</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>World Net Daily, June 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Polygamy and child brides may make a comeback in the U.S. as a result of recent court rulings and the simultaneous rise of Islam, says the editor of a book of stories about Muslims leaving the faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;In light of the recent California court ruling and the FLDS (Fundamentalist Church of Latter Day Saints) legal fiasco in Texas, is the time coming when we in the U.S will be forced to tolerate child brides and multiple wives?&#8221; asks Joel Richardson, editor of the provocative new book &#8220;Why We Left Islam: Former Muslims Speak Out,&#8221; published by WND Books.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One Islamic tradition that caused several of the books contributors to leave the religion is that girls are often expected to marry adult men. For example, in the Islamic country of Yemen, 50 percent of all married women are under 14 years of age &mdash; including girls who have been married for several years. Girls as young as 6 and 7 are married to men in their 30s, 40s and 50s.</p>
<p>&#8220;In view of California&rsquo;s gay marriage ruling, how can we legally stop polygamous and child marriages of the sort seen in Muslim countries?&#8221; asks Richardson.</p>

<p>The world really is full of assholes, isn&rsquo;t it?<br>
Are you for real Mr Richardson? Are you comparing gay marriage between two CONSENTING ADULTS to the rape of helpless girls by adults and the trafficking of women and girls by primitive adults????<br>
Doesn&rsquo;t a country have the right to say No More!?! These are our laws, either abide to them or get out out of here/don&rsquo;t bother to come here?<br>
Is there no end to the &#8220;cultural&#8221; atrocities &#8220;liberal&#8221; societies are willing to justify in the name of pluralism, tolerance and culture/religion?  <br>

			<p>Yes, we definitely are seeing a &#8220;Flags of Many Nations&#8221; situation getting too close to the fan. Take, for example, just two cultural traditions of Kenya&rsquo;s Masaai tribe: depriving multiple [polygamous] widows of ALL property and progeny [devolving back to the man&rsquo;s family upon his death], and 10-year-old girls being &#8216;prepared&rsquo; with genital mutilation (circumcised) so they can be traded for cows! Here in the Eurocentric west, such people are paraded on America&rsquo;s Most Wanted as psychopathic offenders. In Africa, it&rsquo;s just part of the rich tapestry of cultural diversity; the behavior is not considered deviant in that milieu.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent point.  The fact is if two of the same sex can wed it opens the door legally for other marriage anomalies to do the same.</p>
<p>To prevent it, I believe California, and eventually the country, will need a constitutional amendment, stating that marriage is defined as between a man and woman.</p>
<p>We are living in interesting times.  Degeneration is continuing without even slowing down a bit.</p>

			<p>Although I do not favor gay &#8220;marriage&#8221; in any way, it seems a bit of an intellectual leap to believe that opens the door to child-marriage and the like. American law generally borders on fanaticism with regard to child-protection. <br>
Polygamy, however, may be another story entirely. One wonders if American society will even be recognizable in another few generations??!! </p>

			<p>Richardson&rsquo;s right. What&rsquo;s to stop bestial marriage? Why should heartless people discriminate against the love of a sheepherder for his ewe? The multiculti door is swinging wide open.</p>

			<p>Polygamy is one thing if practiced between consenting adults, but child brides would instantly run afoul of state statutory rape laws.  Don&rsquo;t expect it to be legalized.</p>

			<p>If same-sex marriage is allowed, and polygamous marriage is allowed, then why not polygamous-same-sex marriage  for homosexual men? Or lesbian women?<br>
Where will it all end?</p>

			<p>Underage girls having children is OK in America now if they are BLACK, non-Christian, and un-married.  Only WHITES have their children taken from them.  The Glouscester girls didn&rsquo;t have their kids taken away and the Moslems will not have their poligamist families broken up either.</p>

			<p>the fundemental building block of the west is the family unit - monogamous marriage. Add polygamy and the &#8216;society&rsquo; will change beyond recognition and western civilization will vanish. </p>
<p>That, of course, is the goal. </p>

			<p>Political theory, for most people, is nothing more than ecentric entertainment.  </p>
<p>When you leave their presence the people you have tried to convince of something quickly revert back to the day dreams of fishing, dating and having a good time at the ball game.</p>
<p>Your life is now in jeopardy because these same people are going to tell the next person that talks to them that you are a dangerous anti government kook.</p>

			<p>This is all because of special rights for &#8216;married couples&rsquo;. If there were no special rights - taxes, insurance policies, medical coverage, social security, etc, etc, for those who are married this would not be an issue. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s marriage itself that needs to go.</p>

			<p>When you use the public education system in the USA to systematically teach the populace they are godless animals for many years, you can get some really weird results. </p>
<p>For example, homosexuals making a mockery of the sanctity of marriage and attempting to make the right to point that out a hate crime.</p>
<p>If we let the anthropologists have their way, they would classify the chimp as human (no they really would) meaning that a person could marry a chimp and parade around in public with the chimp as a spouse. A male could even marry a male chimp and visa verca. </p>
<p>I suppose then we would have to put troops on the ground in Africa because the tribes there that hunt the chimp for food are now murdering cannibals who must all be brought to trial.</p>
<p>I mean this godless animal worldview forced upon our society has some very undesirable results and not too many people seem to care anymore after being subjected to decades of indoctrination by the godless animals themselves: modern liberals.</p>

			<p>Considering the barbarity of &#8216;forcing&rsquo; a thirteen-year-old child to &#8216;marry&rsquo; a man four, maybe five times her age, and becoming in effect a member of a harem is just as sick as what Africans do to female children or what those &#8216;holy&rsquo; Catholic priests did to involve their Church in all that litigation.</p>
<p>I firmly believe our learned judges are either bereft of their senses or otherwise mentally impaired based on the utterly ridiculous rulings recently issued.</p>
<p>B.T.W.: Forcing a 13-year-old into &#8216;marriage&rsquo; is no less evil than your typical pedophile priests using their church position to force young boys to become personal sexual toys. It should be noted those morally bankrupt priests used their role as priests and eclesiastical authority figures to force children to their [sexual] will just as surely as these equally depraved Mormon bigamists or those perverted African husbands and fathers who order or encourage the mutilation of female children. If anyone can agree with any of these abominable practices&hellip; rotsa ruck. I sure can&rsquo;t understand or forgive any of the aforementioned sickos.</p>

			<p>SRNJ&rsquo;s comments above are absolutely correct and right on the money!  No one is running around with all consuming concern over 13 and 14 year old black girls getting pregnent in this country by the tens of thousands every year, let alone the 12 year olds!  No one even asks who the father is.  Run him down and hold him accountable?  Are you kidding?  Only a matter of time and numbers before society will accept the same type of moral degredation among the Muslems.  They&rsquo;ll continue to marry little gilrs, just as they do now, they just won&rsquo;t apply for a government license.  Allah don&rsquo;t need no stinking license!</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure of that. For some time now, the feral courts have shown absolutely no regard for the democratically enacted laws of our sovereign states. They have the power to run afoul of state laws and often do.</p>

			<p>It makes me wonder why in some countries they complain about lack of women, or the unbalanced male female ratio, and at the same time they allow polygamy.  For example, in India, financially less fortunate men rent their wives to other men for money.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1953882,00.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1953882,00.html</a></p>
<p>That is, precisely, letting your wife cheat on you with other men for money!! and they have the guts to call our white ladies sluts and wh*res?  </p>
<p>wake up~ just stick with one lady and you will be happy.   </p>
