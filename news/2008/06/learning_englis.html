						<p>Hafsa Chhipa, 15, daughter of a small-time businessman in Astodia had only dreamed of speaking in English, required to fulfil her aspiration of becoming a teacher.</p>
<p>Chhipa&rsquo;s dream came true when she became part of a project conducted by Society For Promotion Of Rational Thinking (SPRAT) which imparts English language training through the US department of state&rsquo;s access microscholarship programme.</p>
<p>Currently, the two-year programme is conducted in various districts of Gujarat and more than 240 students have enrolled in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly knew English before I came here. Now, I can talk and converse properly, its a great feeling. I believe knowledge of English is essential for a good career,&#8221; says Chippa. She adds that she has acquired more confidence now and loves to speak in the language.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have received good support from my family members which has helped me learn better,&#8221; adds Chippa.</p>
<p>US Consul General in Mumbai, Michael S Owen visited the SPRAT centre on Monday and interacted with a number of young students belonging to underprivileged and disadvantaged group.</p>
<p>Owen said, &#8220;Language is the key to understand the cultural differences and learning English which is now a global language will serve as living bridges for mutual understanding,&#8221; said Owen.</p>
<p>The programme seems to have clicked well with women. M Hasan Jowher, President, SPRAT said, &#8220;We have more than 40 percent girls in our programme as they have showed keen interest in learning the language. Students come from a diverse family backgrounds including rickshawpullers, small service providers and riot victims among others.&#8221; Mansoori Paria, 15, from Juhapura said, &#8220;I want to join IIM-A and I need to know English to get in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Access microscholarship program is US department of state sponsored initiative offering students in the age-group of 14 to 18 years the chance to learn English in a interactive way. The programme builds English language communication skills that enhance student employment prospects and open a window to a broader world of ideas and opportunities our interconnected world.<br>

<p>While I understand the first impulse to leave and relocate to our ancestral nations (for me it would be the choice of Germany, France, or Ireland) as we become inundated with third worlders, that would be the worst thing to do. We abandoned our cities, streets, schools, transportation, and so on, rather than standing our ground and reclaiming what is <span class="caps">OURS, </span>and we&rsquo;ve pretty much lost them for good, <span class="caps">UNLESS </span>we finally exhibit some genuine solidarity as a race and take back everything back. </p>
<p>Fleeing, although understandable, is not the <span class="caps">END ANSWER.</span> It will not be in the best interests of our race. Why should we abandon what is rightfully ours? I realise that the the blacks bring a whole spate of terrible behavior (to phrase it kindly) but I still believe that America and her once-majestic culture are worth fighting to preserve.</p>

					<p>The bitter irony here is&hellip; it ultimately matters little whether or not the mass non-white influx learns English or not, since their spoken language is little more than a cosmetic factor that masks far deeper, more fundamental problems.  There was a recent, widely publicized study about 4th and 5th-generation Latinos, most of whom can naturally speak English to varying degrees  &mdash;   yet their school performance, drop-out levels, crime rates, incarceration levels, drug abuse problems, all become <strong>much worse upon reaching higher generations</strong> compared to the first generation, not better!  Obviously, learning English has done little to help them &#8220;assimilate&#8221;  &mdash;   little surprise, since spoken language is merely a superficial element of so-called assimilation that has little to no impact on the more fundamental aspects of behavior and aptitude that determine true assimilation.  Ironically, the more English that the post-1965 newcomers learn, the greater the social problems among a depressingly high number in terms of crime, poor educational accomplishment, drug involvement and other factors.</p>
<p>This is why, despite many years in this movement to protect my people, I have little sympathy for the English-only movement, which I find to be just a wasteful distraction of our scarce attention and resources.  It merely draws our attention away from the more profound demographic crisis that has afflicted our people  &mdash;   that by 2020, even without further mass immigration (legal levels that are even worse than the illegal levels), whites will be a minority in the <span class="caps">USA, </span>at which point we will vanish as a Western nation altogether.  Hand-wringing over surface issues like English proficiency in post-1965 immigrant groups will do nothing to save our people  &mdash;   only a cold, hard-nosed acceptance of the danger that faces us will do that.  I can&rsquo;t blame Latinos for wanting to enter the country to better their prospects, any of us would want that, but it&rsquo;s supposed to be the job of our elected leaders to protect our territorial and demographic identity  &mdash;   any nation that fails to do that, falls apart as a nation at all.  To the extent that people in less-developed nations need help, it is our leaders&rsquo; responsibility for their good, as much as our own nation&rsquo;s survival, to encourage solving problems at the source, not letting them fester and assaulting our own demographic integrity by allowing our people to be overwhelmed like this.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t keep count anymore of the number of my friends and acquaintances, from the <span class="caps">USA,</span> Canada and Australia alike, who&rsquo;ve emigrated to raise their kids in more salvageable Western nations  &mdash;   Alpine lands like Austria, Germany and northern Italy, Nordic countries like Finland and Denmark, depending on their language skills  &mdash;   that are still well over 95% white, and which tend to restrict immigration to their diasporas abroad, to those with, for example, blood ties to Germanic peoples stretching back generations.  As much as it pains me to see this mass migration among so many of my friends, I can understand their reasons for doing it  &mdash;   they appreciate the demographic changes that will soon overtake places like North America, Britain and Australia, and they want to raise their kids in a place that will still be a Western nation when their children reach adulthood.  The demographic map of the future will show a very different Western world from the one we know today.</p>

					<p>I have thought of returning to on of the countries of my ancestral people as well.  I am just not sure where to go.  Spain, Germany, Austria, and Poland are my biggest root attachments.  But&hellip; I am a Jew.  I am just not sure how welcome, if at all, I would be in any of those places.</p>

					<p>Hello Renoir at 2:36 <span class="caps">AM,</span> June 7,</p>
<p>I dont know which countries you are talking about, when you say:</p>
<p>&#8221;[&hellip;] more salvageable Western nations [&hellip;] that are still well over 95% white, and which tend to restrict immigration to their diasporas abroad&#8221;</p>
<p>Austria, Germany and Italy have significant parts of non-European populations. Of course most of these people would be considered white in Brazil. Even in America light-skinned Turks, Arabs and Persians try successfully to pass as white. <br>
But do not be mistaken here. <br><br>
Emigrating to Western Europe to raise children in a white-only environment would be a moot point, because you have to go to remote rural parts of these countries, where it is probably difficult to find a job.<br><br>
And then you can just go to a rural area in the northern US or northern Canada. The only parts &#8220;untouched&#8221; by non-whites in Western Europe are areas that lag behind ecnomically, like the eastern part of the modern Germany or some French mountain-hamlets. <br><br>
Thats because the immigrants flock only where there is something to harvest. That means to the big cities of  Europe and of course the rich areas, like Northern Italy, Benelux countries, German speaking countries and Scandinavia. <br><br>
Finland only recently has discovered that it lacks diversity, so they try to overcome this flaw.</p>
<p>Also you have to be careful when you read demographic data. For example if you have 5% nonwhites in a European town, it translates to at least 10%, often 15% nonwhites in the schools and kindergartens. You can come and see. I see it everyday in Germany and sometimes data are released. For example in the cities of Frankfurt and Nuremberg, over two thirds (67%) of all births are by ethnically non-Germans, a substantial part of them nonwhite. Furthermore in most European nations the naturalized non-whites are lumped together with the natives in the statistics. Maybe that is where you have these fantastic &#8220;95% white&#8221; from. :) <br>
So you would have to look really hard for an appropriate place in Europe. If you can stand the climate of northern Sweden or Finland, maybe this would be the place to go. A Meticulous search will reveal additional destinations for you.</p>
<p>To sum it up:   <br>
„White flight&ldquo; is not an option in the long term and capitulation never is.<br><br>
At least white flight cannot go on indefinitely and I believe it will not -  because of brave people, some of them awoken by institutions like AmRen.</p>
<p>Best regards<br>
E. Burger</p>

					<p>Do you want to know who is responsible for this abuse of taxpayer money? Look in the mirror. There he is! We are all guilty of allowing this bunch of rich kids who took over as the ruling class to run wild with our tax money without giving a damn about the poor slobs who pay for it. Don&rsquo;t cry. Get mad! Seethe inside. Visualize these abusive bastards basking in the limelight of your enforced generosity. Get really mad! Do something about it!</p>

					<p>E. Burger  &mdash;   while I&rsquo;m hardly an expert on this topic (emigration is not something I&rsquo;ve personally been considering), it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve spoken about at length with my friends who have left or are leaving, and this is my understanding: Germany and Austria do have some Turks but this population is hardly &#8220;significant&#8221; in any way.  It gets some attention due to the squeaky-wheel phenomenon, since many of Germany&rsquo;s Turkish communities have higher crime rates than the surrounding population.  But the actual Turkish percent of the population is only around 2-3% based on the most accurate surveys that actually look at Turks who are resident there, not the ones who return home (which is actually a large majority due to Germany&rsquo;s policies which  &mdash;   like those of Japan and China for example  &mdash;   tend to require returning to one&rsquo;s home country after a certain period unless one has longstanding blood ties to the country).</p>
<p>Furthermore, even among those 2-3% Turks in Germany, a surprising number are very much white and also Christian  &mdash;   it&rsquo;s important to remember that what&rsquo;s now Turkey historically was a Greek land, with high populations of Greeks and Balkan people, close to 1/5 of whom also maintained their Christian heritage.  I visited one of my old friends in Hamburg last year, and was shocked to see so many Turks who were Christian and often blond with blue eyes  &mdash;   basically indistinguishable from the Germans themselves.  Many are understandably not so happy about the state of affairs in modern Turkey, and they tend to emigrate in high numbers, especially to places like Germany or Austria.</p>
<p><span class="caps">IOW,</span> Germany and Austria really are about as solidly white as a country can get  &mdash;   demographically and culturally  &mdash;   and because of their new immigration policies, they&rsquo;re going to remain that way.  I have heard about the &#8220;diversity&#8221; talk in Finland and although I haven&rsquo;t visited there, my two contacts tell me that the diversity push there and in Estonia has had little to no effect.  Finland is a tough country to survive in for anyone who&rsquo;s not Finnish or Nordic Germanic (the two groups with historical links there), and the &#8220;diversity&#8221; experiment in Finland to allow in large numbers of non-Europeans last year utterly fizzled.  Even its strongest, most left-wing proponents were forced to admit failure and gave it up.  Italy has its problems but a surprising current of nationalism as I found when I was there.  It really does seem that this central European core  &mdash;   which fought wars of survival against invading Arab or Turkish armies in previous centuries  &mdash;   has a stronger core of nationalism than the rest of the West, which is why German is increasingly becoming the main language for what&rsquo;s left of the West.</p>
<p>Now, I agree with what you say about White flight here, which is why I&rsquo;m not personally picking up stakes.  However, you have to look at this from an objective perspective, like a statistician (which is my job), and whatever arguments you or I might make, the fact is people <strong>are</strong> leaving the <span class="caps">USA </span>and they are settling in these countries, for a variety of reasons.  Most of them don&rsquo;t consider it White flight, frankly  &mdash;   they see a very different culture between North America/UK/Australia, versus an Alpine country like Austria or Germany.  They see a weak core of identity in the former versus a stronger sense of nationalism and European pride in the latter.  Also, as one of my emigre friends told me, they see our indigenous homeland as a people in the Alpine basin, something with stronger emotional roots than North America.  So why I personally am not following in their footsteps, I can definitely appreciate their logic in emigrating.  They&rsquo;re raising their kids in lands that have a stronger core European identity.</p>

					<p>Apparently if you live outside the United States, the government would like you to learn English. However, if you live in America, the government and business will translate everything into Spanish for you so you don&rsquo;t have to learn English.</p>

					<p>Renoir,</p>
<p>I just emigrated to Germany with my wife and two small children.  We are in Frankfurt, which is where I found employment, in a nicer area (Westend).  We took the U-bahn this evening for a nice little outing to the Main River, and it was <span class="caps">FULL </span>of blacks.  I could have sworn I was on a jungle cruise.  That made up our minds about where to live.  Although the city is pleasant enough, and everything close, it is obvious that we have to have to raise the kids in a village.  I will have to commute, but it&rsquo;ll be worth it if I can find a German enough place.</p>
<p>Of course, we were already the minority in Texas from whence we fled.</p>
<p>Is any of this fair?  Of course not.  But as my late mother used to be fond of saying, &#8220;Whoever told you life would be fair?&#8221;  </p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW, </span>we are likely headed eastward eventually, to my wife&rsquo;s homeland in Russia.  I have one goal, to raise my children where they will marry others like themselves: white and Christian.  After that, it&rsquo;ll be their turn to do the same their children.</p>
<p>God Bless and preserve the white race!<br>
