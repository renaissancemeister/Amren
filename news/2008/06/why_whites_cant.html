						<p>Question:</p>
<p>This is in reference to the article, Are Whites Too Sensitive? I have read articles that this company has put out stating, What Not To Say To Blacks or What Not To Say To Latinos and so on. How come all of a sudden there is an article written saying we (whites) are too sensitive? [Is this] just because, for once, in the last 4 months I have been signed up to receive these articles, there is an article about whites and what maybe some whites feel.</p>
<p>I am a white female and I can tell you that I don&rsquo;t talk about blacks for fear I will be called a racist or be called to the table, especially in the workplace, for discrimination. We (whites), at my company, are not allowed to talk about blacks or any other ethnic group because we would get fired. I will say that whites are very sensitive now because we are discriminated against. Blacks can have the NAACP, BET (Black Entertainment Television), Black History Month, United Negro College Fund, etc. If white people were to start something like the before mentioned there would be a huge uproar.</p>
<p>I know there are white extremist groups out there but I am not talking about extremist groups. Another point I would like to make is blacks that keep bringing up how their ancestors were slaves need to look a little more into history books. Blacks were not the only ones who were slaves, all races have had slaves, and even whites. I have heard many times from blacks in my community that they did not ask to come to America. Well, my answer to that is of two fold &hellip; Nobody is forcing anyone to stay in America, you are free to leave whenever you please (and that is for every race), and, nobody took YOU personally from Africa or Asia or Spain or Italy or from anywhere else. My ancestors are from other parts of the world and I am proud to be an American. I would not have everything I have now if they decided to stay where they were.</p>
<p>I love the fact that America is a big melting pot, full of color and different cultures. Why not embrace that instead of constantly bickering over it. We need to start looking into the future instead of constantly looking behind us and pointing the finger at people who were not even thought of in the times of slavery. Yes, it was a terrible thing to have happened to anyones ancestors but until we get over the past we will never fully get along. I teach my children not to see the color but to see the person. It is getting harder to do when all they hear about in the news, school, or articles is color. Get over the color! We are all Americans and instead of fighting between ourselves, we need to worry about turning our country back around. There are important issues out there that if we do not address them and come together, then we could say goodbye to our freedom.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Thank you for your e-mail.</p>
<p>As a member of the baby boomer generation, I found your e-mail to be a real blast from the past: Your one e-mail covered most of the race-based malarkey I heard growing up. Questioning this dogma may lead you to a better place &mdash; it did for me.</p>
<p>Given your current state, I would most strongly recommend you avoid racial discussions at work. This is good advice for most people. Your e-mail gives ample reason why many people will say something worthy of being fired. I don&rsquo;t think you intended it to be offensive, but I&rsquo;m afraid much of your e-mail is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with comment about the NAACP, UNCF, etc. Black people founded these organizations to counter discrimination directed against them by white people. Keep in mind that the discrimination people faced today is NOTHING like the discrimination that existed when these organizations were founded. In our recent past, &#8220;discrimination&#8221; included thousands of African Americans being lynched and lawful bigotry like segregation. </p>
<p>The UNCF was founded to support our nation&rsquo;s network of Historically Black Colleges and Universities &mdash; the sole source of higher education for Black Americans until the 1960s. Black people had practically no access to &#8220;mainstream&#8221; higher education.</p>
<p>The NAACP was founded because legislation was passed in the early 20th century that prevented Black people from voting. Another reason the NAACP came together was lynching &mdash; until federal legislation was passed in the 1920s, thousands of Black people were murdered by hanging. The reason why federal legislation was important is that the local white-run law enforcement and judiciary proved to be incapable of prosecuting the white murderers. The NAACP was also instrumental in desegregating public higher education &mdash; with the help of the NAACP and the intercession of the federal government, James Meredith became the first Black student to be accepted to the University of Mississippi. He graduated in 1964.</p>
<p>Black Entertainment Television (BET) was launched and is still commercially viable because of the overwhelming lack of diversity in &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media. &#8220;Mainstream&#8221; media can be more accurately called white media. For example, there are practically no Black people featured in The New Yorker magazine, and no major Black characters on mega-hit television shows like &#8220;Friends&#8221; or &#8220;Seinfeld,&#8221; which were set in New York City (the city&rsquo;s population is 26 percent Black).</p>
<p>A few years ago, a major retailer sponsored an entire issue of The New Yorker and ran New Yorker-style cartoons as ads. One of the ads was a subway scene &mdash; with ALL white people (if you are familiar with New York, you will know that this is laughably impossible). This wasn&rsquo;t an isolated mistake &mdash; around the same time, the parent company of The New Yorker mounted a sequence of billboards on a building in Manhattan. The theme was how people enjoy reading magazines. However, out of more than one dozen images, there was only one non-white person &mdash; an Asian woman looking at a magazine (with a white person on the cover). Now you know why there are magazines like Black Enterprise and JET.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t think this is isolated to one retailer or one publishing company. Exclusion of people of color is a consistent theme in media and the ad agency industry. For example, I recently visited another major New York media company, to discuss &#8220;diversity.&#8221; At the time, they had 35 corporate vice presidents &mdash; one white woman and 34 white men (all non-Latino). Representation like this takes real effort to accomplish in New York &mdash; a city whose population is 65 percent Black, Latino and Asian.</p>
<p>BET exists because &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media is exclusionary. It&rsquo;s their loss: BET has earned hundreds of BILLIONS of dollars over the course of its existence.</p>
<p>I was sad to read your comment that you &#8220;have heard many times from blacks in my community that they did not ask to come to America.&#8221; You also say that if your ancestors did not immigrate to the United States, you &#8220;would not have everything I have now if they decided to stay where they were.&#8221; I was sad because you don&rsquo;t have a good grasp of the history of our country that you (and I) are proud of.</p>
<p>With the exception of recent Black immigrants from countries in Africa, Black Americans &mdash; African Americans &mdash; are descendents of enslaved people. Enslaved people were taken here against their will and were subjected to the worst deprivations that people commit against each other. Tribal languages and histories were lost because white slavers forced families apart and purposefully prevented enslaved Black people from learning to read and write. Slavery lasted for more than 200 years in our country and legalized discrimination lasted almost another 100 years during the Jim Crow era. You may want to read up on this. I suggest Frederick Douglass&rsquo;s &#8220;My Bondage and My Freedom&#8221; as a start. If you want to learn about one of our nation&rsquo;s finest periods of history, I suggest you read the three books Taylor Branch recently wrote about the Civil Rights movement.</p>
<p>Your demand that we &#8220;Get over the color!&#8221; is an expression of white privilege. It&rsquo;s only possible to &#8220;get over&#8221; it if you are in the majority culture. Assuming you&rsquo;re white, YOU can &#8220;get over the color!&#8221; but it&rsquo;s simply not possible for people of color to get over who they are, what that means and the damage our society has purposefully done over the centuries by color.</p>
<p>You close with an illuminating contradiction. You can&rsquo;t celebrate &#8220;color and different cultures&#8221; and embrace the &#8220;melting pot&#8221; at the same time. The &#8220;melting pot&#8221; is about subjugating your culture and forcing a person to &#8220;melt&#8221; into the white culture.</p>
<p>Melting who you are into a pot is not what makes a person American. What makes a person an American is embracing our Constitution, which empowers and protects our individual ability to remain ourselves.</p>
<p>The power of our nation is that we have the ability to embrace other cultures while uniting under the principles of human and civil rights. Our country is not perfect, but it consistently been better than most places on the planet. There are HUGE disparities that are defined by what &#8220;color&#8221; a person is &mdash; and gender, disability, orientation, etc. I will also say that melting into a pot obliterates the advantages that different cultures and cultural approaches to problem solving contribute to innovation.</p>
<p>When you hear criticism, you may want to consider that it is displeasure over our country&rsquo;s inability to completely live up to the promise &mdash; and potential &mdash; of what truly makes us American. The more we work toward that ideal, the more &#8220;we will get along.&#8221;</p>
<p>P.S.: I am withholding your name because it&rsquo;s fairly unique and I&rsquo;m sure you would be easily identified where you work. That&rsquo;s not my concern &mdash; I just don&rsquo;t want to dissuade other people who think like you do from writing us.<br>

			<p>This &#8220;diversity pimp&#8221; and his hectoring reply to an honest <i>cri de coeur</i> from a young white woman are living proof of my contention that the failed &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multicultural&#8221; scams in our society will never collapse and be eliminated until they stop being so lucrative for con artists like Visconti.</p>

This is the standard double-think of blacks. &#8216;I want you not to see me as black but I want you to see me as black&rsquo; or &#8216;treat me as black when it benefits me but treat me as colorless when it benefits me&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Sorry, Luke, it&rsquo;s impossible to do both at the same time. What you demand of me is to adapt a mental pathology called schizophrenia.</p>
<p>I, as a white man, will &#8216;get over color&rsquo; when blacks stop behaving as stereotypes. The day I see blacks not being black is the day I won&rsquo;t see them as black.</p>
<p>Luke, is that racist enough for you?</p>

			<p>While the rest of America moves toward tolerance, extremists of the left are vigorously fanning the dying embers of racial tension. Though their messages frequently masquerade in noble-sounding rhetoric. However, the segment of the population African  not-so-endearingly terms &#8220;Black Victicrats&#8221; are more committed to big government and self interest than to genuine social progress. <br>

			<p>&#8220;Black people founded these organizations to counter discrimination directed against them by white people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NAACP was founded by whites, blacks, and Jews.  This condescending idjit needs to do some simple fact-gathering before he starts taking on &#8220;race-based malarkey.&#8221;  </p>
<p>None of the historical black institutions   &mdash;   colleges or organizations   &mdash;   would have survived if not for white and Jewish funding.</p>
<p>Almost all of the historically black colleges were formed and funded by the DREADED WHITE PEOPLE.  <br>
 <br>
None of the civil rights laws, affirmative-action initiatives, government programs, specially designated educational opportunities, set-asides, welfare, jobs training, NONE OF ANY OF IT would have happened without WHITE PEOPLE.  Blacks have statistically not comprised more than 15% of the population, nationwide, and certainly did not have the wealth or political power to have formed ANY institutions, other than small local concerns.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Another reason the NAACP came together was lynching &mdash; until federal legislation was passed in the 1920s, thousands of Black people were murdered by hanging.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the statistics on lynching, from 1882 through 1968 only 85 blacks, or less than two percent, were &#8220;murdered&#8221; for trivial reasons.  The other roughly 4,650 lynched blacks were &#8220;murdered&#8221; for committing crimes that even liberals would consider serious if they were committed against black people.  As it happens, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what crimes are committed against whites by blacks.  See here:</p>
<p>http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/Lynchcauses.html</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Now you know why there are magazines like Black Enterprise and JET.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really?  So white people aren&rsquo;t entitled to the same rights non-whites take for granted because the New Yorker magazine does one photo spread without a sufficient number of non-whites?  Reverse white and non-white to see an incredibly repellent double standard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slavery lasted for more than 200 years in our country and legalized discrimination lasted almost another 100 years during the Jim Crow era.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve never heard it disputed that slavery ended in 1865, the above means it must have begun in 1665.  Does it matter that the US didn&rsquo;t even exist prior to 1776?  By my math slavery only lasted 89 years in the US.</p>
<p>Jim Crow has lasted much more than a hundred years now.  The difference is that it&rsquo;s now directed against whites.  Don&rsquo;t believe me?  Just try attending any kind of non-white function.  When whites ran Jim Crow blacks could ride the bus, albeit in the back.  With liberals running Jim Crow whites can no longer ride the bus at all without jeopardizing life and limb.  Steve Cohen, a white Jew who represents a largely black district in Tennessee, was denied admittance to the Congressional Black Caucus because of the color of his skin  &mdash;  an organization he only wished to join to serve his black constituents better.</p>
<p>It speaks volumes when the Uncle Tims of the world have to lie and dissemble to justify themselves.</p>

			<p>Actually, I would discourage anybody from writing to left wing radicals, utilizing sound logical arguments, because they won&rsquo;t understand what is being said, but mostly they have a propagandized mindset that disallows them the advantage of clear, coherent thinking.</p>
<p>The humorous thing about it all is that they&rsquo;ve been programmed and conditioned so thoroughly in a particular cultist belief system, the only way they could possibly return to reality is to undergo intense anti-cultist therapy from an experienced person in deprogramming people sucked into some bizarre cultist belief system.</p>
<p>The only reason this person wasn&rsquo;t waiting for the spaceship to take him to Jupiter, which we read about a while back, is because he wasn&rsquo;t programmed for that particular cult.  He was programmed to consider all things regarding diversity as true and good even though logical arguments revealing such a belief are nonsense.  </p>
<p>He missed the trip to Jupiter, but if the multicults have one scheduled for a colony on the moon, I can guarantee that he&rsquo;ll have his bags packed ready to go, and if something horrible occurs like the destruction of the mothership, making the trip impossible, and his handlers advise him to end it all, he&rsquo;ll certainly comply.</p>
<p>So, to the woman who wrote to him encouraging reason and understanding, let me say that I hope she understands now the futility of trying to offer reason and sanity to someone who can recognize neither.</p>
<p>Multicults are dangerous and should be placed in colonies like leper sancturaries to keep them from making others sick.</p>

			<p>This is an extremely common story and one that can readily be cured.</p>
<p>First, the questioner fell into verbal traps that are at least 40 years old and I suspect it is because she yearns for the old unified America in which we all felt part of the nation, and loyal to, and supportive of, it. She makes this clear with her statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all Americans and instead of fighting between ourselves, we need to worry about turning our country back around. There are important issues out there that if we do not address them and come together, then we could say goodbye to our freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>As long as the discourse centers around the preservation of the nation, the power in the discussion will reside in the answerer as we saw above. This is a tough lesson to learn, but as long as questioners make the USA into the fulcrum of the discourse, the questioner will be verbally beaten down, just as above.</p>
<p>Second, questioners need to be aware that answerers study ways to answer questions like these in the most humiliating, embarrassing way possible. Those minority conventions, media conferences, and ethnic studies classes are little else than sleazy debate schools. There&rsquo;s no way to beat them or secure agreement (for those of you naive enough to believe that such discussions are searches for truth) on their ground.</p>
<p>Third, the diverse white American peoples are in fact free to talk about anything they like so long as it is about them. Women especially should understand this because it is simply an application of the passive-aggressive psychology. Don&rsquo;t talk about blacks, don&rsquo;t define them, don&rsquo;t describe them, don&rsquo;t court them to embrace a wider view of humanity, don&rsquo;t label them. Talk about yourself and how you feel about things affecting the diverse white Americans   &mdash;   when we are called names, when we are discriminated against, when neighborhoods change for us so rapidly. It isn&rsquo;t so hard.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to speak about an individual (not all the members of a group) or company as hateful or troubling, but about all your group. Which is to say, defend all the diverse white American peoples from one person&rsquo;s or one company&rsquo;s nastiness, not from the nastiness of an entire group. There are many refinements to this policy, and you may read about them in our online syllabus as well as read an example of all this in the text of a one-page ad we placed in a tabloid bashing the major daily for using slurs. </p>

PS: Don&rsquo;t even try to use &#8220;you people,&#8221; &#8220;those people,&#8221; or &#8220;these people.&#8221; And you can attack people who use those terms on us. The slightest name, label, definition, or description put on us can be the basis for a counter-attack.</p>

			<p>  Are Whites &#8220;too sensitive&#8221;? No, BLACKS are &#8220;too sensitive.&#8221; The answer to the writer&rsquo;s posting is typical of statements made by blacks and their White apologists. All the multitude of things the White majority has done in the past 50 years to help blacks is totally ignored; things like lynching and segregation are brought up as if they were still alive (no pun intended) and well; reasons for Whites&rsquo; so-called &#8220;racism&#8221; such as blacks&rsquo; tendency toward criminality and anti-social violence are also treated as if they didn&rsquo;t exist. All this proves is that for every legitimate grievance a White person voices against so-called &#8220;diversity,&#8221; a bleeding-heart liberal or a black militant can come up with a counter argument. Any lawyer can tell you that there is no position that can&rsquo;t be countered. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s pathetic that anyone would actually pay money to be a member of that site.  The only rationale I can think of (for a white person) is that it&rsquo;s some kind of penance.  In the old days people would subject themselves to flagellation, fasting and other methods of torture in the hope of expunging their sins.  Nowadays they pay for membership in an organization like &#8220;diversityinc.com&#8221; so they can read their worthless drivel.  Personally, I&rsquo;d rather be flagellated.</p>

			<p>&#8220;With the exception of recent Black immigrants from countries in Africa, Black Americans &mdash; African Americans &mdash; are descendents of enslaved people. Enslaved people were taken here against their will and were subjected to the worst deprivations that people commit against each other. Tribal languages and histories were lost because white slavers forced families apart and purposefully prevented enslaved Black people from learning to read and write. Slavery lasted for more than 200 years in our country and legalized discrimination lasted almost another 100 years during the Jim Crow era. You may want to read up on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, this is not something that has any effect on blacks today. Blacks TODAY have never been slaves and Jim Crow was from a different era. Blacks today have benefited very much from slavery as they are a whole lot better off in America than they would have been back in Africa. As was said, slavery has existed all over the world since the beginning of time.  Jews were treated even worse during the Holocaust, had their families wiped out etc. yet their offspring(this happened recently) are quite successful. This is just another way to keep whitey on an eternal guilt trip so blacks can excuse THEIR failures and get special treatment. Not buying it.</p>

			<p>Aren&rsquo;t Whites the only race that have &#8220;gotten over&#8221; color. Unfortunately, that is what has led to our downfall. Every, other race makes everything about color. I remember when I was in the USAF how many blacks refused to eat the white meat of a chicken or even to drink white milk (and not because they were lactose intolerant). They would only eat dark meat or drink chocolate milk. Their every waking thought was about &#8220;color&#8221; </p>

<p>People of color don&rsquo;t want to get over it because that would mean losing their special rights. As someone else said, people of color want whites to be color blind when is suits them but want favortism as a person of color when it suits them. Of course, if whites are so bad, people of color could get over it by returning to their ancestral homeland where they would be the total majority. However, they&rsquo;ll never do that because they know which side their bread is buttered on.</p>

			<p><i>Your demand that we &ldquo;Get over the color!&rdquo; is an expression of white privilege. It&rsquo;s only possible to &ldquo;get over&rdquo; it if you are in the majority culture. Assuming you&rsquo;re white, YOU can &ldquo;get over the color!&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s simply not possible for people of color to get over who they are, what that means and the damage our society has purposefully done over the centuries by color.</i></p>
<p>This statement is telling. Apparently being in the minority is truly awful. And yet, whites are told that they will be the minority in 50 years, and they should celebrate this! And this fool doesn&rsquo;t see the contradiction in this. Why should whites celebrate or even allow themselves to become the minority if indeed it is so awful? Like most racial arguments of the left, this collapses if examined critically.</p>

			<p>These people also need to look at the financial situation of the managers of those various (black) organizations and see if those people would do anything out of their pockets to lift the poor black man up from &#8220;povuty&#8221; I have come to the conclusion over here in Iraq that the blacks being hired by overseas contractors such as KBR, ITT and CSA are the lowest caliber of  the blacks. I have personally seen them stealing, lazy, shiftless, passing blame for screw up onto our Indian and Philippine employees, drinking in Muslim countries, dealing drugs, prostitutes, making alcohol, chronic absenteism from work and being covered for by other black supervisors and white upper management afraid to do anything to them. They have been so stupid in their drug dealing and prostitute pandering that 2 of them ended up in a Kuwaiti jail. The embassy and ITT got them out once and they got busted again!!!! in a country with the DEATH penalty for those crimes!! one went home when the embassy managed a second time to get them out but the other one!!! busted again!! and the Kuwaitis, at the time I left Kuwait, had refused to release him again, I don&rsquo;t know the result of that.</p>

<p>No, my friend, it was white indentured servants who were subjected to the worst deprivations that people commit against each other, for the obvious reason that the slave was an investment of capital that the slave master had a vested interest in taking good care of. On the other hand, the slave master had every incentive to beat as much work out of his indentured servants as possible before the term of indenture was up.</p>

<p>Well said 10:17 PM poster! Slavery and other past wrongs are NOT the reasons for black failure today. They wanted equal opportunity so they got equal opportunity and they still couldn&rsquo;t achieve equal results. Now they want equal results mandated. Excuse me but how can you give someone achievement? Isn&rsquo;t achievement earned? How can you give someone a result?</p>
<p>Those who can achieve have achieved and those who can achieve will continue to achieve. Those who cannot achieve will continue to complain. Its not my fault that the majority of blacks are not capable of enough acheivement to make them happy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we are all paying for black under achievement in the form of welfare and other hand outs and entitlements as well as crime and vandalism. Why are so many majority black and black run cities piss holes of crime and violence? Why are so many majority black and black run countries piss holes of crime and violence? Why has Rhodesia become a piss hole? Why is South Africa becoming a piss hole? Why is Haiti still the piss hole that it is after several hundred years of black independence? Because of slavery 500 years ago? Come on. Think about how stupid that sounds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really sorry that the majority of blacks anywhere in the world cannot achieve even what they need to consume in order to survive. The fact is that most blacks do not have the intelligence, aptitude or ability to achieve beyond what we see today. Compassionate achievers for the most part do not want to simply let them wallow and die off. Hence wellfare, entitlements and hand outs. These people will have to be carried by the achievers. I realize that is a bit of Marxist socialism. From each according to their ability. To each according to their needs. Unfortunatle that is the only solution I see.</p>

The thug was sitting there talking to a woman with a child when he suddenly jumped up and began assaulting the man (lack of impulse control). When he got the phone he calmly exited the bus carrying his shirt which he had lost during the scuffle. This happened a month ago but the Columbus PD just released the video.<br>
And they ask why Whites can&rsquo;t get over color.<br>
The man appeared to be fighting back at least. Too bad he wasn&rsquo;t packing. It would have been a better video to watch. <br>

Give me a book and tell me there will be a test in 3 months and I&rsquo;ll pass it. More then half of black people cannot do this and its not because their great great great grandfather was a slave. Its because they don&rsquo;t have the intelligence or the aptitude. How does this joker explain the fact that many blacks DO pass these tests? His argument falls apart, does it not?</p>

<p>From the Article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Black people founded these organizations to counter discrimination directed against them by white people&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The NAACP was NOT founded by blacks but rather by White and Jewish elitists.</p>
<p>As Professor McDonald explains:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;The NAACP was founded in 1909 by wealthy German Jews, non-Jewish Whites and blacks led by W.E.B. DuBois&hellip; blacks played little role in these efforts until the late 1930s&hellip;.the first black became chairman in 1934.</p>
<p>Small wonder that a bewildered Marcus Garvey stormed out of NAACP headquarters in 1917 muttering that is was a White organization&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="/estore/catalog/product_1610_Race_and_the_American_Prospect_cat_95.html" rel="nofollow">/estore/catalog/product_1610_Race_and_the_American_Prospect_cat_95.html</a></p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Black Entertainment Television (BET) was launched and is still commercially viable because of the overwhelming lack of diversity in &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; media. &#8216;Mainstream&rsquo; media can be more accurately called White media&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>Larry Elder writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The NAACP periodically accuses &#8216;Hollywood&rsquo; of engaging in a &#8216;blackout.&rsquo; But in 2002, the Screen Actors Guild reported that 15.5 percent of all theatrical and TV roles went to blacks   &mdash;   more than the percentage of the population of blacks in America&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=3900</p>
<p>And there are how many &#8216;people who look like me&rsquo;, i.e., White, on BET?   Are Whites employed at BET according to their percentage of the American population as blacks insist for themselves in White-owned businesses?  Explain to me why Whites are not allowed to have WET-TV reflecting White values and culture?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;BET has earned hundreds of BILLIONS of dollars over the course of its existence&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, because Whites are FORCED to pay for it by cable companies that do not allow a menu-like option to only pay for those channels the subscriber prefers.  </p>
<p>How long do you think BET would last if Whites and Hispanics were allowed to drop BET from their cable line-up?</p>
<p>How about addressing Whites&rsquo; very real concern about black-on-White crime, and the fact that blacks HUNT for White victims:</p>
<p> &ldquo;&hellip;.Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. Forty-five percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black,&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>http://www.vdare.com/buchanan/070820_crime.htm</p>
<p>As statistician La Griffe Du Lion reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In the city, the races live mostly apart from one another, so that the most convenient victims of thugs are others of the same race. Only a hunter&rsquo;s mentality could account for the data&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again.  The Family, the most basic bio-social unit since the invention of the city 6,000 years ago, is falling apart, and not one word from just about everyone. As if ignoring the problem makes it go away, or, makes it irrelevant. <br>
So instead of facing and attempting to correct this problam (and it IS correctable) we make it worse by focusing all of our attention on Race. With obvious results, ie; The Family continues to disinegrate while producing people unfit to live in decent society, which itself results in a society that is no longer decent, and, not surprisingly, Race relations do NOT improve. Obama as an individual is a deposit of this type of culture. While the Obama phenomenon is a perfect symptom of the outbreak and rapid spread of this disease. And that&rsquo;s the right word.<br>
But I personally hold both the Left and the Right responsible. Just as I hold our inability to transcend the by now obvious limitations of the Left and Right, responsible for the overwhelming victory of the Left, which very well might crush the Human Spirit for a long time to come and reduce all of Humanity to a culture of food-gathering automatons.<br>
Has it dawned on anyone, including those who like to prate all day long about Genetics, that the Left talks on and on about the Environment as the determining influence, meaning Society, and never once mentions the very Institution where all of us are socialized – The Family?  It&rsquo;s an astonishing omission on their part, but even worse is the fact that few today seem interested, or able, to point this out, beyond the few boring, dreary, and exceedingly vague platitudes about &ldquo;Family Values&rdquo; that come from the Right. <br>
No idea is worth killing someone over. But some ideas ARE worth fighting against.   <br>
And I would say that the absurd notion that Race trumps Family qualifies as something worth fighting against.<br>

<p>Jonah Goldberg sometime back pointed out an interesting phenomenon regarding Obama&rsquo;s popularity among whites. In states in which there are relatively few blacks, such as mid-western locales, Obama did very well among whites. But in areas in which there are large numbers of blacks with whom whites must come in contact frequently, he did much less well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very good points. I truly enjoy Jonah&rsquo;s insights and other conservative Jewish authors and radio personalities. Like you, I&rsquo;m not a racist, but a realist. That means seeking real change in a real way that offers real desirable results for my country, my family, and myself. Modern liberalism just doesn&rsquo;t offer that.</p>

<p>You, and Mr. Visconti, confuse the &#8216;white privilege&rsquo; with higher IQ. If blacks had higher IQs, they too would appear to be privileged. Their genetic lower IQ has always and will always prevent them from appearing &#8216;privileged&rsquo;.</p>
<p>To prove my point, look at any nation that is historically and or predominantly black. Surely, in such nations, there is the equivalent of &#8216;black privilege&rsquo;. If &#8216;privilege&rsquo; were the key, blacks who were the majority should reap the same &#8216;black privilege&rsquo; rewards as those whites who allegedly benefit from &#8216;white privilege&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with privilege and everything to do with genetics and IQ.</p>

			<p>No, my friend, it was white indentured servants who were subjected to the worst deprivations that people commit against each other, for the obvious reason that the slave was an investment of capital that the slave master had a vested interest in taking good care of. On the other hand, the slave master had every incentive to beat as much work out of his indentured servants as possible before the term of indenture was up.</p>
<p>Posted by qwerty at 3:27 AM on June 21 </p>
<p>YES INDEED!! I posted such a comment before and it did not get posted but this is of course true. A slave was a &#8216;PAID FOR ASSET&#8221; and would not have been abused out of hand, but an indentured servant?? is some one who owes money and is going to be flogged for every nickle of it, and in many cases the indentured person was murdered before the term was up in sheer spite. It says something of the integrity and honor of the indentured person to have stayed and attempted to fulfill the contract when the opportunity to run away was at hand. Pointedly, almost ALL indentured slaves (call it what it was) were white christians.</p>

<p>If posting on this site makes one a bigot, then the reason that brought me to this site is my personal association with and treatment by blacks. Admittedly not all are bad but I have found that color trumps friendship with blacks. If blacks of a group involve your black friend and they choose to assault you, he will not help unless he helps them. So yeah, I have become RACISSSSSSS!</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not about hate. When an employer hires &#8220;smart,&#8221; which is an HR term for being careful, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the people not hired were hated, rather it means that the employer legally &#8216;discriminated&rsquo; in choosing the best person for the position. Since the U.S. civil rights movement; since the independence of colonial African nations in the &rsquo;60s; and since the abolishment of Apartheid, blacks have demonstrated ABSOLUTELY APPALING behavior across the board. It&rsquo;s no wonder that people stay at arm&rsquo;s length &hellip; and not because of hate, but because of normal and natural instincts of self-preservation. Interestingly, not a SINGLE instance of a predominately black country or enclave exists or has existed where blacks have prospered on their own.</p>

			<p>So Latrice, you anti-white bigot, if I am privileged how come I belong to the only race in this country that government agencies, companies, and universities are allowed to discriminate against, and in many cases forced to?  How come high schools allow African-American clubs, Hispanic clubs, and Asian clubs, but forbid European American clubs, even in school systems where whites are the minority?  Why are pro-black black people &#8220;civil rights leaders&#8221; but pro-white white people dangerous bigots whom the ADL and SPLC try to hound out of their jobs?<br>

<p>Hey, Latrice. I&rsquo;ve achieved a middle class existence for myself and I&rsquo;ve worked for all of it. Nobody ever gave me anything.</p>
<p>Today any black with a half a brain has got it made. Colleges, Universities (including the elite Universities) and companies go out of their way to recruit any black who can do anything more than just hang around. Once the black is in these institutions it is VERY difficult to get rid of them even for poor to mediocre performance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also getting tired of hearing how I somehow benefit from slavery. Slavery was not the economic powerhouse that you think it was. Slaves had to be purchased, housed and fed. It would not have cost a heck of a lot more, if it even cost more, to have paid them minimum wage and let them house and feed themselves. Also, of course, they would not have had to be purchased. Think about it. Cheap labor is all they were and all they would have been in either case.</p>
<p>Many blacks have achieved middle class or better in this country. There is no longer anything in their way. In fact they are privileged because they are black. Their success refutes your claim!</p>
<p>Hey Latrice, the reason many blacks do not achieve is because they cannot achieve. There may be a few who could achieve but get caught up in the &#8216;black culture&rsquo; but for the most part if they can achieve they do. Quit telling me that blacks cannot achieve because they are held back somehow. Its simply not true. That argument is not cutting it anymore.</p>

			<p>White privilege means Whites have unearned wealth.  As far as I can wreckon, all socialists believe in zero sum economics- the gain of one comes at the expense of the other.</p>
<p>They seem to think that the Whites found pre-existing wealth (natural resources??) in some huge warehouse, then sequestered this wealth for their own emolument, AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PEOPLES OF COLOR.</p>
<p>Other collectivists are hard core determinists, denying the existence of volition (free will).  Wealth is from luck, anonymous social forces, or stolen, but never arises from personal effort.</p>
<p>Having raw, genetic IQ, may involve luck, but the smart brain DOES NOT OPERATE AS A MACHINE.  FOCUS is required.  Wealth is not produced without massive amounts of effort, sometimes called work.</p>
<p>If the left admitted that Whites are gifted (privileged) in terms of IQ, then they would be admitting inequality.  So by privilege they can only mean- we (Whites) stole the wealth- they want to use state coercion to return the wealth to itz rightful owners. </p>

<p>The humorous thing about it all is that they&rsquo;ve been programmed and conditioned so thoroughly in a particular cultist belief system, the only way they could possibly return to reality is to undergo intense anti-cultist therapy from an experienced person in deprogramming people sucked into some bizarre cultist belief system&hellip;</p>
<p>So, to the woman who wrote to him encouraging reason and understanding, let me say that I hope she understands now the futility of trying to offer reason and sanity to someone who can recognize neither.</p>

<p>As others have pointed out, a country that is 100% white has no &#8220;white privilege&#8221;.  It is only when non-whites move to that country and don&rsquo;t do as well as whites, that this white privilege suddenly is discovered.  Whites must then give resources to the non-whites to absolve the whites of their guilt.  So the concept of white privilege is just a clever ploy to take wealth from whites.  It is an example of black psychopathy preying on white altruism.  It is a hostile gimmick - just like &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>

			<p>There is some truth in the black desire to have &#8220;black&#8221; public things because they got the shaft from the dominant culture in the past. However, today, it&rsquo;s often used as a way to bash whites and, to enhance that many emotional/uncritical whites have.  </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to call anything that we do &#8220;white&#8221;, just show your interests, history, ancestry, culture, etc. in a positive way, which those things are.<br>
Let the minorities and, liberals make the claim about too much white. The more I learn more about my &#8220;past&#8221; and, I carry it on my shoulder. It&rsquo;s not right because it&rsquo;s white, it&rsquo;s right because it&rsquo;s good!</p>

<p>In general, however, it&rsquo;s clear that &#8220;Latrice&#8221; was a plant, probably by Luke Visconti to collect responses. We need to understand that the conflict on the level of blogging and talking is not about facts. It is about a campaign of defamation carried out with utmost determination to demoralize and demonize the diverse white American peoples. Believing that a review of facts will change this campaign into Obama&rsquo;s national discussion on race is a grave error.</p>
<p>At this level, we have a purely logocentric conflict which needs to be dealt with by logocentric methods, not emotions or evidence. That is, the deceptions by the people like Luke Visconti need to be confronted by a kind of deconstruction of his remarks, not an effort to make those people see the light. These people are hardened cold war warriors and the level of our discourse about them has to be about their discourse and its purposes, not efforts to rebut them with facts. I know it sounds strange, but they put far too much effort into their one-sided version of the facts, packaged into clever messages of hate, which overwhelm us. It&rsquo;s their remarks that need analysis, not the facts they allege in their remarks.</p>

<p>Your problem is your refusal to acknowledge the obvious in your own culture.  Blacks own inferiority complex is the only thing holding them down, along with their incessant whining and complaining that EVERYONE WHITE owes them something. How simple it is to avoid the hard work and dedication it takes to make something of oneself when one can simply sit on the pity pot and blame others for their misfortune.  When does the statute of limitations on blaming whites end?  I suppose it never will, at least as long as we are all not a light shade of brown.</p>
<p>Other than BLACKS, what other culture can you name that does NOT want their children to do better than them? What other culture embraces thuggery, emulates &#8220;gangstas&#8221;, and does not believe in the importance of fathers as positive role models in the home?

<p>     That is exactly what I told a black guy when he was complaining about colonialism. He was pissed about the fact that it was Europe which built all those global empires but not Africa. Blacks obviously did not have the ability and technology to conquer the Native Americans (defeated black soldiers would have made good sacrifices for the Aztecs) let alone Europeans and Asians. But think what if blacks would have conquered Europe. Think of all that mass raping, genocide, and slavery. And do you think a black Abraham Lincoln or a black David Livingstone would have in the name of righteousness lobbied for setting White slaves free? Do you think black armies would fight each other like the one fought at Gettysburg for this matter? Do you think black troops would have attacked the forts of other black empires to free White slaves like what the British troops did to those Spanish and Portuguese forts on Africa&rsquo;s coast?</p>

			<p>&#8220;I have never heard or read where &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is truly defined with any clarity. Nor have I read what it is about &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; that is to be celebrated, or how it is to be enjoyed and certainly I have never heard or read about who it is that must celebrate &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Diversity simply means more women or people of color, and more ideas from them. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s Beverly Hills or the Detroit public schools; Harvard, Wesleyan, or Howard, even the USA or Africa, in either case respect for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; means more respect for women and people of color. It&rsquo;s always about advancing them at the expense of anyone else. There are never calls to increase the number of female garbage collectors, for example, or calls to eliminate, for white men, any unpleasant social statistics which might afflict them, let alone fighting against this evil. They prefer to avoid admitting this if possible, that &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, means physically certain groups of people (no matter the demographics or location), because it makes them look more racist than they really are, which is pretty obsessed with their racial policies to begin with. Instead the talk will be about goals or commitments to excellence. It&rsquo;s not hard to figure it&rsquo;s true meaning. Every place that has a diversity policy is actively discriminating against whites. This is normally backed up by anti-white rhetoric. Often there is a forum where diversity is discussed, usually run by one of an endless number of &#8216;minority&rsquo; special interest groups at the school or workplace, or these groups will be prominently invited to speak. There could be calls to form new &#8216;minority&rsquo; interest groups as a call to action. White groups are never invited to talk about this all important and necessary diversity, and anyone who might argue about it all is considered evil</p>

			<p>Please don&rsquo;t think this is isolated to one retailer or one publishing company. Exclusion of people of color is a consistent theme in media and the ad agency industry. For example, I recently visited another major New York media company, to discuss &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; At the time, they had 35 corporate vice presidents &mdash; one white woman and 34 white men (all non-Latino). Representation like this takes real effort to accomplish in New York &mdash; a city whose population is 65 percent Black, Latino and Asian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who cares?  This is a white country.</p>

			<p><i>It says something of the integrity and honor of the indentured person to have stayed and attempted to fulfill the contract when the opportunity to run away was at hand.</i></p>
<p>It probably had more to do with the severe penalties that could be imposed for running away from a term of indenture. Indentured servants could be hanged for trying to escape. I don&rsquo;t know if runaway slaves could be hanged, but if they could, they were probably much less likely to be hanged because, as has already been mentioned, they were worth a lot of money.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You close with an illuminating contradiction. You can&rsquo;t celebrate &ldquo;color and different cultures&rdquo; and embrace the &ldquo;melting pot&rdquo; at the same time. The &ldquo;melting pot&rdquo; is about subjugating your culture and forcing a person to &ldquo;melt&rdquo; into the white culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>And YOUR melting pot is the subjugation of white culture and forcing us to &#8220;melt&#8221; into a culture of lawlessness, immorality, and subjugation to a cult - multiculturalism - which has failed in pretty much every country that&rsquo;s ever tried it.  Not that many have.  And for good reason.</p>
<p>Behind this response is the same tired old lie&hellip; that every culture has a right to its&rsquo; traditions and beliefs, EXCEPT white people.  It is the only truly acceptable form of racism left.</p>
<p>In my life, I have made it a point NOT to back down on these sort of conversations (I&rsquo;m not a politician nor work in a huge office so I really don&rsquo;t have much to lose).  The response&hellip; after the initial shock that I would say something &#8220;so outrageous,&#8221; people usually confess that is &#8220;refreshing&#8221; to hear.  </p>
<p>I do not use certain PC phrases such as the despicable phrase &#8220;people of color&#8221; which implies whites have no color.  &#8220;People of color&#8221; is a racist phrase.</p>
<p>And, yes, I do feel priveledged to be white and come from the traditions I do.  And I am also not stupid enough to take this for granted.  I do know there are many minority folks - and even more suicidal, brain-dead white liberals not the responding idiot - who would love to take it all away and force whites into subjugation. These psychophantic white race-traitors will embrace the failed cult of diversity until their own (and their children&rsquo;s) deaths and actually believe they&rsquo;re doing something righteous.  These people are pathetic simulations of human beings, but they can change&hellip; it only takes one mugging!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Look at the Hurricane Katrina case for more evidence. That was a large-scale example of what happens when Wal-mart, McDonalds, and package liquor stores close for a few hours; Blacks quickly revert. I&rsquo;ve witnessed many disasters in my lifetime, but I have never witnessed Whites behaving like barbaric animals on a large-scale&#8221;</p>
<p>Even other non-white races don&rsquo;t act like this. If hurricane Katrina had happend to an all Hispanic or Oriental community or an all Arabic  community, this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Assuming you&rsquo;re white, YOU can &ldquo;get over the color!&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s simply not possible for people of color to get over who they are, what that means and the damage our society has purposefully done over the centuries by color.&#8221; </p>
<p>A rather obvious stratagem from the playbook of the enemies of our ancestors and our posterity! In essence, they demand that European Man spiritually disarm, submit and dissolve his identity, but Blacks and other non-whites must organize in solidarity, and prepare for competition with and even to do battle against Whites, because it is their duty and their right to do so. </p>
<p>Why would any self-respecting human being, of any color, buy into this rigged game and willingly assume the role of villain and sacrificial victim, as whites are called upon to do by the cultural Marxists that set today&rsquo;s &#8220;diversity policy&#8221;? Self-hatred? Guilt? Brain damage? Satanic possession? Stockholm syndrome? </p>
<p>When the fruits of diversity are harvested and our society implodes, the culprits will scamper off to a certain middle eastern country and laugh at out plight from afar as they indulge their favorite pastime of &#8220;dancing on their enemies&rsquo; graves.&#8221; <br>

			<p>&#8220;White Priviledge&#8221;</p>
<p>I get somewhat enraged everytime I think of this, as ever having applied to my life. I have never been given a single thing by this society I haven&rsquo;t worked for. The same goes for my parents who worked like oxen. I know this is the case with most Americans also. There may be &#8220;white priviledge&#8221; now and have been in the past with the small minority of whites.</p>
<p>In the nineteen sixties book,&#8221;The American Gospel of Success&#8221;, by Moses Rischin, a collection of essays by various writers, it is pointed out in a Chapter titled &#8220;The Recruitment of the American Business Elite&#8221;, by William Miller, that at the time the giant corporations were forming in the U.S., no more than 3 percent of the executives came from the lower classes, like farm boys, laborers, etc. This put a stop to the nonsensical idea that big  American business was formed by Horatio Alger types. In other words &#8220;white priviledge&#8221; in the form of some easy path to success being available to whites, was mostly confined to the upper classes where it really counted.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;If blacks had held the power do you think they ever would have freed us? &ldquo;</p>
<p>Not only would they, they did.  Most of the Africans who were shipped into European slavery were actually, prisoners of war/slaves in their homelands.  African slavery, it is widely accepted by African historians now, could be compared to weak indentured servitude; a couple of years of forced labor followed by an induction ceremony into the tribe, a piece of land and the opportunity to marry one of the tribeswomen.  Can you imagine if that had been the policy in the old south?</p>

<p>In order to survive as a race we whites need to avoid statements such as the last one in the above post.  While said in jest, this is exactly the kind of emotionally charged talk that will turn off more mainstream whites to our cause.  Instead, we need to play the victim as much as possible (that shouldnt be hard b/ c we are)&hellip;  By avoiding hateful statements and disassociating ourselves with violence we will win a much more POWERFUL victory.  White separtism is a far more attractive posistion than neo-nazism or white supremacism b/c it doesnt carry all of the negative stigmas of hate crime.  As a graduate student I have to be extremely PC in order to present my opinions in the liberal dominated world of academia.  However, this has made me more successful as not coming off as &#8220;racist.&#8221;  Once society at large thinks of you as a racist no one will never consider anything you have to say.  People concerned about the survival of our race (which is certainly on the decline: look up the decline in birth rates in Europe, Russia, Canada, and the US) NEED to tone down their passion and do what is BEST for our cause.  The BEST thing we can do to help spread this NOBLE cause is to be as articulate and PC as possible in an attempt to educate moderate whites that interracial marriage leads to a loss of our history, heritage and cultural&hellip; </p>
<p>Remember the multiculturalists are working hard to present their as non-racist and righteous so they might win the youth of America to their cause.  </p>
<p>We whites must counter them by exposing their opinions as biased and racist to other whites who are on the fence.  This must be done in only a concerned and PC manner and never done through force or violence.  When a white committs a hate crime all of the multiculturalist/ globalists jump at the chance to show that white racism is alive and well, which serves as further reason and evidence for them that Americans needs more multiculturalism&hellip;</p>
<p>Remember BE INTELLIGENT about your righteous cause.  ARYAN PRIDE!</p>

			<p>It is possible when dealing with confused, brainwashed whites to gently present the facts (such as crime rates by non-whites against whites, and declining birth rates for whites, etc.) so that they realize the danger we are in and we don&rsquo;t scare any neophytes away from our cause (i.e., white racial survival into the 21st Century, not an unreasonable wish.)  </p>
<p>However, when dealing with hate-filled anti-white people, the way we present our viewpoints matters not.  Whether we are angry or sad, those who dislike whites on principle will shut down the conversation because our views so differ from theirs: that whites are inherently bad (and deserve everything bad that is happening to them) and non-whites are inherently good (and deserve all the world&rsquo;s bounty because of past unfair treatment by whites, and only whites).</p>
<p>We are dealing with a subtle, ubiquitous and very effective worldwide program to marginalize whites.  PC culture is a way of putting a muzzle on white dissent.  Notice how we have to be so very, very careful with everything we say when with minorities, while minorities are free to express themselves in all sorts of ugly ways with very few restrictions.   </p>
<p>The point is our enemies want us mute, powerless and finally, bred out of existence.  Our race is definitely going through a hard time right now, but things will get better.  Stay strong, and God bless.</p>

			<p>friendly white person, &#8220;Why do we have to be so very very carefull with what we say to minorities&#8221;. If I&rsquo;ve been wronged by a minority at the workplace, etc. I confront them about it, and always have, and have never gotten into trouble. What many white people need is not more care in their speech, or more empathy, but B-LLS. SIMPLE AS THAT. If whites are being abused and continue to allow it they will be in a situation similar to one that a great writer described, &#8220;the more he did nothing the less time he had to do anything&#8221;.</p>
