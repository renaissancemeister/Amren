<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>On the way to his rendezvous with destiny, Barack Obama consistently lost white voters, especially of the middle and working classes, to Hillary Clinton &mdash; voters variously known as Appalachians or Reagan Democrats, rural voters and white ethnics in the industrial states. Because of this, he lost most of the big swing states that a Democrat needs &mdash; Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia (which would have made Gore president in 2000 had he won there), that last by a staggering 41 points. Heading into the general election, in which the weight of the black vote will shrink as compared to its importance in the Democratic primaries, this weakness emerged as the prime threat to his promising candidacy and gave birth to two schools of thought on its cause.</p>
<p>School number one thinks it reflects racial hostility that Obama&rsquo;s opponents &mdash; first Hillary Clinton and now John McCain and the Republican party &mdash; are doing their best to rub raw. This is a case that Democrats have been making for the past 30-plus years, and its most recent airing came in a long piece in the May 19 Newsweek by Evan Thomas and Richard Wolffe. &#8220;The real test is yet to come,&#8221; they warned. &#8220;The Republican Party has been successfully scaring voters since 1968, when Richard Nixon built a Silent Majority out of lower-and-middle-class folks frightened or disturbed by hippies and student radicals and blacks rioting. The 2008 race may turn on which party will win the lower and middle-class whites in industrial and border states &mdash; the Democrats&rsquo; base from the New Deal to the 1960s, but &lsquo;Reagan Democrats&rsquo; in most presidential elections since then. It is a sure bet that the GOP will try to paint Obama as &lsquo;the other&rsquo; &mdash; as a haughty black intellectual who has Muslim roots.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this view &mdash; let us call it the Newsweek Doctrine &mdash; race is the issue.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. {snip} If Obama loses, this will be the excuse of the campaign and of the press that supports it.</p>
<p>The second school of thought admits the presence of bias as a contributing factor, but not the most important one. The real cause, it thinks, is a cultural divide among whites that splits them on matters of worldview and attitude into hostile and competing camps. Let us call this rival approach the Barone Manifesto, after its author, political analyst Michael Barone, who crunched the poll numbers for Obama&rsquo;s primary battles with Hillary Clinton and discovered that while the former did exceedingly well with white voters in university towns and state capitals, he did poorly almost everywhere else. From this, Barone broke the electorate down into two large divisions &mdash; academics and state employees who live in these places, whom he calls Academicians, and Jacksonians, who live elsewhere, especially in the regions close to the Appalachian mountains.</p>
<p>While the term Academician explains itself, Jacksonian comes from Andrew Jackson, the first of the Democrats&rsquo; warrior heroes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. {snip}</p>
<p>The divisions between these two classes tend to be deep. Academicians traffic in words and abstractions, and admire those who do likewise. Jacksonians prefer men of action, whose achievements are tangible. Academicians love nuance, Jacksonians clarity; academicians love fairness, Jacksonians justice; academicians dislike force and think it is vulgar; Jacksonians admire it, when justly applied. {snip}</p>
<p>Academicians don&rsquo;t think &#8220;evil forces&#8221; exist, and if they did, they would want to talk to them. This, and not color, seems to be the divide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was when they lost their warrior edge that Democrats started losing the White House, winning only in unusual circumstances such as the Watergate scandal or in that brief window in history (from the fall of the Berlin Wall through September 11) when foreign threats had faded out of the picture. Reagan Democrats did resent post-1968 liberal activism &mdash; and racial preferences and busing much more than the original Civil Rights measures &mdash; but they also were drawn to the muscular foreign policy, democracy promotion, and unabashed patriotism of the FDR-HST-JFK line. When these were picked up by Ronald Reagan &mdash; who was himself an FDR fan and the very prototype of the Reagan Democrat &mdash; they quite willingly followed his lead into his new political bailiwick. When academicians insist that Republicans use fears about race and other cultural flashpoints to blind middle and lower class voters to what they call their &#8220;real interests,&#8221; they forget that to most voters defense and security are often the most &#8220;real&#8221; issue of them all.</p>
<p>This neglect often leads to a reading of history that aligns rather poorly with the facts. It is true that Johnson lost the South in 1964 to the Civil Rights issue, but he also won almost everything else on the table. And when the Democrats fell apart in the 1968 cycle, it owed more to Vietnam and rioting students than anything else. {snip} After 1968, Democrats would win and lose for a number of reasons, none of which seemed to touch on their civil rights stances, which did not seem to vary. On the other hand, it appears indisputable that, both before and after the Civil Rights battles, Democrats lost when they put up an anti-Jacksonian, who seemed both weak and too wordy in foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Adlai Stevenson, the Democrats&rsquo; first major anti-Jacksonian, lost twice by large margins to General Eisenhower, the man who freed Europe. Following him, academicians such as Gary Hart, Bill Bradley, and &#8220;Clean Gene&#8221; McCarthy couldn&rsquo;t even get nominated.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. {snip}</p>
<p>As a political type, Barack Obama is not Middle America&rsquo;s idea of a &#8220;black&#8221; candidate, wholly unlike Al Sharpton (who ran briefly in 2004) or a demagogue such as Jesse Jackson, who put the fear of God into Democratic leaders when he won the Michigan caucuses in 1988. But he is beyond doubt the Academician Incarnate, heir to all of the (white) priests before him. Even some of his more notable missteps recall the gaffes that they made in the past. His complaint in Iowa about the high price of arugula at Whole Foods (an expensive grocery chain much favored by trendies) recalled Michael Dukakis&rsquo;s advice to Iowa farmers that they grow Belgian endive; his faux pas at a fundraiser at a millionaire&rsquo;s pad in San Francisco about small town residents of Pennsylvania who cling to God and guns out of sheer desperation recalled the &#8220;joke&#8221; told by Gary Hart in the 1984 cycle about toxic wastes in New Jersey while at a millionaire&rsquo;s pad in L.A. {snip} .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Obama&rsquo;s main theme, which has listeners swooning, is an inchoate though inspiring mantra of &#8220;change.&#8221; &#8220;Obama is not at all a warrior, and is something of an academic,&#8221; writes Barone:</p>
<p>He is all college campus and not at all boot camp. He has campaigned consistently as an opponent of military action in Iraq. His standard campaign statements on Iraq seem to suggest that all honor should go to the opponents of the war and none to the brave men and women who have waged it. He clearly lacks the military expertise of John McCain or Hillary Clinton, both diligent members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Like another eloquent little-known Illinois politician who emerged suddenly as an attractive presidential candidate, Adlai Stevenson, he seems more comfortable with the language of diplomacy and negotiation than with the words of war. Like Stevenson, he speaks fluently and often eloquently but does not exude a sense of command. He is an interlocutor, not a fighter. His habit of stating his opponents&rsquo; arguments fairly and sometimes more persuasively than they do themselves has been a political asset among his peers and press but not among Jacksonians, who are more interested in defeating than in understanding their enemies.</p>
<p>And he is up against John McCain, a true Jacksonian if ever there was one. Of course, he dispatched another Jacksonian in Hillary Clinton, who, against all expectations, emerged as a lower-to-middle-class spokesman, and all-purpose warrior queen. As a feminist and graduate of Wellesley and Yale, she was an unlikely choice to appeal to Jacksonians, but she won them over by her grit and tenacity and her stubborn refusal to give in to pressure. Like McCain, she gave the impression that she would never stop fighting, while Obama, as Barone puts it, gave &#8220;the impression, through his demeanor and through his statements that he would never start.&#8221; Obama may be the first nonwhite with a serious chance of reaching the White House, but he is also the latest in a long line of anti-Jacksonians who have tried, and have failed, to win the office of president. The second obstacle may prove more formidable than the first.</p>
<p>In 1984 and 1988, Jesse Jackson, the first black candidate to compete seriously in the national primaries, won the black vote in them by huge nine-to-one margins, but carried virtually nobody else. Historically, priest-like white candidates win the upscale white vote and the students, but tend to do poorly elsewhere. As the first black candidate to run on the wine track, Barack Obama combines these two demographics, though to his credit his appeal is nonracial, and he did not begin to win large tracts of black voters until after taking lily-white Iowa almost by storm. {snip}</p>
<p>This is the pattern Barone found in Obama&rsquo;s battles with Clinton. &#8220;When I first noticed Obama&rsquo;s weak showings among Appalachians, I chalked them up, as many in the press will be inclined to do, to an antipathy to blacks,&#8221; Barone allowed. But then he went back and compared the results from the Virginia primary race on February 12, with those in the gubernatorial election of 1989, in which Democrat Douglas Wilder defeated Republican Marshall Coleman to become the country&rsquo;s first black governor since Reconstruction. In the Appalachian precincts of western Virginia &mdash; which border both Kentucky and West Virginia &mdash; Wilder, a moderate Democrat with an air of authority, greatly outpolled Obama everywhere in the region. &#8220;Jacksonians in southwest Virginia showed no aversion to Wilder. Take Buchanan County, which runs along both West Virginia and Kentucky. In 1989, it voted 59 percent to 41 percent for Wilder.&#8221; In February 2008, it voted for Clinton over Obama by 90 to 9. &#8220;Wilder lost what is now the Ninth Congressional District (long known as the Fighting Ninth) by a 53-percent-to-47-percent margin. But that is far less than the 59-percent-to-39-percent margin by which George W. Bush beat John Kerry in the district in November 2004 or the 65-percent-to-33-percent margin by which Clinton beat Obama there in February 2008. Jacksonians may reject certain kinds of candidates, but not because they&rsquo;re black,&#8221; Barone concluded. &#8220;A black candidate who will join them in fighting against attacks on their family or their country is all right with them.&#8221; And these results in general elections included Republicans and independents, who are more likely to vote against liberals, which makes the anti-Obama results from the Democratic primary voters &mdash; who were presumably not moved by the putative attack machine of conservative bigots &mdash; all the more striking. Obama&rsquo;s problem may be less that he is running while black than that he is running to be the first Academician elected as president, a category that is zero for eight in national contests thus far. {snip}</p>
<p>Complicating all this are the disparate facts that the voters most imbued with warrior instincts &mdash; southerners, rural voters, and many white ethnics &mdash; are those most suspected (by Newsweek) of harboring deep racial bias, and that the first credible black candidate to be running for president of the world&rsquo;s greatest power is also one of the least Jacksonian candidates who ever drew breath. The interesting counterexample of course would be to see a black Jacksonian run against a white Academician, and if Colin Powell had chosen to challenge Bill Clinton in 1996, we might have seen this take place. (Whether the black warrior could have been nominated is another whole story, as the centrism that would have made him electable would have given rise to hysterics in the party&rsquo;s activist base.) The charming, war-tested moderate Powell would have presented a fair test of whether an ultra-acceptable black candidate could have been undermined by prejudice. The charming, untested, and left wing Obama will not.</p>

<p>More inversion excepted as reality. It&rsquo;s not the republicans scaring decent folks. It&rsquo;s people of color and their educated supporters doing that all on their own. Usually browbeating them, often making fun of them, sometimes firing them, even killing them, and always ethnically cleansing them out of their new neighborhoods. </p>

			<p>Many will vote for Obama specifically because he is black.  Thus, it is perfectly reasonable for many others NOT to vote for Obama for the the same reason.  It doesn&rsquo;t take a social(ist) scientist to figure this out.</p>

			<p>Allow me to clarify one of the terms in this piece. A white Academician is someone who has never lived in close range of a large black population. So yes, it is all about race  &mdash;  on both sides.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;.voters variously known as Appalachians or Reagan Democrats, rural voters and white ethnics in the industrial states.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least, so we at the Weekly Standard have heard.  We&rsquo;ve never actually met such people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, he dispatched another Jacksonian in Hillary Clinton, who, against all expectations, emerged as a lower-to-middle-class spokesman, and all-purpose warrior queen. As a feminist and graduate of Wellesley and Yale, she was an unlikely choice to appeal to Jacksonians, but she won them over by her grit and tenacity and her stubborn refusal to give in to pressure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or because she was the only other Democrat on the ballot by then, or the only other one that they had ever heard of.</p>
<p>Never considered by the Weekly Standard - those cunning geniuses who thought that G.W. Bush would be a good President, those brave patriots who want to soldier on with &#8220;The War&#8221; (as long as they&rsquo;re not the ones actually doing the soldiering) - is that whites might rationally conclude that a black candidate with Obama&rsquo;s background is a bad bet.  Where in the world, ever, has there been a black President who was not a cretin, a crook, a beast, or all three?  Has there indeed ever been a black president who has not tried to make himself president-for-life?</p>
<p>The WS can complain about Obama all they want.  In a true sense, he is partly their creation.</p>

			<p>      Nice try, but it doesn&rsquo;t wash. In fact, it&rsquo;s<br>
dirty. McCain is not for red state White Americans.<br>
To put him in the same sentence as Andrew Jackson<br>
is to insult a very great man. He is a Neo-Con, that<br>
is to say, a Con-Man. He, like all NeoCons, mimic<br>
and make a mockery of, our history and politics.<br>
How? By claiming to be in succesion to them, but ac-<br>
tually using them for their own Class and Ethnic pur-<br>
poses; purposes quite alien to our History and current<br>
needs. Although fundamentally dishonest, to his <br>
credit he has flashes of honesty: the jobs aren&rsquo;t<br>
coming back, the more immigrants the better, and<br>
there are going to be more wars. &#8220;Bomb, bomb, bomb,<br>
bomb, bomb Iran&#8221;. Anyone White who votes for him is<br>
stone cold, stupid. Much as I hate to say it, but<br>
the Left is right about &#8220;Red State&#8221; Americans: they<br>
are fooled very easily. A little patriotic music,<br>
a few tear jerk stories and you are off to the<br>
races with these folks.</p>

			<p>Exactly,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s black, though in a white majority country he would have somthing to prove in terms of competence, but the fact that he is a ultra-socialist, black separatist, elitist fool turns people off.</p>
<p>Sorry Barry.</p>

<p><br>
Part of the problem is, even racially conscious whites are very reluctant to realize that those two things are synonymous.</p>
<p>There is this evolution I&rsquo;ve noticed to awakening to racial consciousness.  You start out denying race exists.  Then, you realize races are different and that causes friction whenever they have to coexist.  Later, you notice all the negative traits they have and you start making excuses for your &#8220;racism&#8221;.  This is where you and many racially conscious people are at.  &#8220;It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s black, it&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s &#8220;.  Usually, negative feelings about race are reserved for violent criminals (and there is alot of denial about the fact that MOST of them are violent criminals)&hellip;.except in special cases where it really matters.  Barack Obama is such a special case.  It really matters.  And he can cause incredible, possibly irreversible damage, if he is elected.  But, not all blacks are like that?  Are they?</p>
<p>I used to think that way.  But&hellip;.funny thing about racial consciousness.  More and more, you pay attention to things other people don&rsquo;t.  Like the constant themes in media and popular culture, reassuring us that race mixing is good.  Blacks are good.  Blacks get the woman. Whites are evil and impotent&hellip;.buffoons.  Then you start to notice just how much black and other racial crime there is and how determined our institutions are to cover up that fact.  And how rare it is for one of them to simply be a normal, decent human being, who cares about the community rather than looking to take from others.</p>
<p>Slowly, you come to the realization that YES, they are, in fact, ALL &#8220;like that&#8221;.  Some are able to behave themselves just as long as the threat of institutionalized justice hangs over their head.  But, if that were to disappear, boy, how their behavior would quickly change (just ask people in South Africa and Zimbabwe about that).</p>
<p>The realization I&rsquo;ve had, up to this point, is that everything we define as good, decent, wholesome and enlightened, are traits endemic to whites, and whites only. Those things exist ONLY because we are dominant (for now) in the world.  If that dominance ends, those things will disappear.  If Obama gets elected, those things will start to disappear much faster in the US then they have been for the last few decades or so.  Why?  Is it because he is a marxist psychopath?  No&hellip;.it&rsquo;s because he is a non-white.  Being a marxist psychopath is a distinction that only has meaning for whites.  As most whites are not that and only a few are that.  But for blacks, they are ALL like that.</p>
<p>That is the real issue here.  And dealing with it, requires that we first be aware of it.  Then, be honest about it.</p>

			<p>Noemie Emery is one of these neo-conservatives who rarely, if at all, venture more than a few miles outside of Washington or New York City.  Although she is partly correct in that Middle Americans despise the liberal yuppie lifestyles of Obamamaniacs with their sissy ways, Middle Americans find the uncivilized ways of the blacks very distressing and are revolted that a black may be their president.  That is all that is keeping John McCain within striking distance.</p>
<p>Middle Americans have seen the destructive powers of the blacks.  Blacks are responsible for a huge percentage of America&rsquo;s violent crime.  In the cities and suburbs, blacks have made unliveable every neighborhoood they have inhabited.  White Flight is the demographic term.  In the rural South, not only have blacks misruled every county where they have a majority, they have destroyed the public schools by their very presence.  Most Middle Americans do not vote Republican because of some love of neo-conservatism or Wall Street free markets but because they see white liberals and their black companions to be their enemies.</p>

 Poster PBL has it right. I was on a College faculty in the late 70&rsquo;s and currently work at another College although not on the faculty. Little has changed in that those who &#8220;celebrate diversity&#8221; live and work in the least diverse sectors of society and have no problem lecturing everyone within earshot of the benefits of diversity.<br>
 However, while banging the drum for this all inclusiveness, college and universities all accross the country have established segregated dorms and seperate graduations for various racial/ethnic groups. Only in the petrie dish of academia can one celebrate diversity and segregation without acknowledging the contradiction.</p>

			<p> Ms. Emery&rsquo;s two categories seem arbitrary and ridiculous. If John McCain loses it will be because of Bush&rsquo;s unpopularity, economic recession and McCain&rsquo;s faux conservatism. </p>
<p>Her statement that &#8220;The Academicians don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;evil forces&rdquo; exist, and if they did, they would want to talk to them. This, and not color, seems to be the divider statement.&#8221; This is utter nonsense. Having worked in Academia my whole life, I can say that many academics do believe in evil forces &mdash; they call them white males!  </p>

			<p>The Republican Party is going to learn this year that a Republican really CAN vote for an independent for President as the November ballot has all the major presidential candidates listed to choose from.</p>
<p>They will also have to mind that little leak in their ship that opened up costing them a few baby boomers as well as younger conservative voters. </p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the Republican party takes note of the dissatisfaction or ignores it all together.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen a conservative president run for office in the Republican party for many cycles now and some of us became independent conservatives grasping a more authentic conservate ideology from an earlier time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going back either.</p>

<p>I was going to give a stinging comback to this comment, but I realized he was right. Listing off people like Clarence Thomas, etc. does not change the truth. For example, would the Space program even Exist if this country becomes majority black? Individuals are important, but even great men need the society around them to be competent for them to suceed. What could Von Braun do with his dreams of a rocket without a industrial society to produce the alloys, the ceramics, the electronics necessary to bring the dream to fufillment? Great men can achive anything in our society BECAUSE whites are the way they are. Look at Zimbabwe and South Africa, they are unable to achive basic food production not because they don&rsquo;t know how, but because the blacks that have seized society will literally kill them if they produce. We are watching &#8220;Atlas Shrugged&#8221; play out in real time. I stand corrected.<br>

			<p>Do liberals really believe that if Dr. Thomas Sowell were the Republican candidate that Republicans, those benighted racist swine, wouldn&rsquo;t vote for him?</p>
<p>Like hell they wouldn&rsquo;t.  They&rsquo;d vote for him in droves, and not in spite of his race.  They&rsquo;d vote for him because he shares their values, their beliefs, and their religion-based moral compass.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great pity that Sowell and many others like him no longer are willing to get involved in the squalid sewer that is now American national politics. </p>

			<p>It is often claimed that Obama gains much of his support from the higher educated population.  But it is clear to me that these so-called higher educated are rather the indoctrinated.  Education, from public grade school through university has been skewed toward social indoctrination in a slightly veiled Marxist vein.</p>
<p>I would argue that the intentional revision of history and elevation of subjects such as minority studies in place of solid history studies has led to the illusion of intellectual elitism when it has only led to political elitism.</p>

<p>&gt; So very true, Jack.  In the end, it was my white skin and blue eyes that caused me to be left out of every state or federal program I ever applied.  Later, I heard non-whites make comments to me about my skin and eye color.  I was raised to be tolerant and non-racist in general.  It was life experience and honesty that led me to realize that EVERYTHING is about race.  And now, it is chiefly my white skin and blue eyes that cause me to ally myself with many who I have particular disagreements with, but recognize that when it comes down to it, we are selected by our racial identities.</p>

			<p>He&rsquo;s divided us into either rugged &#8216;Jacksonians&rsquo; or temperate &#8216;Academicians&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often said that peoples attitudes and utterances are a result of what they have experienced from others. They are &#8216;projecting&rsquo; outwardly what has been pressed inwardly onto them. </p>
<p>Liberals might take note of this and treat the white middle and working class and white men with decency, but, there&rsquo;s little chance of that. Even Obama has been turned into just another excercise of doing the opposite. </p>
<p>Then again, maybe us &#8216;Jacksonians&rsquo; just look our politics the same way we like to root for something like football. And we question those unable to at least believe in something. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think race should be discounted in this race. There&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;m going to vote for Obama, anyway. Thank God it was Obama. Not sure I could have recovered after voting for Hillary.  </p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s real WEAKNESS is that we have absolutely no reason to trust in him. Just about every Black politician rising to a high office has been a dismal failure. So on what grounds should we believe Obama&rsquo;s speeches and risk his doing incalculable harm to our economy and ultimately our country?</p>

Re The Space Program</p>
<p>obama plans to gut nasa to pay for pre-k programs.  I&rsquo;ll admit that nasa has problems, but head start&rsquo;s documented failure shows the failure of pre-k programs if a child&rsquo;s homelife is dysfunctional.</p>
<p>obama wants to cut money from the CEV program.  This will send some of our best people home while china is ramping up its space program. Whoever controls low earth orbit can easily run the planet.</p>
