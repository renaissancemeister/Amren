						<p>The Supreme Court made it easier Monday for some foreigners who overstay their visas to seek to remain in the United States legally.</p>
<p>The court ruled 5-4 Monday that someone who is here illegally may withdraw his voluntarily agreement to depart and continue to try to get approval to remain in the United States.</p>
<p>The decision essentially embraced a proposed Justice Department regulation governing the treatment of similar cases in the future.</p>
<p>Samson Dada, a Nigerian citizen, stayed beyond the expiration of his tourist visa in 1998. He married an American the following year and soon began trying to obtain a visa as an immediate relative of a citizen. But Dada and his wife apparently failed to submit some documents, causing immigration officials to deny the visa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He agreed to leave voluntarily, which would allow him to try sooner to re-enter the country legally than if he had been deported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration authorities recently ruled that Dada had entered a &#8220;sham&#8221; marriage in order to stay in the United States, but that finding was not part of the court&rsquo;s consideration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case is Dada v. Mukasey, 06-1181.<br>

			<p>If anyone is in any doubt as to how important it is that McCain be the next President and not Obama, they should look no further than the shenanigans going on recently with our supreme court.</p>
<p>If McCain is elected, this stuff will end.  If Obama is elected, it will accelerate for at least another generation.</p>
<p>It really is as simple as that.</p>

			<p>This can only be compared to making it easier, during a wild fires season, for campers and other outdorsmen to use fireworks and campfires.</p>
<p>Do the majority of the Supremes have any sense of purpose? It sure doesn&rsquo;t look like that.<br>

			<p>What is wrong with our court system or anyone of any &#8216;power&rsquo; in the U.S.? (I know they have children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.) We need leaders with rational insight about our future. </p>

			<p>Well&hellip;there is scarcely an elected official in all of Washington actually interested in the needs or desires of the American people or the country itself - why should the courts be any different. The American people have collectively abdicated all power to this government Laviathan. </p>

Judges are cloistered in their own racial cocoon. In their profession, the majority of people the see and interact with on a daily basis are white.  </p>
<p>Once in a while, they may run into an intelligent and well-spoken African-American. If they work late, they may see the Hispanic cleaning personal.</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of us, their communities aren&rsquo;t being overrun with non-English speaking Latinos hanging outside the local convenience store at all hours.</p>
<p>For them, America is still overwhelmingly white. They have no understanding of what&rsquo;s going on because they aren&rsquo;t being impacted or inconvenienced in any way. They are blissfully ignorant and naive.</p>

<p>McCain was a big backer of the illegal alien amnesty.  He said Americans wouldn&rsquo;t pick lettuce if it paid $50 an hour.  Do not expect anything good to come from a McCain presidency.  The powers that be have done their usual work to ensure we have no real choice in this election.</p>
<p>We are screwed regardless of whether McCain or Obama gets elected, so you may as well do the right thing by your conscience and vote for Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party.  He&rsquo;s the closest replacement for Ron Paul we have, and will actually be on  the ballot in most states.</p>

			<p>The Immigration Reform Act of the 1960&rsquo;s, promoted by Rep. Elmanuel Cellar of New York, increased quotas for legal immigrants from Third World sources and specifically cut West European sources.</p>
<p>With President BHO   &mdash;   (it just doesn&rsquo;t sound or read the same as FDR)   &mdash;   expect to see in his first year a new proposed law to &#8216;reform&rsquo; the law&hellip;wherein the only source for new legal immigrants will be Africa, with all other sources cut out.</p>
<p>With the invasion of America from the South, we are seeing a browning of American.</p>
<p>With Pres BHO, we will see a blackening of America.</p>
<p>But hey, the march of history is scientific according to Marxist theorists like BHO. </p>

			<p>The bottom line is that modern liberals tend to be Democrats and Democrats often have their bases of power in poverty affected areas. It is not in their political interest to end illegal immigration and public assistance for the masses living in poverty capable of working. Doing so; however, would be extremely beneficial to the national interest of the United States on many levels beyond just the great economic benefit that would result.</p>
<p>Instead what we see are dysfunctional efforts to do just the opposite. Efforts to increase visas and immigration of foreigners is being conducted to fill so-called &#8220;shortages&#8221;. </p>
<p>Modern liberals want to keep the citizens of this country living in poverty to protect their base of power while they import foreigners to do jobs that tens of millions of American citizens living in poverty should be doing.</p>
<p>Neo-conservatives support the current status quo because of their desire for the lowest possible labor cost. Neither group aligns itself with what is best for the long-term national interest of the country and its citizens.</p>
<p>But Cicero&rsquo;s observation in 55 BC is the antithesis of the modern liberal position today:</p>
<p>&#8220;The national budget must be balanced. The public debt must be reduced; the arrogance of the authorities must be moderated and controlled. Payments to foreign governments must be reduced, if the nation doesn&rsquo;t want to go bankrupt. People must again learn to work, instead of living on public assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it becomes permanent, then we&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
