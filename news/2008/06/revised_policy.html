						<p>A revised illegal-immigration policy will require Prince William County police to check the citizenship status of every person they arrest.</p>
<p>Chief Charlie Deane says it will only be mandatory after a person is actually arrested.</p>
<p>Officers will have the option of checking someone&rsquo;s immigration status if they &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; rather than &#8220;probable cause&#8221; to think the person is here illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police Chief Charlie Deane presented the revised policy Tuesday. The citizenship check for everyone arrested comes after concerns that a previous policy could have led to racial profiling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Greg Latique with the group, Help Save Manassas, which has lobbied heavily for the crackdown, believes the change will lead to more arrests of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The revised policy says no one will be arrested for the sole purpose of checking citizenship status. Also, police will retain the discretion to inquire about immigration status before an arrest.</p>
<p>Since the crackdown began in March, police have questioned 265 people about their immigration status. 0f those, 138 have been arrested.<br>

					<p>  Check everyone but why not give a real ID to everyone checked so they do not have to go through the system again ?<br>
  The plan was to check everyone, eventually.<br><br>
  There are many Indians - (Canadian,South American,and from India) who are not in the US legally, there are many illegal aliens who are Jews, Russians, Chinese, Africans, and nearly any other imaginable ethnic group and nationality have some people here illegally.<br><br>
  Remove them all because they have all committed fraud to remain and work here. Do not allow anyone who has been here illegally toreturn for any reason.<br><br>
  That would be what a real&#8221; nation of laws&#8221; must do, according to both political parties.</p>

A friend of mine was waiting at the central bus terminal in downtown Buffalo when <span class="caps">ICE </span>came in. They walked up to people and asked them, including my friend, if they were a legal resident. They didn&rsquo;t ask for ID but they did walk off with a couple asians (my friend believed they looked Chinese).</p>
<p>Not sure what was going on there.<br>

					<p>As more cities and states pass laws to combat illigal immigration you find the opposition and open border polititions repeating their same rhetoric. Im tired of hearing,&#8221;Its unconstitutional&#8221;, as if the invaders are covered by the constitution,&#8221;Its mean spirited&#8221;, as if Mexico didnt have standing immigration laws far more strict and enforced diligently, and &#8220;Its a federal issue&#8221;, as if there are NO current federal laws regarding legal and illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Laws that are enforced to combat the invasion work:<br>

					<p>It is a bit ironic, but this is a case where &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; benefits blacks. </p>
<p>Since illegal immigrants are more likely to be Hispanic than black, a policeman who engages in racial profiling would give a black the benefit of the doubt in most cases. But under this new policy, African-Americans will have to respond to a police request for proof of citizenship.</p>

					<p>From a basic, work-related perspective, this raises an obvious question  &mdash;   isn&rsquo;t profiling by definition what police, and others involved in security, are supposed to do?  Profiling is just the use of prior collected data to suggest factors that are worth noting in future screenings, not a priori accusations specifically but, rather, a collection of observable factors that help to decide whether something is worth investigation.  Sometimes it involves race and ethnicity, sometimes not  &mdash;   but when police are profiling to help prevent crimes, shouldn&rsquo;t these officials just let them do their jobs?</p>
<p>I suspect that with a Barack Obama presidency, we&rsquo;ll probably be seeing a lot more of these &#8220;counter-profiling&#8221; measures, but ironically  &mdash;   I&rsquo;m starting to think that a President Obama may be the best thing to occur for our people, the event that finally awakens us and pushes us to unify.  I have nothing against Obama himself, if anything I admire his fighting spirit and obviously, his organizational abilities.  However, the power arrangements and media framing that have have brought him to power, are the surest sign of the total lack of group identity of American whites, a fact that continues to cause us serious damage.  Election of a President Barack Hussein Obama may be the one event that finally galvanizes our people and forces the appreciation of a common group identity for us.  The problem is, we are stuck with frog-in-the-slowly-boiling-water syndrome, and someone like Hillary Clinton or John McCain would only make this worse.  Hillary in particular is treacherous and power-hungry, and she wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate for a moment to betray our people and pander to pressure groups hostile to white interests, if she thought it could earn her more votes.  McCain, meanwhile, is so beholden to political correctness that one of his first priorities would be to exacerbate our already severe impending demographic crisis, with amnesty and other measures.  Yet superficial considerations would continue to give American whites an excuse to stay in the pot of slowly boiling water  &mdash;   while election of a President Obama would make our status blatantly obvious, the one event that would push us to jump out and come together as a people.</p>
<p>I say this because we don&rsquo;t have the luxury of waiting another 4 or 5 years to acquire a group identity of common interest here.  Even without further immigration, legal even more than illegal, our demographic prospects are dismal, and the <span class="caps">USA </span>is destined for majority non-white status no later than about 2020.  For me, the canaries in the coalmine have been the shocking number of my friends and acquaintances who have been emigrating to a grouping of white countries  &mdash;   mostly Alpine and neighboring countries such as Austria, Germany, Hungary and northern Italy, or Baltic nations such as Estonia, Denmark and Finland  &mdash;   that are not only more than 95% white, but staying that way.  (German-speaking places across several countries perhaps constituting this region&rsquo;s geographical heart.)  This is largely due to immigration policies that essentially restrict inflows to ethnic Germanic peoples abroad, as well as Slavic, Baltic, Celtic and Finnish-Estonian peoples with some ancestral connection to the countries.  My friends, unsurprisingly, want to raise their kids in Western lands, and considering the dismal demographic prospects here, as well as in Canada, Sweden, Russia, the UK and Australia, they&rsquo;re doing whatever they have to  &mdash;   seeking employment abroad, learning German, obtaining overseas contacts  &mdash;   and moving their families across the Atlantic.  That want to maintain their integrity as a people, hence the mass movement to countries that better respect this natural impulse.  Moreover, while some are highly-educated engineers, scientists and entrepreneurs, most are just hard-working service employees or blue-collar workers, artisans with skills of some kind, who just want to do a good job, take pride in their work and their civilization, and raise their kids thus.  They can glimpse the demographic future here, and unless American whites acquire some kind of group consciousness soon, then we&rsquo;ll likely have little choice but to follow them ourselves when the country changes irrevocably, to become a very different nation.</p>

					<p>This actually wont change anything since, if police check every person they arrest, the vast majority of deportations will be of &#8220;hispanic&#8221; or &#8220;latino&#8221; looking people. This will lead the leftists to conclude that it is all still some form of profiling. Here in a border state where I live some group or another protests &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; every few months because the <span class="caps">ICE </span>guys run checkpoints near the border and, surprise, the majority of those captured are Mexican Nationals.</p>

					<p>Since many liberals claim there is no such thing as race, that it is just some sort of &#8216;social fabrication&rsquo;, how then is it even possible to engage in racial profiling?</p>

<p>Oh, my naive friend Hugo. You don&rsquo;t really think that this Orwellian super ID will be required of illegal aliens, do you? They will certainly be allowed to continue to use their flimsy martricula consular. The Real ID will only be for citizen-slaves like us.</p>

					<p>Since the majority of illegals are &#8220;Latinos&#8221; and the majority of &#8220;Latinos&#8221; are illegals, there is enough statistical correlation between &#8220;Latino&#8221; and illegal to warrant treating &#8220;Latinos&#8221; as suspected illegals. In other words, from purely mathematical pont of view, &#8220;Latino&#8221; profiling while enforcing imigration laws makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Now, the anti-profiling restrictions that we have been witnessing during this decade does not just obstruct effective immigration enforcement; it imposes legal doctrine that goes against facts and reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that:</p>
<p>1. the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Constitution generally does not protect illegal aliens against &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; searches, and</p>
<p>2. <i>suspecting</i> someone of criminal act based on suspect&rsquo;s race, language, or country of origin (as opposed to <i>punishing</i> or <i>denying rights</i> based on any of the above) is not discrimination in the sense of the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>This makes the anti-profiling restrictions, in addition to being absurd, unconstitutional as well.<br>

					<p>I have a friend that is a policeman. By my association with him I got to know other policemen &amp; women. Believe me, racial profiling still exists and it is a valuable tool in the preventive sense of crime control. If the police want to stop you, they will find a way. He said that around 70% of the early morning stops on blacks lead to an arrest. They either don&rsquo;t have insurance, driver&rsquo;s liscense, are intoxicated, high and possibly may have outstanding warrants. The thing is that when stopped, most of them don&rsquo;t have the good sense to keep their mouths shut and just do what the officer asks. This will eventually lead to a resisting charge and an automobile search. Sometimes the police find drugs, mostly crack cocaine and at times a gun in these searches. I say keep up the good work to all the law enforcement agencies across the country. All these bleeding heart liberals need to experience the joys of close association with some of these minorities. Perhaps they would then gain a different perspective on law enforcement.</p>

					<p>When Barry Osama becomes Bwana-in-chief his goon squads will use this law or those like it, to systematically identify and arrest gun owners. If you are male, white, educated and not afraid to go to sleep at night, you make the profile and they will hassle you. When Mugabe took over he confiscated guns of whites, this would have happened in South Africa but the Zulus wouldn`t tolerate it. We are for the most part trash and not pure blooded Christians like the Zulus. We will tolerate warrantless searches and torture if it serves the purpose of order. Obama has spent 8 years learning how to control dissent . Bush/Cheney taught him well.<br>

					<p>&#8216;Racial profiling&rsquo; is only an issue in print if it can turn non-whites into victims or make whites look evil. For whites who live in a black or mixed neighborhood, for example, any white man simply in a car with a black woman is considered a potential-john. White teenagers passing by? potential drug buyers. Who can forget the shameful police failure in the Jeffrey Dahlmer case? As someone who used to live in a mixed neighborhood, trust me, city police did not forget. And as long as the media tells us the profile of sex offenders is white and male, profiling sex offenders will not be a sensitive issue. </p>
<p>Frankly, I wonder if what has Really been going on during the last 15 years &#8216;racial profiling&rsquo; has been an issue, is that the authorities have been gathering information on or watching white men. It would fit the usual pattern. The usual disconnect between what the news covers and what is really happening.  </p>

					<p>Charles: If Washington thought for one minute they could repeal the Second Amendment they would have done so ages ago.  There are over 70 million civilian riflemen in this country and all the armies of the world combined can not field that many riflemen.  Obama is nothing more than a puppet and his masters know that any attempt to disarm Americans will place them at the top of the disposal list.  In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed people are beginning to wake up and see things as they really are and they don&rsquo;t like what they see one bit&hellip;</p>
