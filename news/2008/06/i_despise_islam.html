<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The novelist Ian McEwan has launched an astonishingly strong attack on Islamism, saying that he &#8220;despises&#8221; it and accusing it of &#8220;wanting to create a society that I detest&#8221;. His words, in an interview with an Italian newspaper, could, in today&rsquo;s febrile legalistic climate, lay him open to being investigated for a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>In an interview with Guido Santevecchi, a London correspondent for Corriere della Sera, the Booker-winning novelist said he rarely grants interviews on controversial issues &#8220;because I have to be careful to protect my privacy&#8221;. But he said that he was glad to leap to the defence of his old friend Martin Amis when the latter&rsquo;s attacks on Muslims brought down charges of racism on his head. He made an exception of the Islamic issue out of friendship to Amis, and because he shares the latter&rsquo;s strong opinions.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dear friend had been called a racist,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As soon as a writer expresses an opinion against Islamism, immediately someone on the left leaps to his feet and claims that because the majority of Muslims are dark-skinned, he who criticises it is racist.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is logically absurd and morally unacceptable. Martin is not a racist. And I myself despise Islamism, because it wants to create a society that I detest, based on religious belief, on a text, on lack of freedom for women, intolerance towards homosexuality and so on &mdash; we know it well.&#8221;</p>
<p>McEwan &mdash; author of On Chesil Beach and the acclaimed Atonement and Enduring Love &mdash; has spoken on the issue of Islamism before, telling The New York Times last December: &#8220;All religions make very big claims about the world, and it should be possible in an open society to dispute them. It should be possible to say, &lsquo;I find some ideas in Islam questionable&rsquo; without being called a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his words in the Corriere interview are far stronger, although they do fall short of the invective deployed by Martin Amis. He has said &#8220;the Muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order&#8221;, and told The Independent&rsquo;s columnist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, a Muslim, in an open letter: &#8220;Islamism, in most of its manifestations, not only wants to kill me &mdash; it wants to kill you.&#8221;</p>
<p>McEwan&rsquo;s interviewer pointed out that there exist equally hard-line schools of thought within Christianity, for example in the United States. &#8220;I find them equally absurd,&#8221; McEwan replied. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like these medieval visions of the world according to which God is coming to save the faithful and to damn the others. But those American Christians don&rsquo;t want to kill anyone in my city, that&rsquo;s the difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>But McEwan&rsquo;s specific irritation is reserved for those who find ideological grounds to condemn his and Amis&rsquo;s views. &#8220;When you ask a novelist or a poet about his vision regarding an aspect of the world, you don&rsquo;t get the response of a politician or a sociologist, but even if you don&rsquo;t like what he says you have to accept it, you can&rsquo;t react with defamation. Martin is not a racist, and neither am I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview McEwan serenely predicted the Balkanisation of the United Kingdom. &#8220;Great Britain is an artificial construction of three or four nations. I&rsquo;m waiting for the Northern Irish to unite with the Irish Republic sooner or later, and also Scotland could go its own way and become independent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does the prospect disturb him? &#8220;No,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I think that at this point we should start to reflect on Englishness: this is the country of Shakespeare, of Milton, Newton, Darwin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;<br>

			<p>The first time I&rsquo;d ever heard of Ian McEwan was in 1989.  He was giving an interview on Television and he said something I have never forgotten, and have often used it myself since.  He said, words to the effect that, people who can not stand to be criticized create a sort of &#8220;Myth of Innocence&#8221; where they never do anything wrong - things are done to them.  And that when you do that, you never learn, you never grow.</p>
<p>A group or two came to mind immediately.  But they weren&rsquo;t the Muslims, or the Christians.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you realize by now that you can NEVER criticize anything, religion, behavior etc. that is practiced by non-whites??? It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they stone rape victims, marry 9-year-olds, lop off a few heads,etc., they&rsquo;re non-white, they can do no wrong. They&rsquo;re wonderful people who just happen to have a different culture and you&rsquo;re just an intolerant, narrow-minded bigot if you don&rsquo;t approve.</p>

			<p>I also despise Islamism, which calls for the revival of the religion and the return of Islam to power(world power). Unlike the fundamentalists believed; 9/11 did not scare the U.S. from Islamic lands, convince more Muslims to join, or produce Afghanastan as the only pure Islamic state. The &#8216;Islamic world&rsquo; did not rise up.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s &#8216;progress&rsquo; to UNIVERSALITY is no progress. (I don&rsquo;t want Obama&rsquo;s quasi-Marxist beliefs enforced. I do not believe the Qur&rsquo;an is for all humanity for all time.)</p>

			<p>I guess you still have a modicum of freedom if you criticize &#8220;Islamism&#8221; rather than &#8220;Islam&#8221;. I suppose the first is more or less a misdemeanor and the latter a felony.</p>
<p>While I can&rsquo;t fault anyone for speaking out in a so tightly thought-controlled country as the UK but nonetheless it bothers me that McEwan feels the need to whine that he isn&rsquo;t &#8220;racist&#8221;. If say all the Somalians or Pakistanis in London converted to Christianity it wouldn&rsquo;t really change a heck of a lot, they would still tranform England to resemble their respective third world slums from which they came, and ultimately rot out and destroy the country.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t like the Islamic faith either, I know it all to well in all of its guises. It is repressive, oppressive and depressive and would have the entire world back in the 6th century if it could. It is abusive of women and free thinkers and has an untouchable clan of elite rulers, mostly Saudis of the Whabii sect which are the more fundamentalist of the rotten bunch.</p>

<p>Though I don&rsquo;t know precisely what is needed in these times, I have enough of an idea to know that Taylor&rsquo;s efforts could not by any interpretation be considered less than essential.</p>

			<p>After seven hundred years of struggle for Ireland for the Irish, Ireland is admitting refugees and immigrants from Africa.<br>
Let&rsquo;s just keep working on diversity of English, Irish, Scots and Welsh. There is still enough work to do here.</p>

Cheers, Mr. McEwan, and bravo! Your comments make me more interested in reading one of your books, or finally watching the movie &#8220;Atonement&#8221; (which I understand is really good, even if it did win Oscars). </p>
<p>But   &mdash;   as others have pointed out   &mdash;   we should distinguish between Islamism and Islam. </p>
<p>Like Mr. McEwan, I too despise Islamism. </p>
<p>Islam, I merely dislike. <br>

			<p>I have to agree.  Though I do think that your comment about Mr. Taylor is a bit of a misrepresentation.</p>
<p>All of the talk about Genetics from Mr. Taylor to his learned friends Rushton and Lynn loses its punch by seeming to focus exclusively on how limited Blacks are.</p>
<p>Personally, though my principle concern is with Whites, it isn&rsquo;t limited to them.  I am on the side of anyone concerned about living in Reality.  That is what attracts me to all of the Realist movements, as in Race Realism, Immigration Realism, Environmental Realism (is there an Environmental Realism Movement?).  </p>
<p>And the one more I always add is Social Realism.  But not as in &#8220;Socialist&#8221;, intellectually and morally Socialism is unacceptable to me.  I am interested in an open dialogue on HOW and WHERE we are Socialized, something both the Right and the Left miss the boat on completely, in my view.  We are Socialized in the Family and the Family is influenced by its Culture.  The totality of these Institutions and the Relationships between the parts is what I would prefer to discuss.  For this reason all talk that focuses on Society, Genetics, Race, Class, Economics, etc. miss the point, which is considerably more subtle.<br>
This is why Family Systems is so useful.  In any event, all of the different approaches listed above need to be brought together – which I believe was the original purpose of the University – and studied as parts to a whole.  That way we can have a better idea of how they work, as a result of studying their relationships.  Not arguing over which approach is the best.  Once we do that, the sublte point I mentioned will begin to emerge from all of the talk and we will have a comprehension of Behavior like never before.<br>
