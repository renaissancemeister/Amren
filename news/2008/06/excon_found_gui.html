<h1>Excon Found Guilty of Torturing NYC Grad Student</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Samuel Maull, AP, June 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Robert Williams was pronounced guilty in a Manhattan courtroom of 44 of 46 counts.</p>
<p>The verdict followed a gruesome trial that included dramatic testimony from the victim. She identified her attacker down to his scars and gold tooth and tearfully recalled how the attack was so agonizing that she begged him to kill her.</p>

			<p>Disgusting. You have to read the original article, or rather here is the excerpt which made me ill.</p>
<p>&#8220;She also said the 31-year-old Williams made her swallow fistfuls of painkillers, ordered her to gouge out her eyes with scissors, sealed her lips with super glue, and gagged her with duct tape before torching her apartment. She spent weeks in hospitals and required months of physical therapy.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was forced to gouge out her eyes?! How can it be that there are such individuals? It is below animal.</p>
<p>&#8220;O wonder!<br>
How many goodly creatures are there here!<br>
How beauteous mankind is!<br>
O brave new world<br>
That hath such people in&rsquo;t!&#8221;<br>

			<p>  I assume from the thug&rsquo;s name, the fact that one of his identifying marks was &#8220;gold tooth,&#8221; and the fact that no photo of him was included, that he is black. Of course the newspaper kept his victim&rsquo;s identity confidential as is the custom with rape victims, but I&rsquo;d bet anything that she was White.</p>
<p>  Now just imagine if Williams had been White, and his victim black. Do you think for one minute that the newspaper would have been satisfied with this short, perfunctory little stub of a story? Would not the story have also included a large, suitably horrifying picture of the Caucasian fiend, preferably snarling at a his guards or some such? Ah, yes, boys and girls, things would have been much, much different if the situations were reversed.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s it? This is all they could report? What a joke! </p>
<p>It is interesting how they write out &lsquo;Excon&rsquo; to make it somehow synonymous with Exxon the oil company.  I guess they are trying to kill two birds with one stone. Perhaps the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision to reduce Exxon&rsquo;s liability damages today enraged the left to the point of delusion. The Exxon disaster is nothing compared to what happened to this woman.</p>
<p>This is outrageous! I truly hope Whites wake up, and wake up soon!!<br>

			<p>From the original story posted on AmRen, June 9th: &#8220;Then 23, she said no alarm bells went off when she spotted the stranger in the elevator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course no alarm went off. No doubt she had been taught that to feel aprehension around a black male was a sign of racism. All it cost her by ignoring her instincts was to be brutally raped and tortured by this african and it almost cost her her life. </p>
<p>It is my belief that many white women are victims of black attacks for this very reason. Ignore the fact that they see black after black brought before a judge(local news)for rape murder, assault, etc, and act like being alone with a black male is harmless. But the women in my life dont have this problem. I have made sure over the years that they fully understand the dangers of being near blacks. And they avoid them like the plague.</p>

			<p>Big Headline stories about Black torture and murder cases bare strong similarities between one another.<br>
The Witchita Massacres, the torture murders of Christopher Newsom and Shannon Christian, and the latest case involving the New York student all share aspects of rape, chemical inducement, or torture.<br>
Torture killings by blacks against whites seem to continue especially among blacks who have been imprisoned and have tried every devious crime short of murder.<br>
Americans have to vote for a candidate who will Obey constitutional law like Ron Paul is stating now.</p>

			<p>This outrageous case is right in line with two earlier cases.  The so-called Wichita Horror and the Knoxville Outrage.  The main thing that ties these three cases together is the lack of media coverage because the perps were all black.  <br>
 <br>
As you&rsquo;ve probably already read, there was and is almost a complete news blackout on these cases. We all know that if the races had been reversed with the whites being the perps, it would still be headline news. </p>
<p>It seems that all of the media is involved in this conspiracy to only present blacks as upstanding citizens, devoted parents and community leaders when we all know the truth?  </p>

			<p>In 2005, there were over 36,000 black on white rapes in the US.</p>
<p>In that same year, there were less than ten white on black rapes.  It&rsquo;s a crime that virtually never happens.  2005 was also the year of the Duke Rape Case debacle.</p>
<p>In 2005, blacks commited 50% of the approximately 144,000 rapes in the US.  They are only 12% of the population.  But under no circumstances are you supposed to notice of even acknowledge that they are a people apart from the rest of humanity by virtue of their general lack of virtue.</p>

<p>She probably didn&rsquo;t have a choice. A small one bedroom apartment in  a safe Manhattan neighborhood in NYC goes for around two grand a month. People that imply that the victim in this case is a &#8220;race mixer&#8221; or whatever for living in Harlem are obnoxious, it is hard for young people living in NY to afford a decent place to live. </p>
<p>I live with two roommates for an apartment in a reasonably safe area but it is hard to get by if you are just starting out in life and only making 25 or 30k a year or so.</p>

<p>Nonsense. If the races were reversed,  and the  torture rapist was white and the victim black, he would have been charged with a hate crime and it would have been all over the national news for 10 years like the James Byrd case. The men in the Duke rape case were NOT rapists and  the evidence  and forensics clearly showed that they were not. Again, if the Duke men had been black and the stripper white, they NEVER would have been charged in the first place and there would have been no news.</p>

			<p>I am an ex-con as well, but I would rather die myself than hurt an innocent young woman, or see one hurt in the way this one was.</p>
<p>I used to go get my mail at night when I came home from federal prison, just so my neighbors wouldn&rsquo;t see me.  The first words the retired CIA agant across the street said to me were &#8220;You f  &mdash;  -ing felon.&#8221;  He&rsquo;s a friend now.</p>
<p>Being an ex-con isn&rsquo;t bad.  I can&rsquo;t shoot firearms anymore, but that&rsquo;s OK, too.  I did plenty of shooting, and the last firearm I shot was a Bren gun in .303&#8221;.</p>
<p>Good or evil comes from within.</p>
<p>The aweful man who hurt this young woman will pay for the rest of his life.  He won&rsquo;t be able to go fishing or even drive over to a friend&rsquo;s house for smoked bass, or teach his kids to skip stones across a lake.  He won&rsquo;t be able to take a shower with his wife when she had a bad day at work and then make her a nice dinner, before they make love.  He&rsquo;s just done.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t be able to experiment with chile recepies, and he won&rsquo;t be able to do anything except wait to die.</p>
<p>I wish his victim was here, so I could tell that beautiful young lady how much the future holds.</p>

<p>Having worked in a prison I can pretty much guarantee he will also get fine food, sex, drugs, music and probably even conjugal visits from stupid white woman who will fall in love with him. I&rsquo;ve seen these things in only a year I worked in one and that was enough.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this logic before. Wait! That&rsquo;s right I have black employees working for me. The Duke Rape case was all over the news and, as mentioned above, fabricated by the black victim. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only guessing that Pharell is black based on the grammar, the name and the logic. Pharell &hellip; am I right?</p>
<p>Trust me, it will do no good to point of the fallacy of his argument. He will still think that he made a good point!</p>

			<p>&#8220;If it had been a White men raping a Black woman it would not have even made the news and the rapist would have gotten off scot free. Look at the Duke Rape case.&#8221;</p>
<p>This case is an excellent example of why there were a few black lynchings years ago.  Witnessing nowadays the complete crush of black on white tortures, murders, assaults, rapes, and cowardly mob beatings, does anybody really believe lynchings years ago weren&rsquo;t justification for black atrocities against whites?</p>
<p>The only differences between now and then is that there used to be courageous whites who protected their people, instead of the wimpish lot that stands by now while their women are raped and their children assaulted and murdered by blacks.</p>
<p>I doubt that there&rsquo;s a black in this country today who hates slavery even half as much as an aware white.  The reason, of course, is that without a small fraction of the population owning these evil miscreants years ago, they wouldn&rsquo;t be in our country today, and we would suffer about 50% less crime, our schools would be far better, and the economy would be able to chug along much easier without having to provide for a faction that hasn&rsquo;t the required intelligence to care for themselves.</p>
<p>It is whites who need reparations for slavery, because it is whites who have suffered the horrendous effects of having these people set loose on their society who have no business outside of their primal village surroundings in Africa.</p>

 This is a skirmish, in an undeclared war on whites, and so was the massacre in wichita and the knoxville incident and a million other &#8216;incidents&rsquo;, we have only so much time and we will be a unable to even slightly control our own destiny!<br>

<p>Maybe he&rsquo;ll have his sentences all run concurrently, but I&rsquo;ve been there and I doubt it.  He took the case to trial, and a judge will kick you where the sun don&rsquo;t shine if you take a case like this to trial and lose.</p>
<p>On a 44 count conviction out of 46 felony charges, the best this perp can hope for is the statutory maximum for the most serious of his 44 convictions.</p>
<p>The only way this idiot was ever going to get out was if he took a plea deal.</p>
<p>Even if he gets out someday, he&rsquo;ll be too old for even Viagra to help.</p>
<p>Like I said, this one isn&rsquo;t coming back.</p>

			<p>Ever notice how the most atrocious, most utterly loathsome and despicable crimes usually are perpetrated by Blacks? No matter whether we&rsquo;re talking about the U.S. of A. or those horror stories emanating Out of Africa.</p>
<p>Guess poor Mr. Williams was just acting out his frustrations over many-times removed ancestors of his having to serve as slaves or some such nonsense. Now just what might Mugabwe&rsquo;s excuses possibly be?</p>

			<p>Oh let there come a day in America when punishment is swift and sure. These repeat felons that are released and continue to commit violence toward innocent people do not need a return trip to the penitentiary with 3 meals a day, weight lifting to make them even more powerful to deal with when they get out, air conditioning, television and movies, basketball. NO! If they commit another crime, DEATH  &mdash;  swift and sure!! Call this extreme but consider what happened to that innocent young woman who is now scarred for life at the hands of a monster and tell me why he needs to be kept alive one more minute??</p>

			<p>The only way that this situation will be resolved or at least brought to light is the day that some politician White or Black has the stones to come out and say what everyone already knows and that is that the greatest threat to our security in this society is an entire generation of consciousless, brutal and totally out of control young black males. The reason for their present condition is obvious and has nothing to do with slavery, or Jim Crow or real or imagined White racism. It has to do with the total lack of a moral compass which is instilled in most children by means of responsable parenting. Why is it that young Jewish males are not roaming the streets of our cities vicitmizing people. Does anyone remember a case of gang rape of a woman by Jewish males or gangs of young Jews running through the streets assaulting and looting? Using the reasoning of the apologists for Black behavior we could argue that Jews should be the most violent and dangerous people in the world.</p>
<p>White people are racists in the true definition of the word i.e. attributing negative characteristics to a particular race. This perception is the result of years of observed behavior and in many cases the result of Whites having fallen victim to Black violence. A look at the conditions in Africa makes it almost impossible not to have a negative perception.  The people presently living in Africa were not enslaved by White people nor were they the objects of persecution by Whites. If we want to use the era of Apartheid in S. Africa as an example of persecution, then one has to compare the condition of today&rsquo;s Blacks in S. Africa. One could conlcude that they are no better off today than they were under Apartheid and in fact in many cases worse.<br>
The only psersecution that Blacks in Africa suffer today comes from their own Black leaders or by their Arab overlords as in the case of the Sudan.</p>
<p>Did anyone see the UTube video of the Black guy in Philadelphia waving his semi-auto and talking about how he wants to kill Policemen and encouraging other Blacks to do the same; evne offering suggestions as to bullet placement for the maximum desired effect. He had his twelve year old son film him. So much for father figures!<br>
It&rsquo;s all coming to your block. Be prepared to stand and fight!</p>

			<p>Demonic. Demonic. Absolutely Demonic. I thought it would be hard to beat the Christian/Newman murders or the Wichita Massacre. But this one might be worse. <br>
My mind flails wordlessly, helpless to find words to describe this straight from Hell Horror. My soul spins even beginning to imagine what it must be like for the parents of this girl. <br>
Normal capital punishment does not begin to do justice to the victim. <br>
After some effort, however, I did finally come up with a suitable punishment. I say it not with anger, or hate or passion. It is just the only thing that somehow may cleanse our souls and the planet of this loathsome creature from Hell. <br>
He must be tied to a stake and then burned alive, in a public square, after a description of the crime is read out loud. The girl and/or her parents can choose to personally touch off the blaze. The event must be recorded on film, to be shown to others who might be starting down the same path. <br>
I am a loving, rational, civilized man yet this is the only possible answer to such behavior. He must be burned alive to ashes, till no trace remains and the wind blows the dust away. </p>

			<p>She is on the waiting list for a liver transplant.  He made her swallow several bottles of over the counter tylenol etc medications.  With such a quantity of drugs being processed through her liver all it once, the liver was destroyed and she needs a new one.</p>
<p>Among other injuries.</p>
<p>I wonder what the anti white Columbia professors have been doing through all this.  I have seen nothing of any support or sympathy for the victim by the school located in the heart of harlem darkness.</p>
<p>But at least the marxist professors have not begged for clemency for the monster.</p>

			<p>Expect much, much more of this if Obama is elected. The government dependent blacks see Obama&rsquo;s election as a total suspension of criminal laws where blacks are concerned. We hear this attitude weekly down here. They are just waiting for the rules, in their minds, to be lifted. </p>
<p>This was confirmed a few weeks ago when a man called into the John Gibson radio show and said, and I paraphrase, &#8220;John, you white people just can&rsquo;t stand the thought that a black man will be in charge. When Obama is elected it ain&rsquo;t gonna&rsquo; be no more &#8220;Yes, Mr. White Man, no Mr. White Man. Things are gonna&rsquo; be reversed.&#8221; John still plays that clip at least once a week. </p>
<p>Our country is in a Heck of a fix. I don&rsquo;t know which is going to be worse. The riots if Obama loses or the rampant crime if he wins. Either way, we&rsquo;re screwed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;She is on the waiting list for a liver transplant.&#8221;</p>
<p>It turns out that she won&rsquo;t need a liver transplant. If she had needed one, they should have forcibly taken her attacker&rsquo;s liver(if it was compatible and matched} and given to the victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be tied to a stake and then burned alive, in a public square, after a description of the crime is read out loud.&#8221; </p>
<p>Agreed, normally I wouldn&rsquo;t but I make an exception in extreme cases like this one. </p>

			<p>I thought I should clarify one thing about my earlier post:<br>
It is precisely because I AM a loving, rational, civilized man that I feel the only moral response to such hideous Evil is to burn him alive after reading a description of his crimes. <br>
It is because I feel and care so much for the innocent that I see it is a moral neccesity to erase such Evil from the planet in such an unequivical fashion. <br>
Finally, we must all remember the other criminals involved, his accomplices; LIBERALISM. Liberalism is the door to evil. It gave birth to it, fed it, clothed it, nurtured it, protected it. The creature is the Son of Liberalism, the greatest mass mental sickness ever seen on planet earth. <br>
It was liberals who paid poor, irresponsible, stupid people to have MORE Children. It was liberalism who drove the father from the home. It was liberalism that said there is no God, no morality, no absolute laws that govern man and the Universe. Liberalism has taught that &#8220;If it feels good do it&#8221;. THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT THAT CREATURE WAS DOING. He IS the Child of Liberalism and there are millions more. <br>
Arm yourselves. Be brave. Be prepared. Do not yield. </p>

			<p>Foxnews.com has rightly covered this story and trial and I commend them.  Fox also covered the coed murders extensively, it&rsquo;s a start but the other media are clearly anti-white and agenda-driven.</p>

<p>Brazilianization and Balkanization do seem to be the choices facing America.  Unfortunately the former is the default result I think, unless we push her into Balkanization instead.</p>

			<p>Thinking about it some more, the poor gal can have my liver.    My liver is 42.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t need anesthesia.  A rag stuffed in my mouth would probably work after I am tied down. Someone could cut my eyes out and set me on fire when the procedure is done.</p>
