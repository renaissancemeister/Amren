<h1><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D913ALOG0&amp;show_article=1">Rice, Bush Congratulate Obama</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Lee, AP, June 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Secretary of State Condolezza Rice, the highest-ranking black member of the Bush administration, congratulated Barack Obama Wednesday on his history-making achievement in securing the Democratic presidential nomination. </p>
<p>White House spokeswoman Dana Perino also extended President Bush&rsquo;s congratulations. <br>
Obama on Tuesday gathered enough delegates to seize the nomination, becoming the first black candidate ever to lead his party toward the White House. He bested Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, capping a primary fight that was originally expected to end months ago. </p>
<p>Speaking at the State Department, Rice said: &#8220;The United States of America is an extraordinary country. It is a country that has overcome many, many, now years, decades, actually a couple of centuries of trying to make good on its principles. And I think what we are seeing is an extraordinary expression of the fact that &#8216;We the people&rsquo; is beginning to mean all of us.&#8221; </p>

			<p>And many &#8220;conservatives&#8221; have said they would vote for Condi if she ever ran!  Stupid is as stupid does. She isn&rsquo;t any different than Obama and 99.9% of Blacks. If this is going to be a precedent then America is lost forever. </p>
<p>The next election and the next and the next will see even more blacks, Mexicans, Arabs, etc as President and they will fill up Congress. And they say demographics won&rsquo;t change a country! Thanks Ted Kennedy and Jacob Javits and Emanuel Cellar!!!What foolish, foolish White people we now have after all the indoctrination of &#8220;we are all the same&#8221; and it sure has taken the desired outcome on our youth, hasn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			<p>&ldquo;And I think what we are seeing is an extraordinary expression of the fact that &lsquo;We the people&rsquo; is beginning to mean all of us.&rdquo; </p>
<p>So says Comrade Rice. </p>
<p>The one mistake that the Founding Fathers made, was not specifying that &ldquo;We the people&rdquo; only meant white European people.</p>
<p>They never could have envisioned this idiocy we are living through today, because they knew what they were about, with a near inspired certainty. Thus, their error is understandable; however, I wish God had granted them the insight to realize that what is known during a particular day, can not just be forgotten, but also trampled upon.</p>
<p>This country, the country that so many brave English colonists who became the first Americans died to create and escape tyranny, is being systematically destroyed in the name of a false religion, diversity. It is sad and appalling, and it can yet can be turned around, but that is the hard reality here today in 2008.</p>
<p>Even if Comrade Obama is defeated, we will still have a member of the Cult in the White House. Thus, our fight will go on; we must brace ourselves for another 4 years at best of mediocrity, and at worst a blackout of utter Marxism and multiculturalism gone berserk.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all! </p>

<p>Why is it so difficult to be gracious with success?</p>

<p>What a terrible slap in the face for the United States. Apparently this country was not a democracy but a hypocrisy for the great bulk of its history. Not something to be proud of, but something to be ashamed of. How can you feel proud of and ennobled by your ancestors&rsquo; history if they were nothing but a bunch of bigots? But this is exactly what she&rsquo;s saying. This is exactly what the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement inevitably leads to. You can&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re on the &#8220;right course&#8221; now unless you think we were horribly on the wrong course in the past. So forget all those pre-1960s monuments to &#8220;supposedly &#8220;great men. They were all part of the same &#8220;plot.&#8221; Forget the history books that cover anything before 1960. They celebrate a fundamentally flawed country. Our ancestors were not basically good people. They were something to be ashamed of, not proud of.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Condi: Obama victory shows &ldquo;&lsquo;We the people&rsquo; is beginning to mean all of us.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Why ddn&rsquo;t &#8220;We the people&#8221; mean all of us before to this biased woman?  I mean blacks have always had everything that whites have had these last several years.  That they haven&rsquo;t been able to field a qualified candidate is the fault of no one but their own.  There were plenty of white Afrophiles who would have voted for Colin Powell, just because he was black.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that the only way the vast majority of blacks would EVER accept this country is if they felt they were running things and were being awarded high paying positions they weren&rsquo;t qualified for, plus they have to be given reparations, freebies for this, freebies for that.  All because of discrimination and slavery 150 years ago. Ya see whut ah mean? Ah mean thas onny fair.</p>
<p>Then when blacks are in office everywhere, and they each have a $50,000 cash pay out, are driving a Rolls, with their little morons being tutored by private teachers at taxpayers expense, they might loosen up a bit and say that for the first time in their lives they&rsquo;re really proud of their country.  Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Their selfishness and lack of gratitude knows no bounds.<br>

			<p>So according to Rice the fact that Obama is the Democratic candidate shows that the US – after a hypocritic &#8220;couple of centuries&#8221; – is &#8220;BEGINNING&#8221; to be truthful and acceptable – and what does this insinuate? – America will only become a wonderland of diversity if – well, if her own party loses in November.</p>

<p>Tim, this country is not, nor has it ever been a democracy.  It is a Republic.  I am very proud of my ancestry, because no where in the Bible does it say that bigotry is a sin or that I have to be tolerant of anything.</p>

			<p>To Tim in Indiana,</p>
<p>You nailed it!</p>
<p>According to the diversity religion, our grand-fathers and great-grand-fathers and ancestors down the line were ignorant, frothing at the mouth men to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but I don&rsquo;t buy that for a moment.  Our grand-parents for entertainment and enjoyment spent much of their time visiting with friends and neighbors.  They weren&rsquo;t constantly plugged into TV (most didn&rsquo;t have one) ipods, etc.  I believe they probably understood human nature far better than most people today do.  And I think they were by far way more moral and upright.  Heck, today it&rsquo;s almost forbidden to even use &#8220;Christmas&#8221; in advertisements anymore, yet back then if you didn&rsquo;t go to Church, people thought something was wrong with you.  Anyways, my point is, our grand parents and ancestors were light years more intuned to human nature, social interaction and were moral, hard-working good people.</p>

<p>This is ironic since Condi does not seem to know too much about the constitution. </p>

			<p>People here missed it. By congratulating Obama, Rice and Bush were attempting to soften the difference in the voter&rsquo;s minds between McCain and Obama, in a &#8220;we&rsquo;re-all-happy-about-this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, it was a political move to help McCain cut into various Obama voter blocks.</p>
<p>The problem is, the election of either one will harm the country.</p>
<p>Write in Ron Paul on the November ballot, or vote for Libertarian Bob Barr. (All we can do now is protest).</p>

<p>In other words, it was a political move to help McCain cut into various Obama voter blocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.  McCain is almost as liberal as Clinton so there&rsquo;s not need to soften the few differences that exist.  <br>
With the Bush administration winding down and the end of her job, this is just Rice getting more bold and speaking out about what she really thinks; &#8220;I&rsquo;m gonna tell it like it is no matter what you crackas think&#8221;.  Remember, she made a &#8220;victim speech&#8221; last month that was posted on here.   </p>
<p>Looking at exit polls of people who say they would never vote for Obama and the proliferation of websites like &#8220;Democrats for McCain&#8221;, it looks like a landslide for McCain. Even Moveon.org had a petition on their website to pressure the party to accept the popular vote in choosing the candidate that would have favored Clinton.   </p>

			<p>I watched a political show last Thursday night, in the UK, and they had two Black women, Diane Abbott, a hypocritical former Labour MP, and June Sarpong, a Z list celebrity TV presenter, who is married to/cohabiting with a Labour MP.  The way that these two were gushing and fawning about Barak Obama, and even more so, his wife, was, quite frankly embarassing. </p>

			<p>This statement gives the lie to the notion that comments about the US &#8220;One-and-a-half party system&#8221; are actually jokes.</p>
<p>This election will be every bit as productive as a quarrel over whether to accept &#8220;Minute Made&#8221; or &#8220;Tropicana&#8221; orange juice with breakfast, when what we really want is a cup of coffee.</p>
