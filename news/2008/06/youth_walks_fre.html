<h1>Youth Walks Free After Gang Attack on Priest</h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzy Austin, Metro (London), June 24, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A drunken teenager who beat up a priest walked free yesterday after the judge accepted the attack was a &lsquo;one-off mistake&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Babul Islam was one of three Asian youths who attacked Canon Michael Ainsworth in his churchyard.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old punched the vicar in the head while others kicked him, one allegedly shouting &lsquo;f*****g priest&rsquo;, only stopping when passers-by intervened.</p>
<p>His battered victim spent nearly two weeks in hospital after the assault, which prosecutor Carl May-Smith said &lsquo;had a profound effect on him&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The shop assistant admitted being extremely drunk during the attack but denied it was religiously-motivated, a claim upheld by Judge Glenn Brasse.</p>
<p>Islam and the two other assailants set upon Mr Ainsworth in March, leaving him with cuts and bruises. When the 57-year-old clergyman returned to the congregation at St George-In-The-East church in Shadwell, east London, his face was still swollen and he had black eyes.</p>
<p>Islam, of nearby Limehouse, deserved a prison term for his crimes, Judge Brasse told him at Snaresbrook Crown Court. But he was told &lsquo;under the circumstances&rsquo; a four-month suspended sentence, paying his victim Â£1,000 and 100 hours of unpaid work would suffice.</p>
<p>In the days following the attack, the Rev Alan Green, Dean of Tower Hamlets, said there were &lsquo;faith hate&rsquo; incidents in the area every month.</p>

			<p>If they are looking for a &#8216;faith hate&rsquo; incident, I don&rsquo;t think they have to look too far, an yet, somehow they don&rsquo;t find one here. Well they found a number just not one in this incident. </p>
<p>The British are being prepared for the take over: Nothing can be taken seriously, and, &#8216;Nobody does anything except to help themselves&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>What if a group of three white men had cornerned anyone, of any race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, faith, or language group, said, &#8220;you fu**ing [insert label of the group here]&#8221; and beaten him severely?</p>
<p>How would the justice system treat them?</p>

			<p>I feel badly for the Brits. Like America, they have been sold our by their own incompetent liberal government. Like our government, theirs condones and supports immigration from third world countries in the name of &#8220;diversity&#8221;. When these people arrive in a civilized country the bring their culture and tribalistic mannerisms to the guest country rather than attempting to adapt. Then they whine about disctimination while all along breeding like rats. This in turn produced more whining vermen who suck the welfare system dry while contributing nothing to their guest country except illegitimate kids and fertilizer. People need to start remembering who sold them out when elections roll around and vote these traitors out of office before it is too late.</p>

			<p>  My heart cries out for the U.K. I cannot believe they are in worse shape than the U.S. But then, if osama obama gets elected, then we will be equally screwed. I always thought all the 60&rsquo;s hippies were imprisoned and/or freeze-dried by now. Surprise!!!  They are in government positions now. They hated this country then and they are Hell-bent on proving just how much real soon. In the U.K., they were denied their basic right to self defense by their government, and were basically told that they could not protect them. I really don&rsquo;t know if we will be able to bail them out of this mess. We probably won&rsquo;t be able to save ourselves. </p>

			<p>This is, or should be an event that rivals or eclipses the start of the Sydney/Cronulla riots.  Australians consider beating up a life guard at their stand  akin to breaking into the Temple and tearing the toga off a priestess. They reacted accordingly. Here it actually happened without the metaphor. And I`m not seeing a whole lot in response. </p>

			<p>A few thoughts,,</p>
<p>1) Another British casualty of not listening to Enoch Powell.</p>
<p>2) Typical non-White cowardice. A three on one attck.</p>
<p>3) The judge should be horse-whipped.</p>

			<p>Every generation constitutes a barbarian horde that must be civilized by their families, schools, and churches. Guess what happens when that doesn&rsquo;t occur because society/government has decided not to for whatever reason (in America it&rsquo;s because the progressives overwhelmed the institutions responsible [e.g. babyboomers]: this sort of destructive nonsense. If you won&rsquo;t civilize the barbarians, then prepare for the barbarianism. </p>

			<p>A suspended sentence? That&rsquo;s too insane to even comprehend. </p>
<p>From a comment posted to the original article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years ago a drunk told Muslims to go back to their own country - no violence just insults.. He got 6 months IN prison.</p>

Hmmm. Code no doubt for saying that you are a Muslim and therefore above the law. After all the priest was only an infidel and Sharia Law says that he is fair game.</p>
<p>Imagine if I had beaten up an Imam. Long jail sentence. loss of job and ruination for life, vilification, national news etc etc.</p>

			<p>  If this wasn&rsquo;t a so called &#8220;hate crime&#8221; than what is? I just hope the thug can be sued in civil court for damages. However, I&rsquo;m not optimistic that justice will be given to the indigenous white people of formerly Great Britain. </p>

<p>How petty.  A man is beaten half to death and all you can do is attack his religion.  Apart from that, you are wrong.  Most Christian churches do not support multiculturalism.  In fact, multiculturalism is alien to all but the most liberal churches who deny the unique mission of Christ.  Immigration is another matter.  It is true that most Churches are liberal on the issue, but what does that have to do with this poor man whom you know nothing about.  Shame on you!</p>

<p>Seems YOU miss the point that poster made. That even ONE church supports or espouses immigration (multiculturalism) is the abomination. Given the unavoidable reality MOST immigrants are little more than criminals or potential criminals in their host country.</p>

			<p>@Betty Manchester: The British have been conquered by the Romans, the Anglo-Saxons, by  William The Conquerer, By William and Mary (and yes, considering Dutch troops controlled the capital, that was a conquest)&hellip; </p>
<p>The British have convinced themselves they&rsquo;re invincible. Now they&rsquo;re paying the price. </p>
<p>I suspect their next conqueror will have an Islamic name, and he will be far crueler than any who came before him. He will try to break the British, not rule or civilize them. He will make them slaves. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still time, but only barely. When roused and filled with a righteous anger the British are truly magnificent. However, I do not expect to see that happen ever again&hellip; </p>

			<p>To save money the government has been determined not to build any more prisons; however immigration has led to the existing ones overflowing. The result is that there&rsquo;s extreme pressure on judges to avoiding imprisoning, to impose the shortest sentences possible and to release early.</p>

<p>It would have been better had this priest fought to the death against these muslim miscreants. At least he would have served the purpose of becoming a martyr. Instead, he slinks behind the doors of his church refusing to stand up for the god he serves. <br/>

<p>Same problem the US had in the 70&rsquo;s. Prisons had become a revolving door or people who should have gone to prison didn&rsquo;t and crime began to soar. People became increasing fed up and in the 80&rsquo;s, the victim&rsquo;s rights movement became huge here in the US. People started demanding an end to the revolving door and lax sentences and voted to increase funds to build more prisons. Today we have enough prisons and more prisoners than anywhere else in the developed world just about, but our crime rate has fallen to its&rsquo; lowest level in 30 years. The  only exception is inner city black gun violence, which usually occurs between gangs and such criminals and these types have no problem with prison as it&rsquo;s just a rite of passage to them. The UK may be forced to start funding more prisons, either that or have crime continue to spiral upwards.</p>

			<p>To Betty Manchester,<br/>
                     Actually the Vikings (or Danes) during the Anglo-Saxon period not only invaded and conquered half of England (and exacted a very heavy tribute from the English), they also carried off many English as slaves to the slave markets of continental Europe.</p>
