<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Between the night of May 31 and the wee hours of the morning of June 1, 2008, between 20 and 30 black teenagers formed a mob to terrorize the citizens of Mount Clemens, Michigan. These hoodlums robbed people of cell phones and wallets, threw a brick through the window of a moving car, and beat up their victims so badly that at least one of their targets was hospitalized with a fractured skull. In an article in the Macomb Daily entitled &ldquo;Mob, Carnival Attacks May Be Linked&rdquo; (6/5/2008), the mother of one of the victims told police that &ldquo;her son was on the ground trying to fend off the attackers who were &lsquo;about ready to kick his head in&rsquo; when deputies arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horror of what transpired was articulated in another article in the Macomb Daily entitled &ldquo;Mob of Young Men Attacks&rdquo; (6/2/2008). According to that article, &ldquo;[W]orkers at the gas station [where one of the beatings by the mob occurred] said the man was confronted near a pay telephone. When the gas station attendant saw what was happening, he locked the front door.&rdquo; As the man pounded on the door to beg the gas station attendant to let him in so that he could get away from the thugs, the mob arrived. The article in the Macomb Daily goes on to say that &ldquo;An employee [of the gas station] said workers had to wash the man&rsquo;s blood from the door Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The victim who suffered worst was not the one who was attacked at the gas station. According to a press release posted on the website of the Macomb County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office:</p>
<p>[W]hen a 29-year old man, and his wife, were driving on North River Road .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. more than two dozen men wearing ball caps and baggy shorts spread out across the street and blocked traffic. The victim tried to drive past them and someone threw a brick in his window. He stopped his car and got out to see what happened and was beaten unconscious and left with a fractured skull.</p>
<p>In an article in the Macomb Daily entitled &ldquo;Violence Shocks Community&rdquo; (6/3/2008), the newspaper reports that &ldquo;In a 911 cellular phone call released to the media Monday, the beaten man&rsquo;s frantic wife is heard screaming repeatedly as a dispatcher unsuccessfully tries to get information from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macomb County Sheriff Mark Hackel said in an interview with WJR radio host Frank Beckmann on June 6, 2008, that when the wife of the victim called 911, &ldquo;You could hear the sheer terror in her voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The incidents were so bad that, according to one of the articles in the Macomb Daily:</p>
<p>[S]ome law enforcers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. liken the violence by the group to &lsquo;wilding.&rsquo; The term became known to law enforcement following the April 1989 New York City rape and beating &mdash; involving as many as 50 teenagers &mdash; that left a 28-year-old female jogger near death. Those involved in &lsquo;wilding&rsquo; travel in packs, assaulting and terrorizing their victims randomly.</p>
<p>Though the police have arrested a very small fraction of the thugs who terrorized Mount Clemens, many remain on the loose. According to an article in the Detroit Free Press entitled &ldquo;Mob Beat Up Driver, Police Say,&rdquo; one of the victims who suffered a black eye requested not to be identified by name in the article, because &ldquo;most of the mob is still at-large [and he&rsquo;s] afraid they&rsquo;ll attack again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In every single article about the mob incident in which 20 to 30 black teenagers terrorized Mount Clemens, the journalists of the Macomb Daily, Detroit Free Press, and Detroit News neglected to mention the race of the perpetrators of this horrific crime spree. In every single video and picture of the perpetrators that the Macomb County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office released on their website, the thugs are unsurprisingly all black.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned interview with Sheriff Mark Hackel, Frank Beckmann asked:</p>
<p>Sheriff, all the kids in the video I saw are African-American. All of your victims are white. Is there evidence that this was somehow [attacks based on race]?</p>
<p>Hackel responded with &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question that we are asking.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.   If it&rsquo;s a hate crime and it happens to be a white person and the other people involved are African-Americans, we look at those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Beckmann inquired as to whether or not there is a &ldquo;law to charge them with some kind of hate crime,&rdquo; Hackel answered, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s questionable. I don&rsquo;t know if it applies to an unprotected class, and I don&rsquo;t know if whites are part of that. I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beckmann was shocked to hear Hackel suggest that whites are not entitled to equal protection under the law. A taken aback Beckmann asked:</p>
<p>You mentioned &lsquo;unprotected class.&rsquo; You mean white people are not protected by hate crime legislation?</p>
<p>Hackel answered that question by saying, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t appear as such at this point and time that there is something that would qualify.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Even though a horde of black thugs beat to the point of unconsciousness one innocent white man who was reported to have a fractured skull, threw a brick at a car that was driven by an innocent white woman, and beat up an innocent white man at a gas station to the point where employees had to clean up the bloody mess the following day, it is unlikely that the thugs will be charged with committing hate crimes, because the criminals were black and the victims were white. Because of this simple fact, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton did not seemingly arrive in Mount Clemens the very next day after the altercation to protest &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; and there is no &ldquo;Million Man March&rdquo; scheduled to protest the black-on-white crimes that occurred. If a mob of whites were to do to innocent black victims what the black mob did to innocent white victims, the American people would not hear the end of it. What happened in Jena, Louisiana, would seem insignificant, and not because Jena was insignificant, but through comparison, people would view Jena as being child&rsquo;s play compared to the modern-day lynch mob that terrorized the small town in southeastern Michigan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is important to note that though Hackel suggested that state and federal law does not protect white folk like it does for &ldquo;protected classes,&rdquo; he still has vowed to hunt down and bring to justice the thugs who targeted innocent whites who did not provoke the crimes meted out to them. In interviews with the media, Hackel has described the attacks as &ldquo;savage,&rdquo; and has said that &ldquo;Not even animals act like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Macomb County Sheriff Office is working diligently to hunt down the people who took part in the horde of black thugs. Within less than a week of the attacks by the mob, charges have already been filed against 16-year-old Jemall Davidson, 17-year-old Johnny Allor, and 18-year-old Steven Lincoln. The first two face life in prison on charges of assault with intent to murder and a 10-year felony charge of engaging in a riot, and the last one faces 10 years in prison for engaging in a riot and assault.</p>
