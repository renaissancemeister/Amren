						<p>Irish voters have rejected the European Union&rsquo;s Lisbon treaty, putting plans to overhaul the bloc&rsquo;s institutions in peril and humiliating Ireland&rsquo;s political leaders.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Dermot Ahern conceded the vote shortly after midday on Friday as tallies from around the country showed the treaty had been defeated in an overwhelming number of constituencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like this will be a &lsquo;No&rsquo; vote,&rdquo; Mr. Ahern told RTE television. &ldquo;At the end of the day for a myriad of reasons the people have spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lisbon treaty was itself an effort to resurrect EU reforms that were torpedoed by French and Dutch voters in 2005.</p>
<p>This time Ireland was only country to entrust its voters with a referendum. The &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote means a country with fewer than 1 percent of the EU&rsquo;s 490 million population could doom a treaty painstakingly negotiated by all 27 member states.</p>
<p>The Lisbon treaty envisages a long-term president of the European Council of EU leaders, a stronger foreign policy chief and a mutual defence pact. Fourteen countries have already ratified the treaty in their national parliaments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the first time Irish voters have shocked the EU. They almost wrecked the bloc&rsquo;s plans for eastward expansion in 2001 by rejecting the Nice treaty, but the government staged a second referendum in which that pact passed. The government has said it is not considering a re-run this time around.<br>

			<p><i>&#8220;This time, Ireland was only country to entrust its voters with a referendum. The &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote means a country with fewer than 1 percent of the EU&rsquo;s 490 million population could doom a treaty painstakingly negotiated by all 27 member states.  It wasn&rsquo;t the first time Irish voters have shocked the EU. They almost wrecked the bloc&rsquo;s plans for eastward expansion in 2001 by rejecting the Nice treaty, <b>but the government staged a second referendum in which that pact passed. &#8220;</b></i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
We&rsquo;ll see how the politicians manage to get around this one. We can&rsquo;t expect the brazen politicos, in their contempt for the public will, to back down and accept that they&rsquo;ve had their wrists slapped.  Just look at their repeated attempts in America to sneak an amnesty bill through, despite all the massive public resistance.  There is no limit to their determination and their shame!</p>
<p>One of the first items on the agenda, I suspect, will be the abolition of all referenda. It seems that &#8220;the people&#8221;, when allowed to have their say, don&rsquo;t vote the way they&rsquo;re supposed to!   Well, well. Something will have to be done about that.</p>
<p>No wonder they&rsquo;re determined to import a new electorate as quickly as possible.</p>

			<p>This is not only great news for Irish nationalists, but nationalists in other EU countries that have ratified the Treaty.  The EU treaty won&rsquo;t take effect in any country unless so many have ratified it.  So Irish rejection saves France, Germany, etc.</p>

			<p>The Irish should reject the EU itself and return to the pristine homogenous nation of yesteryear.  Not all change is good.  In fact, very little change is the best change of all.</p>

<p>I beg to differ with the Globe&rsquo;s characterization.  I would probably rewrite the statement as follows:</p>
<p>The &#8220;No&#8221; vote means that the only the people who were allowed to vote on this far reaching agreement,in an open and fair public referendum,were the people of a country with fewer than 1 percent of the EU&rsquo;s 490 population.  </p>
<p>&#8220;a treaty painstakingly negotiated by all 27 member states&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously not painstakingly enough since the Treaty failed in a democratic referendum.  Perhaps the authors should go back to the negotiating table and create an agreement that is acceptable to the most important constituency of all: the people of the European Union.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Irish strike a blow for freedom in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, but they&rsquo;re importing blacks and other third world rabble just like the rest of the West, and it is resulting in a horrifying predicament in progress in Ireland.</p>
<p>When they wake up to having been &#8220;taken&#8221; by the multicults, here are a people who will fight back and fight back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>The UK may well have its hands full once again, but this time by whites instead of rioting blacks and Muslims.</p>

			<p>Michael C. Scott hit the nail on the head; the other nations didn&rsquo;t allow a vote on this treaty, or the previous ones, because they knew their elitist agenda would go down in flames.</p>
<p>Remember that the next time you hear politicians blather about their love of &#8220;democracy.&#8221;</p>

Well, if it had only 200 members, then it did NOT represent the will of the people either, did it?</p>
<p>In fact, it was even LESS representative, or concerned with public opinion, than the present politicans of the EU.</p>
<p>And while it may have fought to get the British thrown OUT, it is very happy to welcome IN third world immigrants to add to its merry marxist mix.  </p>

<p>The U.S. administration wants to enlarge its missile defence system to Central and Eastern Europe by building a radar in the Czech Republic and a missile base in Poland that will allegedly protect Western countries from missile attacks by &#8216;rogue&rsquo; states in the Middle East. </p>
<p>&#8220;We turned to hunger strikes because this is a problem of democracy. For two years we have made protests and petitions to the government but they keep negotiating with the U.S., ignoring that two-thirds of the Czech public are against this &#8216;star wars&rsquo; system,&#8221; Tamas told IPS. </p>
<p>The pro-radar media has frequently labelled outspoken opponents of the radar as anti-American, communists, pro-Russians or even sympathisers of Muslim organisations.</p>

			<p>Ah&hellip;  The luck of the Irish.  Way to go, Ireland!</p>
<p>This &#8220;treaty&#8221; was defeated by France and Holland in 2005, so the EU &#8220;leaders&#8221; decided to give it a different name with prettier wrapping.  Sound familiar?  Here in North America, the corporate leaders are sensing a growing opposition to a &#8220;North American Union,&#8221; so they&rsquo;re going to try and rename this monstrosity and wrap it in prettier paper.  </p>
<p>I can only hope that we in America will follow the common sense lead of the Irish!</p>
<p>To heck with giving up our sovereignty and quality of life for the profit of corporations!  We need to listen to the Irish.  They make good sense!</p>

			<p>This is why the elites on the Far Left hate democracy. Like Hitler, Stalin, Mao and the rest,&rsquo;the people&rsquo; have one purpose,to be manipulated as useful idiots to propel them to power. As a result of this referendum the EU advocates will start to search for a way out of this messy voting business. I forsee a time in the not too distant future when Democracy will start to take a few knocks eventually to become, as it was for the Nazis, an inferior system of government that is subject to the will of ignorant and unthinking masses. I have already heard Far Left assocatiates express the opinion that democracy is not the only system of government that works. <br>

			<p>I read the treaty, and it appears the Irish government had absolutely no choice but to put it to a public vote, as all changes to the Irish Constitution require a national referendum.</p>
<p>There was a parliamentary vote in favor of the treaty in the Oireachtas, with Sinn Fein opposed to it.</p>
<p>Both Poland and Britain held out for special provisions in the treaty allowing their own courts independance from the European Court.</p>

			<p>   Thank God for the Irish. Just another reason I have for being proud of my Irish heritage. The Irish will fight (literally). They are still close descendents of the Vikings! And that is what it will take to save Europe. Reawakening of the Viking blood in the people of Europe. Win or lose, at least give &#8216;em Hell to pay! I still hold onto hope for Europe. They are beginning to see the treachery and deceit that their leaders have lead them into. There will be Hell to pay once the blinders are removed. I may live in the states, but I would gladly go to western Europe and help them fight the good fight. I may be American by birth, but my heart is still with my people in the U.K. and Ireland. Just ask me for help, I will come to western Europe and stand shoulder to shoulder with my people and fight to the death if need be for my ancestors and European brothers and sisters. I am not a crazed zealot or anything, I&rsquo;m just fed-up to the brim watching the people of Europe being over-run by the hoardes of non-assimilating invaders. Yes, we have our problems here in the states with illegals also. But, I fear the problems in western Europe are even worse. I don&rsquo;t want to see the countries of my people destroyed by third-world parasites. I am extremely proud of my white heritage and I will fight for it. One thing most people don&rsquo;t realize, all that is happening is by design by a certain group of people. We, as individuals, must realize whom these people are. They are our worst enemies. Once we re-take our homelands, these people must also be expelled from our countries. You and I have a good idea who they are.</p>

			<p>don&rsquo;t worry the this is the same EU constitution that was killed off - last time they made the mistake of putting it vote in other countries&hellip;they won&rsquo;t make the same mistake next time- next time they are hoping :<br>
a. ireland will have enough immigrants and pc types to tip the scale<br>
b. they will bribe or coerce a politician who &#8216;promised&rsquo; to put it to vote (like Gordon Brown did in the UK)<br>
c. they will find away around the irish law about voting on treaties - </p>
<p>first they called it a constitution - that failed, so they renamed the same laws a &#8216;treaty&rsquo; - as we speak you can be sure some bureucrat is finding a way to use the existing EU structure and agreements so it countries won&rsquo;t even have a choice&hellip;</p>
<p>I am certain at this point if a country were to try to leave the EU they would be subject to the same reaction as the south did when they (legally) left the union</p>

<p>Why not?  Look at the situations on rebellion throughout history.  It&rsquo;s always the courageous few who are actually in the trenches doing the real fighting for everybody.  Only 10% of American patriots were initially involved in the American Revolution.  In the coming conflagration, it will be the same. </p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, it was even LESS representative, or concerned with public opinion, than the present politicans of the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>By &#8220;it&#8221; I&rsquo;m assuming you mean the IRA.  How do you know what they are/were concerned about?  The fact is you don&rsquo;t.  Not even close.</p>
<p>&#8220;And while it may have fought to get the British thrown OUT, it is very happy to welcome IN third world immigrants to add to its merry marxist mix.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know of no IRA advocates who are happy to welcome in third world immigrants.  How do you arrive at that conclusion? </p>
<p>&#8220;Some patriots the IRA were! Wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wolves in sheeps clothing?&#8221;  You haven&rsquo;t proven anything other than you don&rsquo;t know anything about the situation and your thoughts on the matter are naive and immature.  </p>

Indeed.   Why would anyone voluntarily give up self-rule for foreign rule? - - - <br>
(unless for the lure of EU investment, jobs, and short-term economic benefits).</p>
<p>Therefore, since the other countries of the EU have actually done so, and if my reasoning is correct, does that not imply that they are NOT truly &#8220;free people&#8221;?</p>

			<p>&#8221;It&rsquo;s not easy trying to figure out what the treaty is about, but it appears to increase the power of the central (EU) government (what else?)&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was deliberately written that way to confuse. Even the Irish leader Cowen admitted he hadn&rsquo;t read the Lisbon Treaty fully thus unwittingly giving a huge boost to the &#8216;No&rsquo; campaign. The surprise result from the normally pro-EU Irish was a kick in the teeth to the closet-marxist politicians who control the EU &amp; their plan for a EU[SSR] superstate where nation-states become mere regions. </p>
<p>Of course the Lisbon Treaty is a rehash [98% the same] under a different name of the Constitutional Treaty rejected by French &amp; Netherlands voters in referendums in 2005. Only Ireland gave it&rsquo;s voters a chance to vote this time in a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty because the Irish Constitution says it must do for any changes to the Constitution. Despite the fact that all 27 EU nations must approve this constitutional change, the result heralded a closing of ranks by the elitist governments who muppet-like chimed in unison &#8216;the ratification process continues&rsquo;. </p>
<p>But in the last two days some oppostion politicians here in the UK &amp; elsewhere have voiced their disapproval of this flagrant denial of ordinary people&rsquo;s rights &amp; have spoken out. Then late last night came a breakthrough &amp; the snowball set in motion by the Irish &#8216;No&rsquo; vote continued to gain momentum when Czech President Vaclav Klaus broke ranks &amp; declared that the ordinary people had spoken &amp; their wishes not the wishes of elitist EU bureaucrats must be respected.</p>
<p>Of course the neo-Marxist elitists don&rsquo;t recognise democracy &amp; will attempt to railroad through the Lisbon Treaty by stealth &amp; bribery but their plans have been exposed to the light &amp; it will now be much more difficult for them to do so.</p>
<p>It is no surprise to me that the EU[SSR] superstate may have  been thwarted by first, Ireland, a very small nation who has long had to struggle for its independence a freedom. The UK blog sites are full of praise for the Irish &amp; I&rsquo;m sure many pints of the brown nectar are being lifted by nationalists everywhere to toast this great common-sense decision by the Irish people. </p>
<p>And Second, by the Czechs, another small nation &amp; former USSR satellite who have long had to struggle for their freedom. The East European nations have had to live under the dead hand of the Marxist state &amp; we can learn much from their ordinary people &amp; the courageous Czech President, Vaclav Klaus. </p>
<p>Make no mistake, this rejection of further powers for the construction of the EU[SSR] superstate could be pivotal in the politics of Europe &amp; thus the whole Western world. It is time now for all anti-EUSSR people throughout Europe to rally round &amp; thwart the plans of the elite politicians.</p>

			<p>&#8221; Reawakening of the Viking blood in the people of Europe&#8221;</p>
<p>It will take a lot to reawaken that. </p>
<p>I attended a dinner party in Norway a few years ago where many of the attendees were having someone else drive them because they intended to have one glass of wine. The DUI limit there is .02  &mdash;  it is .08 in the US, which is lower than the old .10. In the US, anything lower than 0.02 is considered to be no alcohol. And the fines in Norway are based on the driver&rsquo;s income.</p>
<p>So the descendants of those whose ancestors once raped and pillaged the western world have come to this!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect much from them.</p>

			<p>&#8221;This went beyond left or right, this is about a political elite who are so pc elitist that when you challenge there viewpoint youre an extremist even if your being totally logical on certain issues&hellip;&#8221;-Infidel</p>
<p>I agree that the opposition to an EU superstate may contain both left &amp; right but the pc elitists are most definitely of the Left.<br>
 <br>
Angela Merkel is an &#8216;ex-Marxist&rsquo; &amp; former official in the old GDR. </p>
<p>David Miliband, UK Foreign Secretary is a third-generation Marxist. </p>
<p>Hillary Benn, Environmental Secretary &amp; son of dyed-in-the-wool former Marxist/Labour MP Tony Benn. </p>
<p>Former Home Secretary Jack [Britain is not worth saving] Straw is another cabinet member who is an &#8216;ex-Marxist&rsquo; </p>
<p>The majority of the UK New Labour cabinet are either &#8216;ex-Marxists&rsquo; or Fabian Socialists [Marxism in slow motion]. The above is only a short list from off the top of my head [I intend to do more research] &amp; the real numbers of Marxists &amp; their fellow-travellers are much much higher. Strange isn&rsquo;t it, that these high-ranking politicians were all Marxist radicals as students yet managed to climb to the top of the political greasy pole. It&rsquo;s as if they were aided by some unseen hand. Certainly being a Marxist is no hindrance to political success in the UK &amp; the EU.</p>
<p>In other EU countries we have the same type of situation &amp; the whole EU confidence trick can become confusing unless we remember that Marxism is an internationalist ideology. </p>
<p>Plan A was the old Soviet-style economic Marxism which was supposed to unite the world under Communism until it collapsed in ignominy. This latest Plan B is the construction of a EU superstate where eventually nation-states become mere regions &amp; the EU is enlarged to include Turkey, North Africa &amp; others. Same thing, different method.</p>
<p>The EU superstate has come a long way from what started out as just a free trade market [Common Market] hatched by these same type of people in the 60&rsquo;s. USA/Canada beware.</p>

			<p>Well, I think the EU has a lot of good things going for it, most importantly a foreign minister. I even voted &#8220;yes&#8221; for the last treaty, but I was angry that we were refused the vote for the second time, and I approve of this, pro-EU or not. If the treaty is broke, FIX IT.</p>

There is a possibility for you to get Irish citizenship.  It all depends on your wife&rsquo;s ancestry.  If she has a parent or grandparent born in Ireland and has the documentation to prove it, she can obtain Irish citizenship.  Once she had done so, it should not be too difficult for her to pass that on to you.  I do not know the particulars of Irish law regarding spouses.  I do know it regarding citizenship by decent and the law regulating passing that citizenship to children.  If you have obtained your Irish citizenship by decent prior to your having children, then they are entitled to Irish citizenship.  I say this because I did it  &mdash;  my father was of sicilian decent and mother of Irish decent(and swiss/german).  My maternal grandfather who immigrated to the US around WWI was born and raised in Ireland.  Before I got married, I applied for and was entered into the Irish foreign births registrar(=obtained Irish citizenship) which I recently passed on to my children.  Ireland has since tightened its citizenship law up a bit but I do not think that it will affect this.  The decisive thing is that your wife must have a parent or grandparent born in Ireland and have the documentation to prove it.  If you have a business, you might well be able to obtain Irish citizenship by investment(most countries have provisions for those with enough capital to establish businesses)but I don&rsquo;t know how much money you would be required to invest.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the EU process, a similar constitution with a different name was proposed several years ago and submitted to referendum in France and Denmark.  Both countries rejected the new constitution.  The EUcrats then went back to the drawing boards and came up with a very similar, undemocratic, constitution but having learned from their previous mistake, did not call it a constitution and did not submit it to member state referenda.  They instead called it a &#8220;treaty&#8221;, the treaty of Lisbon, and submitted it to the member state legislatures who all passed it.  The only reason that Ireland was forced to have a referendum was that it is in the Irish constitution  &mdash;  -that all major changes in the government be submitted to referendum.  What the so-called Treaty of Lisbon would do, though it is hard to understand it as it is a long and obscure document with multiple appendices, is to establish a governing hierarchy for the entire EU.  At the top would be a council of ministers of EU countries.  Directly below them would be another level of unelected EU functionaries who would make all of the laws.  At the very bottom of the hierarchy would be the EU parliament which, while containing elected members, could not propose legislation and could only make non-binding suggestions about legislation.  So the entire thing stinks to high heaven and eliminates any element of democracy from the EU government.<br>
Thank God for the Irish constitution and people.  The treaty, as has been mentioned, requires that all EU countries endorse it and that is no longer possible according to the rules. Thus, Ireland&rsquo;s vote has protected the national sovereignty of the rest of Europe.  The current EU president has, nevertheless, urged the remaining EU countries who have not yet approved it to continue the process.  Obviously, he does not think the Irish NO vote is decisive and no doubt has a number of strategies to overcome it.  Will they require the Irish to keep on voting until they get the desired result or will they somehow go around the Irish vote in some other way?  Remember that this, the EU government, is one which is happy to continually change the rules until it gets what it wants.  Keep your eyes open for that is what is developing. </p>

			<p>Since Sinn Fein opposed it, I see no hope at all that this plot to reenslave Europe will ever work.  This was the old political branch of the Provisional Irish Republican Army.  Though the SAS resorted to torture and murder, and though the Provisionals never had more than 200 active members, they were never defeated.</p>
<p>My mother has my copy of &#8220;When Ireland Saved Civilization&#8221;, so I don&rsquo;t have the ISBN number handy, but I read it ten years ago, and liked it very much.  I&rsquo;ll have to reread it.</p>
<p>I told you all that the EU councils are unelected bodies of career bureaucrats.  </p>
<p>I could like an EU only if there was one representative per 10,000 inhabitants, who had to address them in person in a public building near them every weekend, and whom even one of these representatives got an absolute and total veto over proposed laws and treaties.  I&rsquo;d like that in the US, too.  It would result in the breakup of large, overly-centralized countries.</p>
<p>Laws for the public good would easily pass.  Laws for the sake of more laws never would.</p>

			<p>Ireland was the only country to entrust it&rsquo;s people with a referendum??? My God!!! What does that have to say about European countries in general and the EU in particular? So much for freedom of speech. So much for the will of the people. What has happened to the Europe that I loved and cherished? What has happened the the minds of it&rsquo;s people? How dare any government think that it has the right to withhold or bestow referendums when the fate of the entire nation is at stake? Either the people hold the reins of government or the government reigns over the people. God help us all. When I was younger, not in my wildest dreams could I have envisioned what has happened to Europe and the rest of the white world. My vision was of a white world that kept getting better and better in science, medicine, the arts, a world where we were literally reaching for the stars with interplanetary exploration and a greater understanding of the mysteries of the universe. Instead we were inundated with non-white third worlders, our cities turned into crime ridden pestholes, our education systems dumbed down to accomodate the new comers and turned marxist with no free thought or free speech. Say something about a non-white and you&rsquo;ll end up in jail or with a hefty fine. Everyone is protected as long as you&rsquo;re not white european with an actual stake in the future of your nation. Our children are indoctrinated to despise our fathers and forefathers as despoilers of other races and nations. Where will their allegiance lie when they grow up, I wonder? With their own race or with those who ravage and rape our women and steal from our treasuries to fund their anti-white agenda with the full aid and acceptance of those who would rule over us. Our fathers and forefathers were great men, loyal to their countries, founders of great nations, builders of empires, and never was their like in all the history of the world. What have we become? What will we allow ourselves to become?? If we continue as we are, we will surely be destroyed and all that has been handed down to us in the past 5000 years will become meaningless. </p>

			<p>Ireland has suffered the highest immigration rate in the world. <br>
Mostly from black Africa via France. I sat on a bus going through Kildare with several black women screaming at each over lottery tickets  across the front seats. The Irish sat there politely but with a look on their faces as if a load of manure had just been dropped off in their front room.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
The red hair is not Scandinavian. It&rsquo;s distinctively Celtic, perhaps pre-Celtic. And not a great percentage of Irish are blond.  In Scandinava today, while blonds are everywhere, red hair is somewhat rare;   and what  red there is was probably brought in by slaves imported from the British Isles. After all, that&rsquo;s what the Vikings went there for:  in search of slaves and booty, not to be nice to the natives. They were the terror of Northern Europe, and the British Isles (all of them)  probably got the worst of it.</p>
<p>I remember meeting a Swedish student from Stockholm who was studying in Ireland.  He was fascinated at the number of redheads and commented on them (and also on their rarity in Sweden).<br>

<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Irish and Icelanders are both Celt/Viking hybrids. The difference is that in Iceland, the Viking language and culture dominated (since the Celt infusion was mostly women), whereas in Ireland, the Celtic language and culture ended up dominating due to Brian Boru and the Battle of Clontarf. But there&rsquo;s really little difference.</p>

<p><i>This time Ireland was only country to entrust its voters with a referendum. The &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote means a country with fewer than 1 percent of the EU&rsquo;s 490 million population could doom a treaty painstakingly negotiated by all 27 member states.</i></p>

			<p>&#8220;Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world  &mdash;  he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.&#8221; -Revelations 12: 7-9.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, &#8220;Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?&#8221; And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months; it opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven. Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation, and all who dwell on earth will worship it, every one whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain.&#8221; -Revelations 13</p>

<p>If you believe Leif made good points, I have to tell you that you&rsquo;re not reading my posts with much comprehension.
