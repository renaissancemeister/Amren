				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The American Civil War Center is weighing a $100,000 gift to its interactive Richmond education center.</p>
<p>The gift is a bronze likeness of Confederate President Jefferson Davis being cast by Lexington sculptor Gary Casteel. The offer comes from the Sons of Confederate Veterans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Center officials and representatives of the Sons of Confederate Veterans will discuss the offer on Tuesday. No immediate decision is expected.<br>

			<p>This is the statue not only of Davis but his son Joseph (who died during the war years) and Jim Limber a black child. Jim Limber was taken in by the Davis&rsquo;s after they saw the child being beaten by a black adult. With no legal guardian he stayed at the White House of the Confederacy in Richmond until the war forced them to flee. Limber was caught along with Davis in Georgia, Limber was taken North and never heard from again, Jeff Davis tried to locate the boy after the war with no success.<br>
Sadly the statue is just an attempt by the Sons of Confederate Veterans to to show the CSA as something it was not. The CSA was clearly a White mans government but todays decedents won&rsquo;t defend it as such. They try to cloud the issue with myths of black and Confederates and stories like this, a sad display. They feel Davis can only be excepted if he is shown to be something he was not a man in favor of racial mixing.</p>

			<p>Only life size?  The statue should stand astride a city street, like the Colossus of Rhodes.</p>

			<p>Of course the NAACP&rsquo;s King Salim Khalfani is opposed.  The Civil War Center already has a statue of U.S. President Lincoln on display.  What would be the relevence of representing the Confederate President?   Besides, how many statues of white guys do they need, anyhow?</p>

			<p>When Mexican government &#8220;donates&#8221; to American public schools propaganda texts that distort the history of American-Mexican relations then it must be unconditionally accepted because a gift is a gift and it would be stupid (and rude) to not accept it.</p>
<p>But if the Sons of Confederate Veterans offer a gift that the above principles do not apply.</p>
<p>One of the most fundamental flaws of &#8220;liberalism&#8221; is that it is based on double standard and mutually contradictory doctrines. All &#8220;liberal&#8221; absurdity follows from this fact. The best one can do to make the American citzen aware of deadly dangers of &#8220;liberalism&#8221; is to expose its duplicity in public. Most of regular people will no support anything based on lie, and half of &#8220;liberal&#8221; promisses belong to that category.<br>

			<p>Those &#8216;dirty rotten racists!&rsquo; Imagine their gall, wanting to erect a statue honoring a White American who risked his life and future for a cause (the right of dissident states to secede from a Union which no longer worked on their behalf.) Why can&rsquo;t they erect a bigger statute   &mdash;   of the Grand Extortioner, Jesse Jackson (that name reminds me of something else)? Or that other equally worthless race-baiting fraud, Al Sharpton.</p>

			<p>   I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful idea. Regardless of which side of the argument you stand by, it would be wrong not to honor this great man. He was the first and only president of the southern states. This war was fought for states rights, not slavery. If you do a little research, you will find that the emancipation proclamation was meant only for southern slaves. There were slaves for several years after the war in the north. Truly, the victor does right the history. There are alot of ways that we honor northern leaders. It is time overdue that we honor President Jefferson Davis.</p>

<p>Well, the Mexican consulate in Chicago contributed several bronze statues to Benito Juarez Academy in Chicago, so why would anyone reject an American statue?</p>

<p>This is not altogether true. Though no one even hinted that the Confederacy would not be ruled by Whites there WAS interracial mixing on many levels going on, especially in Louisiana. The state had the largest population of &#8216;Creoles&rsquo; and Free Men of Color than any other state. The two largest slave owners in Louisiana were Creoles. There was also many levels of social and commercial interchange between all of the races. The sight of Creoles, blacks, Free Men, Spaniards, and Indians was very common as were people of mixed races. Louisiana at that time was a truly free society which allowed its citizens to do what they wished without prosecution. Those that chose to mix did so. Typical of this freedom was the long history of Creole prominance in Louisiana.  Creoles were not assigned the same status as black slaves or even free blacks, but as a distinct culture. There were Creole Confederate regiments fighting alonside native Louisiana Indian Confederates.  Davis&rsquo; treatment of this black child was commonplace, not the exception. Even though slaves were deemed property there are many cases where outward affection by their owners was readily discernable. However, none of this purports to diminish the fact that the Confederacy WAS the provence of Whites and that Whites - who would share their world in some respects with non-<br>
Whites - would, without question, be the masters of it.<br>

<p>But Ron, there&rsquo;s nothing deceitful about representing the Confederates as having compassion for blacks.  That&rsquo;s just one example of what history has forgotten, and what the SCV is entrusted with correcting.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s &#8220;democratic&#8221; environment makes it difficult to defend the Confederates exactly because of their paradoxical reconcilliation of &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; and moral obligation.</p>
<p>One needs to look no further than modern &#8220;democratic&#8221; America&rsquo;s racial entitlements (from welfare to &#8220;civil rights&#8221; legislation) to see that the dilemma hasn&rsquo;t gotten swept very far under the carpet, regardless of the all the egalitarianism being crammed down our throats.</p>
<p>When we finally choke, reject, and regurgitate this toxic indoctrination, the SCV may be able to come back out of the closet and admit that, once upon a time, white southerners were convinced enough of their suitability for autonomy that they were willing to suffer, fight, and die for it.</p>
<p>Until then, the SCV seems to have its hands full just fending off criticism while doing what it can for the Confederate legacy.</p>
<p>Deo Vindice, Ron.  Keep the faith! </p>
