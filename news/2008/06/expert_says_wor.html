						<p>Diseases caused by worms and parasites are draining the health and energy of the poorest Americans, an expert said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>And diseases associated with the developing world, such as dengue fever and Chagas disease, may become a bigger problem for the United States as the climate changes, said Dr. Peter Hotez of George Washington University and the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout the American South during the early twentieth century, malaria combined with hookworm infection and pellagra (a vitamin deficiency) to produce a generation of anemic, weak, and unproductive children and adults,&#8221; Hotez wrote.</p>
<p>The parasitic diseases are having similar effects now, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;These diseases occur predominantly in people of color living in the Mississippi Delta and elsewhere in the American South, in disadvantaged urban areas, and in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, as well as in certain immigrant populations and disadvantaged white populations living in Appalachia,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DOG DROPPINGS</p>
<p>Toxocariasis, a roundworm parasite transmitted in dog droppings, infected up 2.8 million poor black children living in inner cities, the South and Appalachia, Hotez said. {snip}</p>
<p>Strongyloidiasis is caused by a threadworm that lives throughout the body and infects 68,000 to 100,000 people. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One threat to babies is cytomegalovirus, which infects 27,002 newborn annually, causing deafness and mental retardation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s amazing what we tolerate,&#8221; Hotez said. He noted the United States spends $1 billion a year preparing for outbreaks of diseases that have not occurred, including smallpox, anthrax and avian influenza.</p>
<p>&#8220;But these (other) diseases are occurring among voiceless people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s an unintended form of racism in a sense. We need to make these disease household words.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, infects as many as 8 to 11 million people in Latin America and may become a U.S. threat, Hotez said. {snip}</p>

			<p>This has little to do with native born Americans. These parasites are coming from south of the border. In the past poor Americans lived in conditions worse than today. This is a farce to blame poverty for an alien problem</p>

<p>If any proof were wanting that every last aspect of life in America has been thoroughly corrupted by leftist politics and that the word &#8220;racism&#8221; is nothing more than a meaningless noise employed in that politicization, here it is.</p>

			<p>There are large numbers of poor people in the USA. Consider that poverty in the United States is cyclical in nature with roughly 12% to 15% living below the federal poverty line at any given point in time, and roughly 40% falling below the poverty line at some time within a 10 year time span. That doesn&rsquo;t count the 20,000,000 illegals roaming the country. </p>
<p>Seems instead of letting them all fester in their squalid poverty running afoul of the justice system that it would be better to end illegal immigration and put them to work. <br>

<p>I read about these &#8216;code words&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;m wondering if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on here. What are they really talking about? Diseases, worms, parasites; draining America&rsquo;s health? Are these words being used here to represent something else?</p>

<p>&ldquo;But these (other) diseases are occurring among voiceless people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an unintended form of racism in a sense. We need to make these disease household words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No Mr. Hotez, racism isn&rsquo;t to blame. The real blame lies on the filthy, slovenly living conditions of the people who carry these parasites. </p>
<p>If Mr. Hotez wants to spend public money ridding this country of parasites, let&rsquo;s start by sending all the Mexican and South American immigrants back to their native countries. They are the worst kind of parasites that are infecting this country.</p>

<p>He may be a smart doctor, but like most people, he&rsquo;s a racial moron.</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples in Latin America and their leftist champions here also like to call the despoiling of indigenous lands by mineral companies &#8220;racism,&#8221; even though mountaintop removal for coal wreaks the same havoc on whites in Appalachia.</p>
<p>No proclamation or exhortation is complete now without the word &#8220;racism.&#8221;<br>

			<p>These damned 3rd world foreigners brought all of this disease here, and the media covers it up like it&rsquo;s normal.  When bed bugs showed up in hotels in the 90s, the media said that bed bugs had become immune to our efforts to destroy them.  All of these diseases come from 3rd world living conditions and always have. Victorian Americans weren&rsquo;t exposed to these kind of illnesses when only Europeans were migrating here because even they were subject to strict medical examinations. The Lazarettos existed for a reason!  Today, these africans, hispanics and asians who enter the US willy nilly are the culprits.  Check out the rates of how parasitic diseases occur historically in the 3rd world on any medical site on the web. </p>

			<p>Note that these things have not been a problem, not even in the south where I live, until this huge influx of 3rd worlders. And by 3rd worlders I don&rsquo;t even mean the Mexicans I mean people from Sub Sahara Africa, India, Bangladesh and such. Apparently all of the money spent by various churches in the Africas and South and Central Americas should have been spent on medical facilities instead of spreading the word of GOD because NOW those poor people are up here SPREADING their stuff in the U.S. and it is NOT the word of god.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Experts in the United States estimate that about 20% of dogs pass Toxocara eggs into their stool. In Great Britain, 24% of soil samples taken from public parks contained the eggs. &#8220;</p>
<p>This should be addressed.  </p>

			<p>I vote for FREE TRANSPORTATION back to ancestal Africa for &#8220;people of color&#8221; living in the Mississippi Delta and elsewhere in the American South (North, East and West). Said one-way transportation paid for by American taxpayers.</p>
<p>I mean I sure would not want to be accused of deliberate or overt racism because these parasites are infected by parasites. I could not agree more with the poster who suggested the term &#8220;racism&#8221; has become nothing but meaningless noise bleated by politicians and media hacks alike.</p>

			<p>At leat 15 years ago, I went for a TB test in Northern California because the Ford Foundation had subsidized tens of thousands of third world Latinos to enter my immediate surroundings, and I had developed a terrible cough that wouldn&rsquo;t quit.  I didn&rsquo;t have TB, but was told by the nurse that the real problem here was intestinal parasites (this is a once very homogeeous, high-end population), and that I wouldn&rsquo;t believe what they see.  The biggest problems is FOOD SERVICE, FOOD PREP, and now of course, imported food or food/meat handled by foreign workers in the fields and beyond.  The best possible reason to know your food sources, and grow your own!  And not patronize restaurants that obviously use foreign workers. I am encouraging everyone to grow vegetables and fruits, and trade with friends.</p>

			<p>I read some info a while back that blacks have more of a chance for picking up various parasites, due to their many years in Africa where the population passed along the parasitic infestation from one person to another throughout history, due to unsanitary living conditions and black lack of immunity to infection, which besets them, for the most part, today, throughout black communities across the country.</p>
<p>I think screening should be set up, not only in the schools, but the jails, prisons, and work sites, requiring all blacks to be screened so they can&rsquo;t pass anything along to white people, because blacks, in general, have unsanitary living habits and are probably infected.</p>

			<p>In a &#8220;healthy/unhealthy&#8221; food article on today&rsquo;s MSN, a point was raised respective to vegetables&hellip; that many food workers do NOT practice good hygiene. Now consider that MOST food workers happen to be Mexicans (also known as illegal immigrants). Draw your own conclusion about that restaurant you were planning to eat at this weekend.</p>

			<p> It reminds me of the blacks who perennially fall for various scams at tax time, such as paying phony preparers hundreds of dollars to claim &#8220;slavery reparation credits&#8221; on their 1040s. They&rsquo;re always so surprised when the IRS lands on them like the proverbial ton of bricks. I call that &#8220;looters getting looted,&#8221; and it always gives me a big laugh. There&rsquo;s no better form of justice than the poetic kind.</p>

<p>Good advice!  I&rsquo;ve started growing my own vegetables &amp; herbs.  People ask why, and I tell them 1) skyrocketing prices and 2) a vulnerable food supply.  They look at me like I&rsquo;m paranoid and in my mind I just think, &#8220;Yeah, enjoy the worms&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>I had a hookworm infection for a long time apparently. You take a few pills, you see some wiggly white worms a while later, and then you feel WAY less tired. I don&rsquo;t have the faintest idea how I got it, but I&rsquo;m about as finicky and sanitary of a guy around. I guess anyone can get it. I wish I would have saved the damn worms now because afterwards docs kept telling me that I never had it. But I&rsquo;ve never seen white wiggly worms in the bowl before, esp after taking an antiparasitical.</p>
