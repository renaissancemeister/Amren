						<p>Surrounded by royal guards and the occasional tourist, Her Majesty Mahealani Kahau and her government ministers hold court every day in a tent outside the palace of Hawaii&rsquo;s last monarch, passing laws and discussing how to secure reparations for the Native Hawaiian people.</p>
<p>Kahau and her followers are members of the self-proclaimed Hawaiian Kingdom Government, which is devoted to restoring the Hawaiian monarchy overthrown in 1893. Nearly two months ago, they stormed the gates of the old Iolani Palace, and they have politely occupied the grounds ever since, operating like a government-in-exile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re here to assume and resume what is already ours and what has always been ours,&#8221; said Kahau, who is a descendant of Hawaii&rsquo;s last king and was elected &#8220;head of state&#8221; by the group.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian Kingdom Government, which was founded seven years ago and claims 1,000 followers, uses its own license plates and maintains its own judicial system. In recent years, members have voted to dissolve the state of Hawaii, its land titles, welfare programs and public schools. They also claim the right to confiscate all bank assets in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The organization&rsquo;s actions do not carry the force of law, and the state has mostly taken a hands-off approach. It has not confiscated any of the license plates, for example, or arrested anyone for using them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On April 30, members of the Hawaiian Kingdom Government trooped onto the palace grounds in the heart of Honolulu and shut the gates behind them, leading to a few tense hours before they finally reopened the entrance.</p>
<p>Every day, Kahau and about a dozen of her government officials meet in the tent. Every evening their fold up their tent and go home, returning in the morning.</p>
<p>State officials have largely ignored them, and police have made no arrests. The Hawaiian Kingdom Government has said it has no intention of resorting to violence.</p>
<p>Every week, the Hawaiian Kingdom Government obtains a public-assembly permit that allows it to occupy the grounds of the palace, a museum and popular tourist attraction next door to the state Capitol.</p>
<p>As far as the state is concerned, the Hawaiian Kingdom Government is treated the same as any other group that wants to conduct activities on public ground, said Deborah Ward, spokeswoman for the Department of Land and Natural Resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as they comply with the permit conditions, they may continue to request permits to meet,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is unclear how the organization&rsquo;s members intend to oust the state government. They also want reparations in the form of housing, low-cost health care and cash. The kingdom slapped a $7 trillion fine on the Hawaii state government in 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>My only reaction is: let them go. We no longer need Hawaii and it has always been completely incongruent with the rest of the USA anyway. In fact, it just might be in our best interests to sever Puerto Rico, Guam, Philippines, and all other territories and focus squarely on restoring our nation to its former majesty.</p>

<p>Why not?  If I made my own license plate and put it on my car in lieu of the state-issued plate, I&rsquo;d be arrested. The real Hawaiian state government needs to take a &#8220;handcuffs-on&#8221; approach with these revolutionaries, no matter how small a group they are. Don&rsquo;t these people who are playing government in a tent have real jobs? Why don&rsquo;t they get into the official state legislature to initiate change? This is why; they are the minority and the majority doesn&rsquo;t want what they want! I&rsquo;d like to be a queen, too. I&rsquo;ll tell my governor and our state residents to let me be one. HA, and the media makes this sound like a group to be taken seriously!</p>

			<p>The British have their Official Monster Raving Loony Party, so I suppose it is only fair that someone in the United States has stepped up to the plate.  We haven&rsquo;t had anything this refreshingly silly since Emperor Norton of California died in 1880.</p>

			<p>If they get their islands back, why would they still expect to get reparations also?!?  It`s like that scence in Spirit of St. Louis when the president of the Bellanca Aircraft Corp. agrees to sell Lindbergh an airplane but only on the condition THAT THEY GET TO DICTATE WHO FLYS THE PLANE AND WHERE TO AFTER IT`S BEEN SOLD!!</p>

			<p>It would be a boon to the US if Hawaii left the Union.  They receive more in benefits than they contribute in taxes, always have.  If a true offer of severance were made, however, I wonder if the native Hawaiians would then realize that the Asians would be much tougher than the Americans and that the mainland subsidy would be halting forthwith&hellip;but then it would no longer be our problem.</p>
<p>The first poster in this thread mentioned Puerto Rico.  Yes, they need their freedom.  So do little isolated holdings like the US Virgin Islands, etc.  Freedom!  You betcha.  </p>

			<p>Weird. In Hawaii there is modern liberal pressure to reinstate the monarchy while in the UK there is pressure to dissolve the monarchy and I have seen some articles on the web about a small group of people that want to secede California. I can&rsquo;t figure out what&rsquo;s going on to be honest with all this.</p>

			<p>We should maintain our bases there for military reasons, but I would have no problem with releasing Hawaii and perhaps splitting Alaska into two states.  You know, to keep it &#8220;the fifty nifty&#8221; United States.</p>
<p>Or maybe get rid of California and Hawaii and go back to 48 states.</p>
<p>As anyone who&rsquo;s experienced native Hawaiians can tell you, they are some of the most uneducated students in the United States.  They have bizarre family practices, including a requirement that a particular child in the family be a female.  If nature does not result in that case, families merely tell their male child to act like a woman.  Consequently, Hawaii has one of the highest transvestite populations in America.  It also has the worst performing schools!</p>

			<p>If we, on the mainland, give the blacks any sort of reparations, which it appears the  government may well do, we SHOULD give Hawaii back to them. And then, as suggested, dump Puerto Rico, Guam, Washington D.C. and all the other places that drain the U.S. of resources and money and contribute nothing. And let&rsquo;s face it, Washington D.C. has contributed nothing to the betterment of the U.S. for a number of years.</p>

<p>If the state government was wise, they would take measures to stamp this out before it turns into anything. Of course, that would require them to actually do something, and we can&rsquo;t have that.</p>

			<p>Running a shadow government in the back of a tent somewhere with a &#8216;President&rsquo; or a &#8216;King&rsquo;, or even the Pope himself presiding, still clutching onto the official ring, that&rsquo;s the theme of quite a few stories about Sci Fi and alien invasion. It also looks like the future for whites in America before a very long time. </p>

			<p>I bet they made these same rationalizations in Rome when they abandoned the Roman province of Britain to the barbarians.  The competition between humans societies on this planet is not that much different than the struggle that goes on in your yard between your lawn and weeds.  A civilization is rarely able to maintain a stasis, it is usually expanding or contracting.  Where do you plan on drawing the line when you give up Hawaii, California etc?  Should we drop back to the borders of the original 13 colonies somewhere along the line of the Appalachian mountains?  I mean everything from the original colonies except the Atlanta metro area since we need to cede that as the capitol of the new African republic.  We need to fight for every inch of territory that we have taken.  To retreat is to embolden our enemies.  Get rid of the dandelions and the crab grass now or our yards will become like vacant lots.  </p>
<p>We better start fighting harder for the preservation of the white race by electing the right kind of politicians, ending ALL immigration, and following every legal course of action open to us.  If we fail to educate our friends and families and get more involved legally we will end up having to fight a really nasty and long racial war in this country and that alternative is bad news for all our citizens regardless of race or ethnicity.  There is no place left to run to people it is time to start making a stand while we still have the numbers to do so.   </p>

			<p>   Hmmm, from a secessionist point of view, it might be interesting to see what line of action the feds will take against the native Hawaiians. We all remember what happened when the southern states decided to leave the union. There is nothing that states that a state cannot leave the union, as best as I remember. If I&rsquo;m wrong, somebody please post and let me know where it is in the constitution. I could very well have missed it. The political situation being what it is, I am sure there are many other people around the country watching this all unfold with great interest. They could be watching this and developing their own ideas as an alternative to McCain and Obama. That may sound radical. But then, so does either of those being president of this troubled country. I am not advocating anything, just for the record. I am just stating obvious facts. We are living in troubled times. Alot of people are fearful of the madness in government and the extremely radical left and it&rsquo;s people. Neo-cons and liberals are one and the same. Millions of people are coming to this realization. They are the ones whom still feel the pride of oneself and this former great nation. I feel the sting of tears as I come to realize that the country that I loved and defended, has become the largest third-world nation on planet Earth. It is true that we, the white people, the descendents of Kings and Queens of Europe, have abandoned our responsibilites. We have knelt before the throne of greed and consumerism. We have given up our birth-right for a little false comfort. We are giving up our freedoms for a false security. We are enslaving ourselves and our future generations for promises based on lies. </p>

<p>Remember the government has no money.  All the money it gets, it gets from you, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayers.  So reparations is not the government paying some one, it is you paying the blacks with your hard earned money.  </p>
<p>What will the blacks do with your money?  The same thing they always do.  Spend it on drugs and sex.  The resulting increase in black population will result in an increase in the same troubles that the blacks plagued you with in the first place.  So you will have the same troubles, only more so, and a new welfare and prison bill to pay.</p>
<p>The experts will tell you that because you irresponsibly gave the blacks so much money without properly educating them, you forced them to use it inappropriately and therefore, you are responsible for their misconduct, and now must make restitution. </p>
<p>So after some half hearted objections by government officials, you will pay again.  Have you ever see a TV picture of a guy looking at himself on TV, looking at himself looking at himself on TV.   This gives you a good idea of what paying off the blacks is like.  They will not go away so it goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>Giving Hawaii away is totally different.  It cost you nothing.  You get nothing from Hawaii, so you lose nothing.<br>

			<p>We White people are indeed the descendants of the kings and queens of the highest cultures on earth and yet many of us have either forgotten that truth or else they fear claiming their inheritance for concerns about the &#8220;racist&#8221; labeling. It was White people who made the USA a majestic, desirable SUPERPOWER, and just to remind you all: When Admiral Yamamoto stated that he feared they had awakened a &#8216;Sleeping Giant&rsquo; when referring to America immediately after Pearl Harbor, he was NOT referring to blacks, hispanics, or native Indians. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Enough&#8221; is wise.</p>
<p>We are expanding or contracting, there is no stalemate.</p>
<p>The HKG needs to be taken very seriously.</p>
<p>Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson stated back in 1961 that should the US fail in Vietnam we&rsquo;d fight on the beaches of Waikiki.</p>
<p>He could have been right, just not in the way he thought&hellip;.</p>
<p>Our troubles are not just black and white; there are many shades of brown.  Hawaiians (and blacks) are not the only non-white people that pull apart the fabric of the United States.  I too feel the sting of tears.</p>

<p>Amazing how some people with absolutely no clue can generalize and entire group, I guess that makes all white people back-stabbing opportunists and oppressive to non-whites.</p>

<p>In reality though, at least the Hawaiian Islands DID belong to the Hawaiians, America never belonged to blacks. And the poster is correct, we get nothing from Hawaii or Guam or Puerto Rico OR!!!! Washington D.C. Get rid of all of them, keep Alaska though, it may prove useful.</p>

			<p>Hawaii never should have been made a state. It was just asking for trouble. America is not some &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; outfit you just slap on some random peace of real estate. Hawaii has none of the characteristics or qualities required for statehood. It would have been much better to have gone the other way and given the islands their independence and just obtained a 99-year lease on Pearl Harbor. I also see no advantage to keeping Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>I read through subscribed magazines, that many of the Silver Hills military vehicles are being moved to the Patton Armor Museum in KY and many of the Aircraft are going to the Wright Patterson Museum. I have been there (the Smithsonian) and was terribly disappointed as most things were real small or closed or gone except the (seemed like 2 million Sq Ft) MLK building. Nothing but a bunch of &#8220;African&#8221; art and pics of trouble making marches. That could be moved to Detroit where it might be appreciated.</p>

			<p>In general I like monarchy because it reinforces the centrality of blood ties, kinship bonds, and by extension ethnicity and race.</p>
<p>The British in general did a good job in co-opting non-white monarchs by simply incorporating them into the British class system, with the British Sovereign on top.  (It did cause racial difficulties though, such as the German Emperor Wilhelm II suffering the indignity, while still a &#8220;mere&#8221; Crown Prince during his father&rsquo;s reign, of being inferior in protocol at an event to the King of Hawaii).  Unfortunately as a republic the US can&rsquo;t do that.  In fact the Constitution of the United States specifically provides that the federal government guarantees the states a republican form of government.</p>
<p>Arguably therefore supporters of Hawaiian monarchy are traitors and should be treated as such by the government.</p>

			<p>Glad you like tanks, Skip.  There is a big armor museum outside of Moscow, with the only Maus super-heavy tank remaining in the world.  They have a British Conqueror as well, traded for a late-model &#8220;Stalin&#8221;.</p>
<p>I visited the Patton exhibit in KY in early January 1998 when I was back from Australia to visit my then-girlfriend.  The T-28 is there.  A big beast, with two rows of tracks on each side, like a Bolo.</p>
<p>If you like airplanes, the only surviving Hayate is at Yasukuni.</p>
<p>One of the things I miss the most about Europe is the museums.  The museums in Vienna are glorious.</p>

<p>If you are part of the Royal Monarchy establishment, which I am assuming you are not, therefore you can&rsquo;t claim anything. While true to what you are saying about the benefits of the Monarchy and as to why you like it, I understand, but unless you are Royalty, you can&rsquo;t relish in any form of gloating.<br>
