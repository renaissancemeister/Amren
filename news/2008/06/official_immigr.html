__________</p>
<p>Sure Nancy- as Judge Judy used to say, don&rsquo;t pee on my leg and tell me its raining.</p>
<p>You know darn well crime is going down because the illegals have moved on to neighboring counties or states such as NC, where immigration enforcement is not a priority.  This is the same lady that whined about the Hispanic students leaving the Pr Wm school district in last April.  According to the April 28th article on AMREN, PR Wm county school district anticipated saving $6M by not having the illegals children attending their schools.  It makes perfect sense crime rates would fall, as the illegal parents/uncles/cousins leave as well.</p>

			<p>Liberal explanation: immigrants are afraid to report crimes now.</p>
<p>RATIONAL explanation: Fewer Mexicans = a corresponding decrease in crime. Given that Blacks and Mexicans between them do 90%-95% of all crime in our country.</p>
<p>Now does anyone have any questions?</p>

			<p>This Virginia AP story proves a good point regarding enforcement.<br>
.<br>
Years ago, concering immigration, Congresswoman Barbara Jordan nailed it.   She was the Chair of the U.S. Commission on immigration reform in the HOUSE of Reps.  The Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims reported her findings in February of 1995.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Jordan testified regarding her investigation  and basically put her findings in a nutshell.  &#8220;It&rsquo;s is both a right and a responsibility of a demoncratic society to manage immigration so it serves the NATIONAL INTEREST.&#8221;  She also stood for ending chain migration, ending the idiotic Diversity Visa Lottery program and enforcing strict deportation policies not just for illegal aliens convicted of aggravated felonies and other crimes, but for all border/visa violators.   She opposed welfare programs for illegal aliens and she pushed for real employer sanctions. <br>
  <br>
We can now contrast her views with presidential candidates McCain and Obama, both are in favor of amnesty for millions. </p>
<p> DOES THIS SERVE THE NATIONAL INTEREST?</p>
<p>The costs involved for such amnesties is staggering and will completely change the face of America, and not for the better..</p>
<p>McCain seems to believe that all of &#8220;God&rsquo;s Children&#8221; qualify for this massive amnesty and  Obama is on the same wave length and also believes in unlimited amnesty.  </p>
<p>This, despite the VERY loud and clear voices of most Americans in opposition.</p>
<p>This alone give a compelling indication of just how these two would listen to and represent the views of American citizens.</p>

			<p>Could it possibly be they fear the police because they themselves are criminals? Perhaps we have stumbled onto something, make their lives a living hell, and just maybe they&rsquo;ll go back to the place they&rsquo;ve already destroyed. Naw, I&rsquo;m just dreaming. America would have the lowest crime rate in the world, if there were only whites, do the math.   </p>

			<p>Amnesty is a very very bad idea. Basically you are taking a temporary problem and making it permanent and you can&rsquo;t ever go back and fix it. This is a very very good reason to resist all efforts and amnesty and work politically to end illegal immigration.</p>

			<p>Well of course in a sane society illegals should fear the police and I would go as far as to proposing that cops be paid a bonus of say $250 for each illegal they ultimately capture who is deported to provide that little extra motivation.</p>

			<p>Mexicans Without Borders. The name says it all. I  checked out a few sites and found this among many:<br>
 <br>
<a href="http://socialismandliberation.org/mag/index.php?aid=356&amp;pf=on" rel="nofollow">http://socialismandliberation.org/mag/index.php?aid=356&pf;=on</a> </p>
<p>&#8220;Mexicans Without Borders (Mexicanos Sin Fronteras) is an organization that arose out of the need for migrant workers to struggle against the various injustices that they face in their daily lives. It is for immigrant workers who cannot cash a check, obtain a driver&rsquo;s license, rent a house, travel, or obtain higher education because they lack the proper documents&#8221;</p>
<p>Reading this Mexican Without Borders interview is like taking a trip down memory lane; the bourgoisie, the struggle,the workers, the ruling classes, so many classics of Marxist dialogue from the past. The site did ask for accreditation for it&rsquo;s mag and I&rsquo;m more than happy to do just that:</p>
<p> www.socialismandliberation.org/mag  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t all rush to log on and overload the site folks!!  </p>
<p>These are the kind of people that Nancy Lyall associates with, people for whom The United States of America is an abomination. So much do they want to destroy the success of Capitalism that they cannot even contemplate the notion that illegal immigrants should ever stay in their own country and aspire to drivers licences, education, health care, etc there; it&rsquo;s as though Mexico doesn&rsquo;t exist as a nation state.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m thrilled to read that they are afraid to go to the Police. Good. Let them fear America. <br>

			<p>Many legal immigrants are afraid to call the police. Not because they have anything to fear from the police here in the US but because calling the police the their country of origin wasn&rsquo;t exactly the smart thing to do. </p>

			<p>The majority of hit and run fatalities are cause by Hispanic illegals, because the life of an American is worth nothing to these criminals compared to the possibility of going to jail or being deported.  And the reason many Hispanics don&rsquo;t report crimes to the police is because criminals and the crimes they commit are an accepted and systemic part of Hispanic culture&hellip; </p>

			<p>&#8220;America would have the lowest crime rate in the world, if there were only whites, do the math.&#8221;</p>
<p>This goes along with something I&rsquo;ve been saying. Diversity discriminates against criminally minded WHITES. If you&rsquo;re saying criminals have rights too, the feelings of criminally minded, whites, should be considered too. Do I have to say it? Despite what the media may make real, in the minds of the public, whites who commit crimes are much more likely to be apprehended. That&rsquo;s some REAL bias in the justice system. But I suppose, since they are white criminals, catching them is considered a GOOD thing, and not just a necessary evil or &#8216;just doing my job&rsquo;, sorry. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Mexicans Without Borders&#8221; is a self-contradictory and threatening name for an organization. First, &#8220;Mexican&#8221; makes no sense if there is no &#8220;Mexico,&#8221; a nation with borders. Second, the obvious implication is that the material benefit of mestizos of whatever status is the group&rsquo;s concern. Illegal? No problemo. Mexican first, last and always, regardless of anyone and anything else. And isn&rsquo;t an exclusive concern with mestizos &#8220;racist?&#8221;</p>

<p>Good plan.  I suggest a private citizen get a $250 bounty for each illegal immigrant deported because of their reporting them.  Plus, a $1000. bounty for reporting a business that employs illegal immigrants that is subsequently convicted of that crime.  This could all be funded by fines on the businesses and confiscation of the money and belongings of the illegals.  Californians could make a career out of such bounty hunting. </p>

			<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t the non-availibility of law enforcement one of the incentives put in place by plans against illegal immigration? As in, when you realize that you can&rsquo;t call the cops when someone wants to kill or mug or rape you, and that people who want to do so are more numerous in the general knowledge that you can&rsquo;t, you have a strong incentive not to remain where things are such?</p>

			<p>For a hoot I looked at a message sent to me to join the CBP (Customs &amp; Border Patrol) so many requirements, restrictions such as a seriously handicapping age requirement. On top of all that, along with speaking Spanish, they only offer $50,000 a year for the trouble. hahahahaha no wonder they are so short of people. Maybe they should hire illegals for that too!!</p>

			<p>Nancy Lyall is the typically stupid liberal moron who has a bed of Procrutus mentality. If an action and it&rsquo;s subsequent result doesn&rsquo;t fit the liberal Procrustean explanation of the result, then cut off those parts of the result or hide them, until it fits the liberal explanation. Sick deluded people.</p>
