<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A majority in parliament is opposed to opening Dutch borders to workers from Romania and Bulgaria despite a serious labour shortage.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Minister Piet Hein Donner wants to admit Romanian and Bulgarian workers from 1 January 2009 but parliament, including the main coalition parties the Christian Democrats (CDA) and Labour (PvdA), believe the current problems with Polish workers should be solved first.</p>
<p>The conservative VVD says estimates of the number of Poles who would come to work in the Netherlands were way off the mark.</p>
<p>Instead of the expected 15,000, as many as 1,207,000 Polish workers migrated to the Netherlands, leading to serious problems. The VVD says it ought to be at least another three years before Romanians and Bulgarians are allowed to work in the country.</p>
<p>Minster Donner&rsquo;s own party, the CDA, agrees that the minister is moving too fast, while Labour argues there is not enough housing and the issue of exploitation by slum landlords needs to be dealt with first.</p>
<p>The Socialist Party says the minister is not taking the issue seriously and appears to be living in a dream world.</p>
<p>Towns and cities facing problems providing housing for Polish workers say the government still underestimates the situation.</p>
<p>Some urban councils say the borders should remain closed for longer for new groups such as Bulgarians and Romanians. At present, these nationalities need a permit to work here, and the councils want this situation to remain unchanged.</p>
<p>In 2008, inspectors discovered 170 houses illegally occupied by East European workers.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the city councils will meet Minister Donner to discuss their problems. However, he argues that the government is increasingly successful in bringing the exploitation and illegal accommodation of East European workers under control.<br>

			<p>After proven decades of immigration failure, I cannot grasp the thinking processes of those politicians who continue to press for opening their borders to non-nationals, no matter how dire a work shortage might exist. Repeating errors whilst expecting different results is insanity.</p>

			<p>WOW, they have Muslims Pack raping,  as well as Africans living off welfare and they are complaining about indigenous Europeans entering their country. Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am firmly anti EU and would prefer that all individual European nations keep their culture. However, I find it laughable when a (Mainstream) politician in England, France, Ireland, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, etc, etc, etc, feel the need to speak out about Eastern European immigration. These same (mainstream) politicians bow down to Islamic immigrants in aforementioned countries even when said Islamic immigrants openly discuss the takeover of the respective country. </p>

			<p>There is no such thing as a labor shortage. There is a &#8220;people who will work for nothing&#8221; shortage. </p>
<p>The market cannot allocate resources effectively if there are no &#8220;shortages&#8221;. Companies making products that are barely profitable disappear and are replaced by companies that make better use of labor. This is how things advance in a modern first world economy. The problem is, you usually don&rsquo;t get the super-rich who add no real value to society. To be super-rich in this environment usually means you built a real company that provides real goods and services. You don&rsquo;t just flip stocks back and forth.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see the wisdom (as another pointed out) of denying at least WHITE people from Romania or Bulgaria, and likely Christian also, from coming to the Netherlands but will WELCOME troublesome, RIOTING!! Muslims who are in most cases blacks from we know where. I was recently told that the world famous sex district in Amsterdam is closed at the moment because of Muslim sensibilities (lack there of I say) Is this true?? anyone know?<br>

<p>Exactly:<br>
I bet that half of these &#8220;anti-EU immigrant&#8221; politicians would bend over backwards to double - if not triple - the amount of Muslims, or Africans.</p>
<p>Yes, Mr Muslim proudly proclaiming that &#8220;Islam will overrun Holland&#8221; would be a far better immigrant worker than those Eastern Europeans that *return to their countries when economic conditions improve*, in a few years.</p>

			<p>I love how the main issue for the politicians is housing:</p>
<p>&#8220;Towns and cities facing problems providing housing for Polish workers say the government still underestimates the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a shame that the Dutch have resigned themselves to hoping the government will provide.  In an ideal economy, there would be no excess in labor if the Dutch government were not providing so many freebies.  This is why Muslims come to Europe: they know they will receive government handouts.  The socialist forms of government that Europeans have installed are beckoning to all non-white countries: &#8220;Come!&#8221;</p>
<p>Poles know what socialism leads to, and that is why they jump at the chance to work.  Eastern Europeans want to come and work.  They are white, assimilable christians who come to make a living, not like the arab muslims who have no loyalty to anyone but &#8220;Allah.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Just like the English, these people have begun a total dispossession of the poorest half of their own people by flooding the country with Mohammedans and blacks, and then they get all bent out of shape because some Eastern Europeans come in? </p>
<p>On average, Eastern Europeans are far more conservative culturally and morally than Western Europeans. That alone means that Western Europe needs those Eastern Europeans to save them from their own Liberal culturally suicidal patterns. </p>
<p>Liberal Dutch culture, like Liberal English culture, is at best suicidal. Long live conservative Eastern European cultures - May they ally with the vestiges of conservative Western European cultures against the European Liberal Elites and the Mohammedan and blacks they are using to destroy historic Europe.</p>

<p>Muslims feel perfectly justified at welfare handouts. The majority of them view the Dutch or any other non-Muslim as the infidel so therefore it is ok to steal, rape or leech off off the infidels. <br>

			<p>At one time I would have agreed that Eastern Europeans were good for Western Europe but I&rsquo;m not so sure now.  I&rsquo;m leaning towards the opinion that if you&rsquo;re not Dutch you don&rsquo;t belong in the Netherlands.  The same goes for the French in France or Germans in Germany.  I think the reason there&rsquo;s no strong racial conscience in America is because of the centuries of inter-ethnic breeding among Europeans.  People were encouraged to abandon their strong ethnic identities and adopt an artificial American culture and ethnicity.  Many of us were essentially deracinated.  I think we&rsquo;re starting to realize that this artificial identity is not strong enough to stand up to nonwhite encroachment in our lands.  I think White America would probably be stronger today if it maintained it&rsquo;s separate European ethnic identities along the lines of a country like Argentina.  <br>

			<p>These Muslims are going to nicely fill the previously mentioned &#8220;people who will work for nothing&#8221; shortage because, after they get on the welfare programs &#8220;they won&rsquo;t work for NOTHING&#8221; it is the same in the U.S. Anyone been through customs in France&rsquo;s CDG lately?? in May  their customs was like being in the Congo!! all blacks and shouting back and forth at each other in an African language and a black (british speaking) interpreter moving among them for problems of which there were many!</p>

			<p>I also find it laughable when mainstream politicians cry foul at the current immigration situation, but only seem to target that animosity at fellow Europeans.</p>
<p>My parents came from Spain, and I would like nothing more than a Spain with only Spaniards. HOWEVER, this is not the case, and cannot continue to be, regardless of what people may wish. I much rather prefer a Bulgarian or a Romanian coming to countries in the west. At least we&rsquo;re dealing with Christians from another country on the same continent.</p>
<p>The sickening thing, most of all, is to think that our ancestors fought and died to keep the Mohamedans out of Europe, because they knew, at least instinctively, that this would happen. In the case of the Dutch it&rsquo;s incredible to think that 400 years ago, they fought a series of bloody wars because the idea of Catholic was unthinkable, but now Mohamed is the prince of Orange!</p>
<p>It only proves that white people are good at fighting each other.</p>

			<p>I agree with the above reader - the fear of Romanian and Bulgarian Gypsies, who, for e.g., flooded Italy just after admission of their home countries to EU is probably the cause of the delay. Just google Gypsies and Italy and there&rsquo;s a lot of news about their behavior there, shantytowns, attacks, stealing&hellip;<br>
Dutch have enough of non-assimilable people in their cities and so they use the pretence of having too many Poles already to avoid the invasion of stealing and begging Gypsies.</p>

			<p>Robert at 9:23 PM on June 27 and others have complained that because the Poles are white it makes mass immig. of them okay.  It does not.  Holland and England where I live are both over populated and like all Western countries, have a labour surplus not a labour shortage.  Overly lenient liberal generous welfare policies combined with a cheap labour agenda means loads flood in competing for the same low paid jobs (and housing etc).  This reduces the incentive of both natives and immig.s to work since you get nearly as much on benefits as min. wage and there aren&rsquo;t enough jobs to go round.  This socialism takes loads of money out of the economy (that would have created more work) and densely pop. countries can&rsquo;t expand infrastructure that much.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s different to the mass immig. that built USA (also Canada and Australia) where Poles, Brits and other whites went when there was no welfare state and a huge demand for growth, development.</p>
<p>The only good thing about this is it&rsquo;s increasing the white pop. a bit.  Certainly, the Poles make far far better immig.s than Muslims etc but we need to get everyone born here working first.<br>
Since on average immig.s are more likely to be unemployed, letting them in all the time increases not decreases unemployment.  In UK the Poles are only slightly more likely to be in work than average but with blacks and muslims many times more likely not to be the overall is negative.</p>
<p>Only white S Africans and white Zims as asylum seekers perhaps would be the best immig. policy - gradually bring our own back to save their lives and boost our percentage.  I&rsquo;m sure Poland will be fine . . until they become rich and start letting loads of blacks and muslims in of course . . </p>

			<p>It seems that immigration has suddenly taken over the world. Why have people decided to suddenly invade other countries? They don&rsquo;t come with guns and tanks. They just walk in and colonize. Our own government sits back, silently, and allows illegals from Mexico, Central and South America to waltz in. They only pay lip service to enforcing our laws, and then pick up a few illegals from plants and even few of the greedy business owners who hire them. We may be going from the frying pan into the fire. Both McCain and Obama can&rsquo;t wait to give them the famous &#8220;path to citizenship.&#8221; Why. Workers are one thing, citizenship is entirely different. They will NOT live up to the rules of the oath of citizenship. They are not about to give up their loyalty to Mexico. Don&rsquo;t the Presidential contenders know that?</p>

			<p>Just because there also white doesn&rsquo;t make them worthwhile immigrants. Kick them out. Preserve the different European countries.<br>
All things considered though, it&rsquo;s a bit strange for the Dutch to gleefully accept all these Muslim immigrants and then refuse to accept any from other European nations, I do think Bulgarian and Romanian workers are more useful than say, people from Morocco.</p>

<p>This is true. Mass immigration(whites too) to a fully developed nation is not a good thing(this includes the USA today), especially when it is done to lower wages or when immigrants have to compete with the natives for jobs, government resources etc.. It&rsquo;s also not good if it is in numbers large enough to dilute the national culture.</p>

<p>  There may be an element of truth in what you say. However, the only sanctioned negative publicity allowed against immigrants in Europe is against Eastern Europeans. I suspect that political correctness prevents the controlled European media and loony left politicians from objecting to more &#8220;diverse&#8221; immigrants/refugees that only &#8220;enrich&#8221; their host countries.</p>

<p>True. Again, I fully embrace the idea of a Holland for Dutchmen, Italy for Italians, etc. After all, immigration is only healthy if confronted with depressed population levels AND it also contributes to the racial health of a nation. </p>
<p>The sad fact of the matter is, however, that non-white immigrants continue to flood Europe. This being so, I would rather have white immigrants. After all, a Pole is extremely more desirable than a Nigerian. The EU was crested to form a united Europe. However, until Europe learns to unite along racial lines, and not worrying about the nationality of another European, the white race as we know it is truly doomed on the Continent. </p>
<p>Race first. Nationality second!  </p>

			<p>       All immigration favors the ends of the elite: cheap labor, lack of social cohesion, the weakening of nationalism and<br>
the strengthening of the parental state. How to choose between<br>
groups? Easy, the more alien the better! Maybe someday all these<br>
surplus Whites will be sent as immigrants to destroy Japan and<br>
China.</p>

			<p>Eastern European immigration to western Europe has the same effect in those countries as Mexican immigration to the US: unemployment of native people, lower wages, increased burden on social services, neighborhoods feeling like a foreign country to the native people and higher crime.  Eastern Europe has much higher crime rates than Western Europe.  </p>

			<p>The Dutch have the right to keep out immigrants, even European ones. Besides, most Bulgarians have much Turkic ancestry, and many of the Romanians immigrating are Gypsy, not Romanian, and thus are Indian.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the Netherlands will limit African and Indian and Chinese and all Muslim immigration also.</p>

			<p>One more thing, almost 20 years after the fall of the iron curtain and 5 years of Eastern Europe in the EU, it is hardly more conservative than say Italy, Spain or Portugal. You have plenty of leftists and gays and atheists and far too few Christians. Also, Eastern Europe has lower birth rates.<br>
So Eastern Europeans are not culturally more conservative than Western Europeans.</p>

			<p>I am an immigrant from Eastern Europe and it&rsquo;s not true that we are lowering wages. We want to earn as much as the British, Irish, German. <br>
Besides we are Christian, we love the West, have so many things in common with Western Europeans, share similar values. The only threat to Western Civilization comes from Islam.</p>
