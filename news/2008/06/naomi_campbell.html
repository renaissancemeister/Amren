<h1>Naomi Campbell Gets 200 Hours for &lsquo;Air Rage&rsquo;</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gregory Katz, AP, June 20, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Temperamental model Naomi Campbell was sentenced to 200 hours of community service Friday after pleading guilty to assaulting two police officers after an &#8220;air rage&#8221; incident at Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p>She was also ordered to pay 200 pounds ($400) to each of the police officers she attacked and 150 pounds ($300) to Miles Sutherland, the captain of the British Airways plane she disrupted, in addition to a 2,300 pound ($4,600) fine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Campbell was traveling in first class and became abusive to the captain after he left the cockpit to personally explain to her why her bag &mdash; and those of many other travelers &mdash; had not been placed on the flight.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said she shouted a number of obscenities and tried to kick the police who were summoned to remove her after she &#8220;ordered&#8221; Sutherland to delay takeoff and look for her missing piece of luggage.</p>
<p>At one point, the black model accused the airline staff of being racist and said they would not have removed her from the flight if she was white. She told a white policewoman that the only reason she was being arrested was because she was &#8220;black and famous&#8221; and threatened to sue.</p>
<p>Magistrate Peter Yiacoumi told Campbell that she was getting credit for past good behavior and for pleading guilty at the first hearing, but said the crimes could not go unpunished. Prosecutors said she kicked and spat at police officers, used foul language repeatedly, and had to be removed from the plane.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the past, Campbell has been charged with throwing objects at members of her staff.</p>
<p>Last year, she was sentenced to a week of community service spent mopping floors and cleaning bathrooms in New York City after admitting &#8220;reckless assault&#8221; for throwing a mobile phone at her housekeeper.</p>

			<p>For being white and un-famous the punishment would have been at least 2 years in jail and about $20,000 fine - not to mention the life ruining, job destroying publicity and humiliation that would follow. </p>
<p>Yes, being &#8220;black &amp; famous&#8221; is a cross to bear! We should all have such privilege. Some day perhaps even this stupid &#8220;enlightened&#8221; judge will see things through the eyes of truth. In the meantime, we whites will have to put up with spoiled, black &#8220;entertainers&#8221; and &#8220;models&#8221; being given undreamed of privileges due to their race and due to idiotic white guilt!</p>

 Whoops! Unh-uh! Uh, no. And if you don`t like it then Hun, well here, You fly the plane!<br>
&#8220;because she was Black and famous&#8221;  I`d have to turn this one around. I`d posit that she became famous because she is Black and reasonably  and/or  not too terribly  unattractive. Which makes her a media  darling and a prize peach to hold up to the rest of the free world!<br>

			<p>Naomi Campbell is just another example of unending entitlement at its worst. </p>
<p>She belongs behind bars (where the other inmates might not take too kindly to her chronic temper-tantrums)- not being coddled at a make-work &#8220;community service&#8221; job. </p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t her first public hissy-fit. Why this poor excuse for a human being is still allowed out in civilized society is a mystery to me. </p>

<p>Do you know how much a  pampered &#8220;supermodel&#8221; makes per day?  Even per hour?    <br>
Those fines are, for her, a mere pittance, a joke.</p>
<p>And btw, it seems we&rsquo;ve heard of her name before in this regard!</p>

			<p>Travel in First Class. A life of luxury.  Rich, famous, privileged. With an income and lifestyle that most whites could only dream of.   Yet, facing a minor annoyance, she ends up cursing, kicking and spitting, and acting like a slattern.  <br>
 <br>
Proof once again that you can put lipstick on a pig, but it&rsquo;s still a pig.<br>

			<p>Interesting. You attack somebody and they get at least part of your fine?</p>
<p>In America, you attack somebody and the government gets your fine because the government owns the people.</p>

<p>So the actual victims of her crime get a pittance while the government (which was not harmed at all) gets over four times as much as all the victims combined.  Doesn&rsquo;t anybody else see what&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?</p>

She should count herself lucky!  She probably would have been put on a terrorist list and couldn&rsquo;t fly anymore    &mdash;     a great impediment to her profession.</p>
<p>Btw, I think the  airport authorities  are even MORE grim and severe in Europe. Certainly they have been with me.  But then I&rsquo;m not black and famous.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not an issue of black or white, it&rsquo;s an issue of adolescent out of control behavior. Every single time you hear from this woman, she always has some problem. She needs to be put in prison and do hard time for about 9 months, following a year long anger-management program to calm this woman down. She really needs to understand what patience means, but this is NOT about RACE, it&rsquo;s about Hollywood being brazen and thinking because of their status, they can get away with anything. These people live outside the world or reality.</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t mention her age. Naomi Campbell was famous as a model about two decades ago, if not earlier. </p>
<p>At the risk of seeming facecious (when I&rsquo;m not trying to be), I wonder if menopause has something to do with this. </p>

			<p>I heard, and this may have come from Naomi herself, that her problems stem from the psychological damage caused by the abandonment of her father. She may have even received treatment for this. Now consider the fact that the black illegitimacy rate is 70%. That is 7 out of every 10 blacks born in this country are to women who are not married! Add to this the births in married families that subsequently break up and the number of blacks raised with no father is much higher.</p>
<p>Many black men have &#8216;fathered&rsquo; more than one child by multiple women and many black women have children by more than one black man. Many black women do not even know who the father of their children are. This explains a lot.</p>
<p>Now consider the probable next president of the United States. His paternal black father left the family. Subsequently his black step father left the family. Subsequently his white mother left the family and he was raised by his white grand parents. Based on his own words he admires the black paternal side of his family and resents the white maternal side of his family. That is the white maternal side of his family that loved him, cared for him, provided for him and raised him. What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?</p>
<p>I believe this abandonment is the reason that he has become such a die hard liberal Marxist Socialist. Another reason is that he realizes that blacks cannot acheive and must be &#8216;carried&rsquo; by achievers. I elaborated on this in a post of a different article today.</p>
<p>I believe this abandonment is also what attracted him to the Black Liberation Theology church. Read up on a little bit of James Cone and Black Liberation Theology. Its a real eye opener. Even if we believe his lies about not hearing any of Reverent Wrights rants, he knows what Black Liberation Theology is and he knows that church is a Black Liberation Theology church.</p>
<p>I also believe this abandonment is the reason he associates with such America hating people as William Ayers. This psychologically damaged, abandoned half black (100% identified black) is, in all likelihood, going to be the next president of the United States of America! As John PM often says, &#8220;May God help us all&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The biggest ego to ever hit the catwalk. She is infamous for treating others like peons, and being abusive towards her employees. And she has been doing a lot of complaining lately, that the industry has become racist, because they no longer put her on the cover of their magazines as often. She might have started the business as a teenager, but is now pushing 40, and apparently it has yet to cross her mind that her former supermodel peers have long since retired, and that maybe it is time she do the same? These days, she only gets publicity due to her sorrid behavior. She is bitter that she is no longer the SUPERMODEL she once was, but that SUPERSIZED ego makes her become violent, whenever she isn&rsquo;t treated like the queen she believes herself to be.</p>

  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
Oh, come on now!   Yes, it is a little bit about Hollywood (sort of)   &mdash;   although Naomi as a model isn&rsquo;t exactly &#8220;Hollywood&#8221;.  But it&rsquo;s much more so about race. And particularly about spoiled, indulged, uppity blacks who think they have a god-given right to be pampered..   Don&rsquo;t kid yourself.  Her recent complaints (nearing the age of 40) about racism in the publishing industry and her difficulty in getting magazine covers because of her color (never her age!) have all been about race. Even her rant about the airline&rsquo;s prejudice is about race. (She didn&rsquo;t claim they were prejudiced against Hollywood.)  If you think otherwise, you&rsquo;re in denial. Black, famous, rich, and spoiled are a combustible combination.</p>
<p>Also, have you ever known or worked around any West Indian women?  I don&rsquo;t know why it is,  but a more fiery-tempered, sharp-tongued bunch of  [w]itches is hard to imagine.  And those were just ordinary ones that I&rsquo;ve known.  I&rsquo;d hate to meet a West Indian millionaire who thought she was queen of the universe.  Naomi&rsquo;s former employees could testify more about that (and they have done so   &mdash;   in court).</p>

			<p>I think Campbell&rsquo;s ego is so massive, she fully expects to have the looks to compete against very young models, when she is a senior citizen. She once gave an interview going on about how black skin never wrinkles, and how her Grandmother looked under 35 when she was over 75. I got the impression she was trying to suggest that she would remain camera perfect and youthful, forever. No matter how old she gets, she is simply to vain to admit that she no longer has the dewy fresh looks, that the youth obsessed fashion industry is interested in, and will continue to say she isn&rsquo;t landing any covers because of racism.</p>

			<p>She has apologized to the officers but claims that an employee of the airline called her a racist name. The airline was quick to respond with &#8220;does not accept any allegations of racism.&#8221;  &#8220;We are proud of our diversity.  We fly to 90 different countries around the world and employ a multi-nationality work force.&#8221;  &#8220;We have strick policies concerning dignity at work and have long-standing training programs on diversity and inclusion.&#8221;  </p>
<p>And I belive every word the airline said.  Like every other major corporation in this country and around the world, there is no way that any employee would have dared to use any so-called racist language.  It&rsquo;s the same old spin from another black.  Get in trouble, act like you just arrived from the jungle and when you are punished, pull out the same ole tired excuse.  Like we used to use when we were kids  &#8220;She called me a bad name.&#8221;  Only with the blacks, it&rsquo;s always, they called me the N word.</p>
<p>Do you community service Naomi, pay your fines and shut up?  By the way anybody see the outfit she&rsquo;s modeling in the Sunday newspaper today.  Would somebody please tell me who the in hell wears this stuff?</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a little ironic how now that she is longer the hot thing on the runway, (and hasn&rsquo;t been for years) that she is now screaming about racism at every turn. When earlier on in her career, she was treated other black models like dirt. Tyra Banks was a major threat to her position as *the hot black model* in the late 80&rsquo;s and early 90&rsquo;s. She went out of her way to sabotage her- telling designers she would not get on the runway if Tyra was there too. She has always been a self-absorbed drama queen. But lately, she appears to be coming unhinged. She trashed her millionaire boyfriends yacht, attacked numerous hired help. And for some reason, her weapon of choice is always her cellphone. She is truly out of control these days. Maybe too many years of wearing a tight weave on an increasingly growing big head have made her a little crazy.</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re right. The alleged insult doesn&rsquo;t ring true - it would be professional suicide for an airline employee to use an insult of that kind. They know better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting that the allegation was made to Sky, not the police, and seemed to emerge rather late in the day.<br>

			<p>She should be very, very happy this was not prosecuted as the federal felony it technically was.  I spent three years in federal prison for something I *said*, but as a political dissident who collected firearms, I should have known better.  As a spoiled rich gal, Campbell should have had a few extra Bloody Marys.</p>
<p>Airline crew are usually very, very nice.  I wore long hair and a big, bushy beard in Australia, and looked a bit like the wild man from beyond the black stump.  I also brought home a World War One Barr &amp; Stroud optical rangefinder I had bought at an estate sale (along with a really rare artillery slide rule) when I came back for Christmas to visit my girlfriend in Kentucky.  The security folks in Sydney were all ex-military, and knew what a rangefinder was, so they let me onto the concourse, though it was painted olive drab and looks like a rocket-launcher.  The United folks were concerned when I boarded, and suggested I check it for the cargo hold.  I told them it was an optical instrument, and that I was afraid it would get broken.  They let it fly in the cockpit.  The captain gave it back himself, and said &#8220;1918?&#8221;</p>
<p>The flight from LAX to Denver was even more interesting, as the airport security stopped me, but couldn&rsquo;t speak English, so I waited on the concourse while the Phillipna (?) summoned her boss.  I demonstrated to the supervisor how it worked, taking a range on a taxying airplane.  I was given no trouble on boarding.</p>
<p>Ten years later, I still have it.</p>
<p>My own recepie for air travel is an allergy pill and two Bloody Marys.  Out like a light, even in &#8220;screaming baby&#8221; class, except once when I was eating pistachio nuts and playing cribbage with a Korean gal, while her husband slept.</p>
<p>If you speak calmly and politely, most folks will help you, even including airline staff.  There is enough that can go wrong with an airplane without passengers&rsquo; attitude problems entering the equation.  It is a pure shame that the other passengers didn&rsquo;t give Campbell a prolonged attitude-adjustment seminar.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Tyra salvaged her career by becoming a swimsuit and lingere model, through Sports Illustrated and Victoria&rsquo;s Secret, but Naomi was successful at keeping her off the runway of many well known designer shows. Tyra even confronted her about it on her show not long ago. Tyra was still emotional about it, but Naomi acted like an ice queen, all haughty and arrogant as usual.<br>

			<p>*It&rsquo;s not an issue of black or white, it&rsquo;s an issue of adolescent out of control behavior. Every single time you hear from this woman, she always has some problem.*</p>
<p>Campbell does indeed have behavioral problems! But, she is the one who constantly makes things a black and white issue. When she has was of her diva-like temper tantrums, and violently attacks her employees, or Airline Captains, or Flight Attendants, or even the Police, she turns around, and says she only caught flack from it, because of her race. There are also very few models strutting the catwalk or landing on the cover of Vogue magazine, that are nearing 40, but instead of calling it a case of ageism, she calls it a case of racism instead. More likely because such a megalomaniac that she likes to see herself as some ageless goddess, that time will never touch like other mere mortals. She is not only unstable, but a first-rate racecard user.</p>

			<p> It has been reported she screamed in outrage when she learned her bags were missing, while her fellow passengers also had missing bags, still remained stoic and quiet. She shouted get the press, get my lawyer! When the Captain attempted tried to calm her down, she shouted at him, How dare you tell me what my options are, you aren&rsquo;t leaving until I find my f  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   bags. When he walked away, she shouted back to him &#8220;You are a racist&#8221;!  She also shouted she had a Yves Saint Laurent outfit, she planned to wear to an interview, and once again threatend to sue if it were not recovered. </p>
<p>This woman clearly thinks the world revolves around her, and that when she is not satisfied she has every right to throw a major tantrum, and physically assault anyone who sets off that infamous temper. When it is all said and done, she always claims it was racially motivated. She&rsquo;s absolutely disgusting.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is true or not&hellip; but there&rsquo;s a story about Naomi Campbell being in Hawaii, going to a restaurant, and demanding a table that someone else is already sitting at. An altercation ensued. The girl in question pushed Naomi down and that was the end of it.</p>

			<p>Why does anyone pay attention to a screaming a**hole like this?  Men, don&rsquo;t go out with her.  Magazines, don&rsquo;t hire her.  Maids and personal assistants, don&rsquo;t work for her.  First class passengers, insist on being moved if she is seated next to you.  Airline pilots, walk past her if you see her screaming about missing bags.  Airport employees, calmly refer her to the person designated to deal with angry passengers, who is hopefully behind a plexiglass window.  </p>

			<p>On a later national TV interview where she apologised with big bovine eyes looking at the camera to try to gain sympathy, she alleged that one of the British Airways flight crew called her a &#8220;Golliwog supermodel&#8221;, and the first time she said such a thing since the fiasco she caused.  I believe that she should be banned from flying on all national carriers for flight safety reasons so she can charter in future, something more in line with her &#8220;status&#8221;.  And she should then soon run out of cash.  If she does the same tricks again,there are always handcuffs kept on board for those who need them.</p>

Yea, but the millions of dollars she made, she made on her own, in her pocket, has nothing to do with color, so you want to take credit, for everything that she achieved in life? That is so absurd and childish, Granted, I am not a big fan of hers and that being said, I think, she needs to cool her heels down for awhile&hellip;like in a prison cell, preferably San Quinton. She is rich, she has the right to enjoy herself anyway, she wants to, as long as it&rsquo;s within the law and she doesn&rsquo;t bother people. Other than that, more power to her.</p>

I notice you say  &#8220;men she HAS dated&#8221;,  &#8220;magazine covers she HAS been on&#8221;&hellip;..  Maybe so, in the past, but why is she complaining so much lately about the fact that she isn&rsquo;t getting jobs and she seems to be not in much demand any longer?  Could that account for her bitchyness?</p>
<p>(I notice too that the Naomi Campbell fan club seems to be in operation here!)</p>
