						<p>Police in Norway have arrested a Gambian-born man and charged him and his wife with subjecting five of their six daughters to genital mutilation, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The practice, also known as female circumcision, is outlawed in Norway and arouses horror among many people in the West but is a rite of passage for young women in many countries, predominantly in Africa.</p>
<p>The youngest of the five mutilated girls, all born in Norway, is five years old, police officials said. The others are aged seven, 10, 13 and 14 and live in Gambia, national broadcaster NRK reported.</p>
<p>Police officer Hanne Kristin Rohde, head of the violent crime and vice section of the Oslo police, said on Norwegian commercial television TV 2 that the father &mdash; a naturalized Norwegian citizen along with his wife &mdash; was taken into custody on Friday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The child protection authorities have taken custody of the two youngest girls, Rohde said, adding that the police would now seek to bring the other four back to Norway in cooperation with the parents and Gambian and other Norwegian authorities.</p>
<p>U.N. agencies say an estimated 100 to 140 million women and girls worldwide have undergone genital mutilation, whose proponents say it promotes chastity before marriage and fidelity afterwards by reducing female sexual desire. Around 3 million a year are believed to be subjected to it.<br>

			<p>By all means&hellip; let&rsquo;s keep importing third-world primitives into White Nations. We NEED this kind of cultural diversity. We wouldn&rsquo;t hardly want to become set in our complacent ways, would we?</p>
<p>Just think. The MORE immigrants accepted by White nations&hellip; The more we get exposed to such different cultural practices. Like the one above. Like &#8216;harvesting&rsquo; organs and body parts of newly sacrificed children&hellip; to aid in voodoo and black magic rituals. Cannibalism. Inter-tribal killings. Honor killings. Rapes of White women for not conforming to dress codes prescribed by other religions.</p>

			<p>I am a white teacher who wanted to go to Norway to teach English; it is the home of my ancestors.  I was highly discouraged by their educational systems that offered English language teaching jobs to native English speakers and was given excuses galore.  So how did the Gambians get in?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone speculate that this may be a good practice for the races that use it.  There must be some reason that they have developed it.  We know that black girls reach physical maturity at a much younger age than whites, and having less impulse control, tend to &#8216;scratch the itch&rsquo;.  The results are the epidemic of teen mothers in the American Ghetto.   Maybe this practice has helped the countries where it is common to maintain something approaching normal mating habits.  The northern parts of Africa, where the practice is common, are certainly much more advanced and civilized than the center and the south, where it is not. </p>

<p>because some do-good sponsor paid their way.  </p>

Posted by at 5:58 PM on June 10</i></p>
<p>Many have asked such a question and in relation to East European countries too such as Ukraine, for example, where there are various African and Asiatic nationals in occupation, replete with race related vested-interest associations and organisations already set up there as incredibly as it sounds.</p>
<p>Norway, like Switzerland, quote,</p>
<p><i>&#8220;is not a member of the European Union at present, <br>
but is required to adapt EU legislation in most policy areas because it has signed the EEA free-trade deal through EFTA. Additionally, Norway has chosen to opt in to many EU projects such as the Schengen Agreement, Europol, Eurojust, EU Drug Monitoring Centre, Frontex, the European Defence Agency and the Union&rsquo;s battlegroups.[1] Whether or not the country should apply for full membership has been one of the most dominant and divisive issues in Norwegian political and economic debate since World War II.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway_and_the_European_Union" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway_and_the_European_Union</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, the European Union is an extension of the New World Order, of which the United Nations is one of its main monitoring AND enforcement agencies.  It&rsquo;s the United Nations, the majority membership of which consists of non-white Third World countries, that is in charge of worldwide immigration and asylum affairs, and it is these non-white operatives in the United Nations who have been empowered by white renegade enablers, who are flooding our lands with their Third World dross.</p>
<p>The extent of just some of these hideous NWO plans can be pursued here.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union#Caribbean" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union#Caribbean</a></p>
<p>Unfettered Third World immigration shall continue unabated unless war between two or more non-European Union nations of the West breaks out in the very near future.</p>
<p>The survival of the world&rsquo;s white ethncities, their respective homelands and Western civilization are now in such a perilous and very probably terminal state, it would be in the interests of the better positioned both politically and financially, to engineer just such a turn of events since for the white Western world at this juncture in time, it would be infinitely more honourable, admirable and dignified to end its collective agony by its own hand.</p>

			<p>Remember this when thinking about muslim arab countries, &#8220;Men are for recreation; women are for procreation.&#8221;  They only have sex with women in order to have children in most cases, so they can&rsquo;t have them wanting to have intercourse on a regular basis.</p>

			<p>Actually, the correct name for this procedure is a clitoridectomy. There are two types of this operation:</p>
<p>1.) The Sunna method, in which the tip of the clitoris is removed, and;</p>
<p>2.) The radical infibulation, in which the entire clitoris is removed, as well as both pairs of labial lips being removed.</p>
<p>It is practiced in Muslim nations, in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.</p>

<p>This is one case where I wish there was an option on Amren self censor or edit ones own postings.  My previous comment above on this article was improper and not reflective of the reality of the article.</p>
<p>I apologize to everyone for making it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some of the European Left snidely comment on christianity in America and claim that we are overly religious yet these same people support islamic peoples in their country who are a million times more conservative than the most conservative american christian fundamentalist would ever be. I&rsquo;m no christian fundamentalist but no christians fundies here support female circumcision, stoning or anything else. It&rsquo;s amazing really because islam goes against everything women&rsquo;s rights, gay rights etc. that the Left stands for.</p>

			<p>Whiteplight, <br>
You are a civilized gentlemen for considering whether your comment was appropriate. <br>
But I wouldn&rsquo;t be concerned. I am sure everyone understands the idea. It&rsquo;s true. The Multi Cultists are so crazy, they may try this next. You were not inaccurate at all. The Libs really do try to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; all kinds of third world cultural practices that are repulsive and destructive to human dignity and rights. </p>
