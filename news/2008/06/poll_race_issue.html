<h1>Poll: Race Issue for 1 in 5 Voters</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, June 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If Barack Obama&rsquo;s got so many issues going for him in the presidential election, from the economy to war fatigue to a national hunger for change, how come John McCain is so close to him as their race begins in earnest?</p>
<p>Early polls suggest the contest is so competitive at this point largely because of how people view the personal qualities of Obama, the Democrat, and McCain, the Republican.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that people are considering, from the way the candidates look to how long they&rsquo;ve been around to what they think. Or at least what voters think they think. Here&rsquo;s a look at what polls say about why the contest is so close, and what each candidates&rsquo; advantages might be:</p>
<p>RACE: On an issue many are reluctant to discuss frankly with pollsters, the country&rsquo;s reaction to Obama&rsquo;s drive to become the first black president remains a wild card. Early indications are the Illinois senator faces important obstacles.</p>
<p>He trailed McCain among whites by 6 percentage points in a Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll this month, and 9 points in a Pew Research Center survey in late May. That&rsquo;s not bad for a Democrat: No Democratic presidential candidate has won the white vote since exit polls of voters began three decades ago, and only Bill Clinton even came close.</p>
<p>But there are danger signs for Obama. In a poll early this year by The Associated Press and Yahoo News, just 43 percent of whites said they view blacks favorably. In this month&rsquo;s NBC-Journal poll, one in five whites said the candidate&rsquo;s race would be important in deciding their vote. Nearly half of whites said they could not identify with Obama&rsquo;s background or values, and more than one in three disagreed with the idea that he cares about people like them.</p>
<p>Some open questions about how much these findings matter: How many of the whites who are uncomfortable with Obama&rsquo;s race would vote against a Democrat anyway for other reasons? How many of them live in states like those in the South where Democrats seldom win? And on the other side of the ledger, how many additional blacks and liberal whites will vote who otherwise may not?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Poll doesn&rsquo;t mention whether race is an issue for black voters.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because only whites can be bad.  <br/>

			<p>*In this month&rsquo;s NBC-Journal poll, one in five whites said the candidate&rsquo;s race would be important in deciding their vote.*</p>
<p>Notice how it&rsquo;s *very* subtly placed after the &#8220;just 43 percent of whites view blacks favourably&#8221;?<br/>
The assumption here is that the &#8220;one in five whites&#8221; that *do* mention race as &#8216;a factor in deciding their vote&rsquo; *view Obama in a negative light* - I&rsquo;d really like to know if they asked the &#8220;one in five&#8221; if they would vote *for* or *against* him due to his race.<br/>
I&rsquo;d hazard a guess that at least half of those &#8220;one in five&#8221; are the &#8220;Gee, it&rsquo;s about time we gave a black man the Presidency&#8221; braind-dead types.</p>
<p>*Nearly half of whites said they could not identify with Obama&rsquo;s background or values*</p>
<p>Again - outside his (Islamic, anti-white, Communist) &#8216;background&rsquo; - how are Obama&rsquo;s &#8216;values&rsquo; (and the &#8216;white&rsquo; impression of them) have anything to do with &#8220;dem raciss Ytz&#8221;?</p>
<p>This is probably one of the worse &#8220;whites that don&rsquo;t vote for Obama are RACIST&#8221; fluff-pieces released so far.</p>

			<p>Polls aren&rsquo;t that accurate.  People are polled almost exclusively in large metropolitan areas and almost never in small towns or rural areas.  I&rsquo;d probably say 2/3 of Whites think race is an issue in the election, whether they admit it or not.  This poll by itself spells real trouble for Obama if 20% of Whites in these multicultural &#8220;paradises&#8221; won&rsquo;t vote for him.  Of course, the popular vote is meaningless in an American election anyhow, it&rsquo;s the electoral college that counts.  Can Obama secure enough electoral votes to win?  I don&rsquo;t think so.  He didn&rsquo;t win a single one of the big blue states except his own Illinois.  Clinton carried California, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York plus the big red states like Texas and Florida.  The big question is not if these voters will defect to McCain but how many.  </p>

			<p>Of those 43% who view blacks favorably, how many have ever met a black in their life?  How many have only met high IQ blacks in some obscure high-tech job and assume all blacks are like the one black they know?  How many are just lying?</p>

			<p>Wow, some more of the let&rsquo;s shame &ldquo;wicked old whitey&rdquo; into voting for this mulatto Marxist propaganda! So come the questions, of the &ldquo;enlightened and tolerant&rdquo; pigs from of all places, Newsmax.</p>
<p>1.) &ldquo;How many of the whites who are uncomfortable with Obama&rsquo;s race would vote against a Democrat anyway for other reasons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple, not a single decent one; there will be whimpering and simpering hunks of multicultural white toe cheese that would never vote for a Democrat like him if he were white, that will vote for him simply because he is black, but not the reverse. Those that are uncomfortable with his race and despise the Marxism of Democrats in general, will likely vote against him with more relish than a Vlasic pickle factory. This is probably the stupidest question I have ever seen in print.</p>
<p>2.) &ldquo;How many of them live in states like those in the South where Democrats seldom win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now stereotypes and bigotry are directed against Southern whites, with the typical ignorance and arrogance of the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media that we all know and of course &ldquo;love.&rdquo; It would be refreshing if this comment were meant to indicate that whites were more sensible and patriotic in the South, but we all know that this is not the case. It is just one more Northern dominated media hit at the chaw drooling and hog calling &ldquo;hillbillies&rdquo; and &ldquo;rednecks,&rdquo; that they find so fashionable to denigrate. However, these lisping and sashaying media sophists could learn a thing or two about decency and manners from Southerners, if they had the grace and brains to model them, instead of ceaselessly mocking and disparaging them.</p>
<p>3.) &ldquo;And on the other side of the ledger, how many additional blacks and liberal whites will vote who otherwise may not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah yes, the heart warming image of the &ldquo;disaffected&rdquo; and &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; unifying and coming out in swarms, like some avenging terrestrial army of  street angels. For once, the hedonism, stupidity, and outright laziness will give way to a &ldquo;greater cause.&rdquo; This cause being a buttressing of the entrenched multicultural elites&rsquo; zeitgeist in human form, a General Secretary Obama. Good luck there comrades, you are really going to need it.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Poll doesn&rsquo;t mention whether race is an issue for black voters.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it does not, and that&rsquo;s outrageous, especially since Jeremiah Wright we now know that so many blacks literally despise whites.</p>
<p>The big problem in this country today is non-white racism, but our side has too many spinless whites in politics and the media to dare raise it as an issue, as it should be.</p>
<p>Disgusting.  Such a lack of courage by these wimps. </p>

<p><br/>
Lol&hellip;..those dummies at Newsmax just don&rsquo;t get it.  Many, if not most of the issues they track as being left vs right, are actually race issues.  Only they are too cowardly to say so openly, even if many of them are starting to break through the brainwashing leftists have subjected us to.</p>
<p>The important point of this article only tangentially has anything to do with Obama.  It&rsquo;s not that widespread negative views of blacks, among whites, spell disaster for his campaign.  It&rsquo;s that those negative things whites know (or suspect) about blacks are almost universally true.  More and more and MORE, whites are becoming aware of the situation.</p>
<p>Obama is doing a fine job of awakening whites to racial consciousness.  The leftists really miscalculated with him.  Like all blacks, he&rsquo;s a marxist black supremacist.  But unlike most black candidates, he looks normal, acts normal and it seemed like they could sneak him in under the radar to further the leftist progressive religion.  Much to their dismay, all of the skeletons are popping out of Obama&rsquo;s closet and everyone is finding out just how big of a wacko he really is.</p>
<p>But Obama is no wild eyed Louis Farrakahn, screaming in front of the cameras that aliens took him to the mother wheel ship to clue him in on the white man&rsquo;s sinister plans (at least we don&rsquo;t have film footage of him doing that&hellip;..yet).  No.  Obama is the normal, respectable black man.  The one we all went to college with.  The one that acts just like us and allows whites to believe a fairytale that most blacks are like that and only a handful of bad apples are gang banging in the ghetto.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a carefully crafted mask.  A lie that just didn&rsquo;t exist in any form until recently.  Underneath, those people hold values that would make most of us recoil in horror.  </p>
<p>And Obama is doing a fine job letting whites see what&rsquo;s really under that mask.  Make no mistake.  There are still waaaay too many whites in dangerous, deep denial.  But large numbers of whites are seeing the truth.  And they don&rsquo;t like it one bit.</p>
<p>I think, win or lose, the Obama campaign is the beginning of the end for the cult of leftist progressivism and a dramatic acceleration of white awakening racial consciousness.</p>

			<p>According to the thinking of many in the mainstream media anyone who does not vote for Obama is a racist. And this despite the fact many simply realize the man is not qualified to be president because of his lack of any kind of legislative accomplishments, experience in forgeign affairs or proposals of innovative solutions to our country&rsquo;s many problems. Saying he stands for &#8220;change&#8221; is meaningless. What change? Being in favor of late-term abortions isn&rsquo;t change, its advocating brutal murder of the defenseless. Saying he would sit down with ruthless despots for talks isn&rsquo;t change, it&rsquo;s simple mindenness. Advocating all but open borders isn&rsquo;t change, its a policy to destroy the most successful culture in history. Wishing to give drivers licenses to illeglas isn&rsquo;t change it a license to kill. Wanting to send billions in aid to Africa isn&rsquo;t change its money Americans can&rsquo;t afford and will again prove no amount of money will ever solve the problems there becasue there are simply too many. If I were convinced Obama would seal the borders, make every effort to restore our manufacturing base, limit foreign aid, develop an ultra urgent program to make us energy independent and fight to preserve our traditional and unique American idenity I&rsquo;d vote for him no matter what color he was, and I&rsquo;m sure millions of others would too. But everything I see of Obama I don&rsquo;t like, and its not his race. So I&rsquo;m going to hold my nose and vote for McCain. </p>

			<p>Vlad,</p>
<p>I agree with you.  If it came down to the resume, policy plans and a track record of success then I&rsquo;d vote for the candidate who represented my values no matter their genetic group.  But all this &#8220;you&rsquo;re racist if you don&rsquo;t vote for Obama&#8221; tripe has energized me to vote for McCain, a man, I don&rsquo;t really like.  I&rsquo;m tired of the Obama cult and those who mindlessly swoon before him hence my vote for McCain.  Look at it this way too. McCain being that he&rsquo;s 71 I believe will probably only serve out 1 term.  Whereas if Obama were in charge, the media would cover for him, no matter the damage, and he&rsquo;d likely serve out 8 years, 2 terms as President.</p>

<p>Me, too. The way I see it, the country is screwed. We are not going to vote our way out of the mess we&rsquo;re in. From here on out, I&rsquo;m holding my nose and voting a straight Republican ticket. That will at least buy some time for the Second Amendment so that conservative whites can stockpile as many arms as possible in preparation for Civil War II. As far as liberal whites are concerned, I&rsquo;m going to love seeing them face the machetes after all they&rsquo;ve done. I can&rsquo;t wait. </p>

			<p>I think the Republicans need to be taught a lesson but I too will be voting for McCain, not that it&rsquo;s that much improvement over Obama.  It&rsquo;s still possible that the Democratic Convention won&rsquo;t nominate Obama in August.  He comes across as an incredibly weak candidate with no real platform spouting buzzwords he reads from a teleprompter.  The Democratic Party is still fractured after the primaries.  I don&rsquo;t care what Clinton said during her concession speech, her secret police are working overtime digging up some kind of dirt that would throw the nomination her way.  I don&rsquo;t doubt that several high ranking Democrats are also working to derail his candidacy.  <br/>

			<p>The most liberal of liberals is a racist, everyone is a racist.  The first thing that anyone reacts to or decide that they will not react to is skin color and facial characteristics.  It is fundamental psychology.  All the discussion about racism is dishonest and nothing more than a political tool that races grapple over.</p>
