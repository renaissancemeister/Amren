						<p>Indicted U.S. Congressman William Jefferson said he will run for re-election this fall despite an impending federal trial.</p>
<p>Jefferson sent out a press release Tuesday to announce his intentions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will run on my record of effective service to the people of my district over the years and in particular over the last three years since Hurricane Katrina.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jefferson has been indicted on federal bribery charges and his trial is tentatively slated to start late this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jefferson said he is not deterred by the prosecution.</p>

											<p>
							<i>Politico, June 4, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>The brother, sister, and niece of indicted Rep. William Jefferson (D-La.) were indicted themselves today for allegedly skimming hundreds of thousands of dollars from non-profit groups they controlled, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>&#8220;U.S. Attorney Jim Letten said the family members used several non-profit and for-profit companies to obtain grants designed to help pregnant teens, at-risk youths and others in need of assistance. They allegedly deposited some of the grant money into personal checking accounts and used it for personal expenses.&#8221; the AP reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;A federal grand jury indicted New Orleans tax assessor Betty Jefferson, her brother, Mose Jefferson, and her daughter, Angela Coleman, on charges that include federal program fraud, identity theft and conspiracy to commit money laundering.&#8221; Betty and Mose Jefferson potentially face hundreds of years of prison under the 30-count indictment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Documents released by DOJ in Rep. Jefferson&rsquo;s case claim that the veteran Democratic lawmaker involved multiple family members in his alleged criminal scheme, which involved proposed bribes to a Nigerian official in return for a potentially lucrative telecom contract for a firm secretly controlled by the congressman. Despite video of Jefferson reportedly accepting $100,000 in payments from an FBI informant, and an FBI raid on his house which yielded $90,000 hidden in the freezer, Jefferson has insisted he is innocent.</p>

			<p>Exactly how does Jefferson plead innocent to the FBI&rsquo;s findings of $90,000 in CASH in Tupperware containers in his freezer? No one could match the comedic value of these &#8220;frozen assests&#8221; or &#8220;cold cash&#8221;, but what kind of defense is forthcoming from his camp? An FBI plant and frame-up scheme reminescent of the O.J. defense? <br>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal?  This is just business as usual.  An indictment is just the cost of doing business.</p>

			<p>William &#8220;Refrigerator&#8221; Jefferson must certainly be a hero to the black criminals and welfare cases he &#8220;represents.&#8221; 90k in cash, hidden in the freezer? That&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; it real.</p>

			<p>I think Jefferson&rsquo;s chances for reelection are probably good when we look to the example of DC Mayor Marion Berry.<br>
Berry, as Mayor, was convicted of a drug charge and served a 6 month jail sentence.  When he got out he ran for DC&rsquo;s city council and elected.  He then ran again for mayor and was elected again.   What Jefferson has in common with Barry is a majority black constituency.  <br>
However, it probably should be noted that Jefferson, D-La., was indicted Monday on federal charges of racketeering, money-laundering and soliciting more than $400,000 in bribes in connection with years of trying to broker business deals in Africa.  Jefferson also involved members of his family in his crimes and they have also be indicted.<br>
Despite what appears to be a very strong case, his chances for reelection are still probably strong in his district.<br>

<p>But for those who don&rsquo;t want them elected, to point the above fact would equal to racism and hate.<br>

			<p>My money is on this &#8216;thug-in-a-suit&rsquo; easily winning re-election! We all know that blacks love blacks who beat the &#8220;White establishment,&#8221; even when it drags their &#8220;communities&#8221; down. Detroit and D.C. are good examples!</p>

			<p>I predict a big win for William Jefferson.  Plenty of blacks like criminals who show &#8220;the man&#8221; that they won&rsquo;t back down.  A federal conviction made Marion Barry a hero among his constituents.</p>

			<p>The voters in his district will certainly send him back to Washington, if for some reason, such as being in prison, he&rsquo;s not available, they will send someone just like him.</p>

			<p>And of course he will be re-elected again because the blacks will never consider another alternative. He&rsquo;s black so he has to stay in office seems to be their dogma. Never mind that he is nothing but a criminal &amp; has discrased his office.</p>

			<p>Even if there was a conviction, anyone wanna bet what the first executive pardon of Pres Obama will be? and of course Mr. Jefferson will have been re-elected and thereby further increase Obamas voter base.</p>

			<p>He will probably be elected just as Ted Kennedy continues to get enough votes in MA - year after year these politicians, many of whom whould be in jail, go on pulling the wool over the eyes of the voters. I can see them now, laughing at just how stupid we are.</p>

			<p>People who vote for this soon to be criminal consider his coming conviction as a badge of honor.  This is how blacks always react when their leaders are caught involved in corruption or any crime.  He could have been convicted of mass murder and they would still vote for him.  Does anyone remember mayor Marion Barry of Washington DC who was caught in a drug sting while mayor?  I think he was doing cocaine with a prostitute==his famous words being &#8220;the bi-ch set me up&#8221;.  He was subsequently reelected to the city government as an assemblyman.</p>
<p>White norms of behavior simply do not apply to blacks.  This has been shown over and over again.  Thus, I am never surprised when black elected officials are reelected after having been found guilty of criminal activity.  I think that blacks view such convictions as the nefarious work of &#8220;the man&#8221;, as a kind of badge of honor.</p>

			<p>This stuff is just too funny. It cannot be taken seriously. If the people in Jeffersons district want him, let them have him. I remember the sight of this clown being helicoptered into his flooded house to retreive the &#8220;dough&#8221; from the refrigerator. Come on! Even Hollywood couldn&rsquo;t dream this stuff up!!</p>
