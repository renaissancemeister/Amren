<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>With immigration rapidly changing the face of European and Dutch society, some leaders are looking to confront rising racial and class divisions through solutions rooted in the American civil rights movement.</p>
<p>In Amsterdam&rsquo;s diverse Oud West neighborhood, where roughly a third of students come from households where neither parent has the equivalent to an American high school diploma, a pilot project is being floated to integrate increasingly segregated schools based on a model used in cities such as Boston, Seattle, and Little Rock, Ark.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The schools&rsquo; increasing segregation is a consequence of the country&rsquo;s ongoing demographic transformation, say experts. According to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 19 percent of residents in the Netherlands were born abroad or had at least one parent born abroad, and 6 percent of the population is Muslim.</p>
<p>Nearly a third of residents in the country&rsquo;s four largest cities &mdash; Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht and The Hague &mdash; are from non-Western ethnic groups.</p>
<p>There are large immigrant communities from former Dutch colonies of Suriname, Indonesia, and the Dutch Antilles, and significant populations of Moroccans and Turks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 2007 study by the Open Society Institute characterized 10 percent of neighborhoods in the four major cities as &#8220;concentration neighborhoods&#8221; disproportionately made up of minority populations. One-third of immigrant households said they were dissatisfied with their neighborhood. A survey found that two-thirds of the native Dutch population had little or no contact with immigrants.</p>
<p>Oud West and its 3,200 children ages 12 and under were a prime target for the pilot project. Opulent homes run along the neighborhood&rsquo;s southern border, the Vondelpark &mdash; Amsterdam&rsquo;s version of New York&rsquo;s Central Park &mdash; with poorer immigrant communities to the north and west. Three of Oud West&rsquo;s six primary schools are considered &#8220;concentrated schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the controlled-choice setup, parents visit local schools and rank their top four. The system then tries to give parents their preferences while balancing demographics such as race, class, and parental education level in all the schools. Sometimes it factors in other variables such as gender and proximity, and whether a potential student has siblings in the school.</p>
<p>Critics of controlled choice say it pushes middle- and upper-class students out of the targeted schools, further detracting from the overall quality of education. Another concern is whether the model is transferable from the American to the Dutch education system.</p>
<p>An added complication to the Oud West project is a strong, closely held Dutch tradition of full parental choice in their children&rsquo;s schooling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Policymakers are treading lightly as they seek public support. &#8220;In Holland this is a big deal, the parents&rsquo; rights for choice,&#8221; says Ms. Coffeng. &#8220;You need strong evidence that this will work and strong politicians. We cannot force it on people, but I think it is going to happen.&#8221;<br>

To the contrary, all of this ethnic replacement is basically being forced upon people. When were they ever given any real choice?  The pretense of choice (in small matters) is just more window dressing.</p>

			<p>Integration can work much better in Europe because the minorities there do not include such a large percentage of blacks. In the so called melting pot of all the different races, blacks are like the metal tungsten:highest melting point, and most refractory, if you know the  meaning of that word.</p>

			<p>In Europe, there is an idea that racial diversity has been wildly successful in America.  I know that sounds ridiculous to everyone who reads Amren, but it&rsquo;s often trotted out in the media and by politicians to put pressure on European people to surrender to the third world invasion.  </p>
<p>Neocons and other mainstream conservatives are often guilty of claiming that mass third world immigration is working out great and that third world immigrants are assimilating into American culture and good for the country.  We only have to listen to people like George W. Bush, Karl Rove and John McCain or read the Wall Street Journal and Weekly Standard to hear that kind of nonsense.  </p>

<p>Whoo, I knew the Dutch had some good stuff for sale on the streets of Amsterdam in the way of drugs, but I didn&rsquo;t know the Ruling Elite was &#8220;smokin&rsquo; and tokin&rsquo;&#8221;&hellip; otherwise, why in heaven&rsquo;s name would they EVER believe that forced bussing, lowering IQ tests, working to &#8216;raise self-esteem&rsquo; and all the other smokescreen tactics used for over 40 years, could EVER integrate non-Europeans into the &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; of Dutch society.</p>
<p>It sure has not done so here in the USA; it has only destroyed our culture, and posited an &#8216;anti-culture&rsquo; of crime, sexual disease, depravity, and rape.</p>

			<p>I myself believe the Christian Science Monitor takes basically a pretty liberal Bostonian perspective on diversity and open borders. <br>
I myself strongly suspect that Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, did not have this kind of emphasis on these particular values. It would be interesting if someone did a little investigation/study on the matter.</p>

<p>Those Europeans are probably being led to believe that integration is working in the US by looking at the US Army stationed in Western Europe. The Army has the option of cherry picking the talented tenth, whereas cities like Detroit end up with all of them. Even when skimming off the top 10% the Army still has racial problems.</p>

			<p>Forced integration always means that the white working class is forced to integrate with the black (or in Europe, Islamic) minority.  The elites never impose it upon themselves.  Judge Garrity, who ordered forced busing on Boston, lived in suburban Wellesley, which was never subjected to busing.</p>
<p>Busing was a complete failure, if you believe its intent was to raise the educational level of blacks.  If its real purpose was to cause white flight and hand over most of the city to non-whites it has to be regarded as a success.  I hope the European voters realize this before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

			<p>I can tell the Netherlands exactly what is going to happen because it happened here. They&rsquo;ll integrate these schools, the schools will become unsafe, run down hellholes, hence white flight. The whites will live in the suburbs to get away from it all and white taxpayers will spend huge sums trying to make these lousy hellhole schools into something successful. It will fail of course and the minorities will blame the Dutch for the bad schools that THEY themselves created, scream racism and eternally hit the Dutch up for more money to make their schools work, which will be never. </p>

			<p>When America had its&rsquo; racial problems in the 60&rsquo;s,  Europe was pretty much lily white. As such, Europe looked down its&rsquo; nose at the problems in the US because europeans had no experience with and thus no understanding of blacks, muslims etc. and were very naive because of this. Europe thought that blacks/muslims etc. as a whole, were just like whites and innocently thought that  the only reason for the problems with blacks or black failure in the US was that white americans were so racist. Europe figured that they were &#8220;non-racist&#8221; and their welfare states would take care of any black/muslim etc. and as such, these groups wouldn&rsquo;t fail.  Europe let millions of immigrants in and is now very diverse. It is also finding out reality the hard way. Nothing like a huge dose of diversity up close and personal to wake you up.</p>

			<p>To be fair though, you Americans are much better at getting people jobs, than here in Europe I&rsquo;m also pretty sure that black africans are better at assimilating (intermarrying, that is), than arabs or other middle easterners. It&rsquo;s just my personal experience, though.</p>

			<p>I think Europe is in the position that the US was in the 50&rsquo;s and early 60&rsquo;s. Since that time European&rsquo;s have loved pointing the finger at the US re race relations etc. </p>
<p>But now Europe has it&rsquo;s own sizable minorities:- and Europe can look forward to riots, bussing, affirmative action, an explosion of crime, white flight &hellip; we can see the beginnings already.</p>

			<p>Yes, the few Europeans with whom I still come into contact still believe white Americans are pretty much responsible for black failure.</p>
<p>OTOH, I have recently run into two white female teachers who were turned from liberal-to-not-so-liberal in the space of 18 months to two years. They have both left their urban teaching posts, taken salary cuts, and gone Catholic.</p>

			<p>So how much is all this going to cost?  Is this cost (and the cost of Dutch students murdered, raped, mugged and harassed) going to be factored in as they ponder the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of diversity?</p>
<p>Just from the top of my head, here are some of the costs of immigration to a European nation:</p>
<p>1) Greatly increased crime<br>
2) Educating those immigrants<br>
3) Medical care for those immigrants<br>
4) Social services - which immigrants use at a higher rate<br>
5) Teaching the immigrants Dutch and/or English<br>
6) &hellip; and now integrating those immigrants</p>
<p>Each one of those certainly costs millions of dollars (billions in some cases).  Assuming all the above is done successfully, what is the final result?  Destruction of Dutch society and its replacement by alien peoples.  Can somebody list concrete financial or social benefits that would offset the above?  Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me that the Dutch will be better prepared to deal with a multicultural world!  Don&rsquo;t you get it?  There WILL BE NO DUTCH!!  But not to worry; there will still be Hutu and Tutsi and Bantu and Han Chinese.  There just won&rsquo;t be any distinct European peoples and that IS the real goal of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and immigration, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			<p> &#8220;They&rsquo;ll integrate these schools&#8221;</p>
<p> They&rsquo;ll disintegrate these schools&hellip;</p>
<p>The word integrate means to coordinate segments into a smoothly functioning unit.  It starts with a rational assessment of those segments.  This rational assessment is called, ahem, discrimination.<br>
Discrimination leads to integration- anti-discrimination leads to disintegration.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Integration&#8221; is another language corruption/thought control device from thy usual suspects.  It slyly implies being the opposite of disintegration- who would favor disintegration?</p>
<p>&#8220;Integration&#8221; to-day means just lumping dissimilar segments together, without making distinctions.  It would be like throwing parts of a machine into a box, and claiming that &#8220;integration&#8221; had occured merely by the parts being in the same box.</p>
<p>If all peoples were put in a giant blender, with the start button to be pushed by Clinton, would this produce integration, or disintegration?</p>
<p>Same process when the word prejudice was replaced with discrimination.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In Europe, there is an idea that racial diversity has been wildly successful in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Growing up in England in a 99% + town, that is very true. Or was.</p>
<p>As a child 20 or more years ago, I was under the impression from shows like sesame street and various other &#8220;urban educational programming&#8221; that was imported in vast amounts to childrens TV in the UK in the early eighties, that the U.S was at least 50% black, all races lived in perfect harmony and the massive amounts of gun violence the U.S has always been famed for were just an unfortunate remnant of the wild west.</p>
<p>And as a human who was born racist as all are, I began to question my beliefs from instinct and experience that the darker races were just not compatible with my civilised society.</p>
<p>I thought, if the U.S being majority black is so rich and successful, perhaps blacks really are an asset to any nation, perhaps England needs more so we might compete with the U.S.</p>
<p>Of course shortly after this I stopped watching Sesame st and grew up. And now having experienced the U.S first hand I realise its success comes inspite of its ball and chain black population and without this violent, leeching, millstone cancer hanging round it&rsquo;s neck, the U.S.A would be a Paradise of European culturalm advancement.</p>

<p>  Your right Joe. The United States which used to stand for freedom in the world  &mdash;  the original intention of the Statue of Liberty  &mdash;   now stands for radical equality, diversity and multiculturalism. Until the United States is in some sense discredited, the madness will continue. </p>

<p>              Similar propaganda was meted out by these same outlets to the Rhodesians about Kenya which being a good example of Whites living under black rule. The Rhodesians were misled by those lies and paid a price. Will Europe make the same mistake?</p>

<p>This is so true. European TV, just like its&rsquo; American counterpart, is run by, for all intents and purposes socialists, who carefully present the picture they want to. Sure, some blacks are intelligent decent and sucessful people but they don&rsquo;t show you the large part that aren&rsquo;t. European TV doesn&rsquo;t tell europeans that here in the USA </p>
<p>-blacks commit crimes or violence against whites at 139 time the reverse<br>
-blacks rape white women at 300 times the reverse(the reverse very rare)<br>
-blacks are responsible for most american gun violence<br>
-blacks are responsible for most of the no-go areas in the US urban cities<br>
-blacks destroy any school or neighborhood they move into by ghettoizing it through their behavior</p>
<p>This despite the fact that american blacks have a higher annual income, more spending and political power than blacks anywhere else in the world.<br>
