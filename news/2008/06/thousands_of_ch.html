					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Hope, Telegraph (London), June 10, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tens of thousands of illegal Chinese migrants cannot be deported for crimes committed here because China is refusing to take them back, say prosecutors. </p>
<p>The loophole has emerged following the case of a Chinese illegal immigrant who cannot be sent home despite acting as a salesman for one of Britain&rsquo;s biggest counterfeit DVD operations.</p>
<p>Hong Guo, 20, was caught in a &ldquo;warehouse&rdquo; in London containing 40,000 DVDs. She is a failed asylum seeker who arrived here two years ago and has no right to work or claim benefits in Britain.</p>
<p>Although Hong&rsquo;s deportation was ordered yesterday, prosecutors said it was unlikely she would return home because China will probably refuse to take her back. Jason Bartfeld told the Old Bailey: &ldquo;The problem is with China and Vietnam. They are not accepting their nationals back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge hearing the case said it was likely that because she could not be deported she would return to her criminal ways.</p>
<p>Judge Anthony Morris told Hong: &ldquo;As you are not permitted to work and are not entitled to benefit it seems to me inevitable that in due course you will return to work in similar enterprises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officials from the Federation Against Copyright Theft (Fact) said that she would probably return to work with Chinese criminal gangs within days.</p>
<p>Eddy Leviten, a spokesman for Fact, said there were tens of thousands of Chinese people working illegally in Britain &mdash; and very few were ever sent back to China. Because they are illegal immigrants, most have destroyed their identity papers. China, therefore, disputes their identity and nationality and refuses to accept that they are Chinese.</p>
<p>Mr Leviten said: &ldquo;It is very, very frustrating both from an investigation point of view and from a police perspective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tories yesterday called for Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, to &ldquo;explain what is going on&rdquo;.</p>
<p>David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said: &ldquo;It would be outrageous if this Government was letting other countries say they will not take their own citizens back because of their criminality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hong was arrested on Nov 2 last year when police raided a house in Stamford Hill, north London. They seized about Â£120,000 worth of DVDs of films currently in cinemas.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the UK Border and Immigration Agency denied that there were problems deporting criminals.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;We can and do return people to China and Vietnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biometric visas have been rolled out to more than 100 countries, including China and Vietnam, tying people to one identity, whilst foreign nationals will soon be required to carry ID cards.&rdquo; </p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s a cop-out.  Of course they can be returned to China.  A national leader with any guts would fly them over Chinese territory with parachutes and push them off the airplane.  If the Chinese then have the audacity to complain, the answer would be &#8220;they&rsquo;re YOUR nationals.  YOU deal with them&#8221;.  But that assumes politicians might have guts.</p>

			<p>This should be a wake-up call to those nations who suffer from illegall immigration, but with all the traitors in places of power in most Western Nations, it won&rsquo;t be.</p>

			<p>Why exactly is this a problem?  Dump them into the ocean a couple of miles off the coast of China and let them swim home.  If the Chinese let them swim ashore, or not, is their decision to make.</p>

			<p>Every nation should demand that China take its criminals back and if not then trade will be cut off.  Hit them in the pocketbook and you&rsquo;ll get their attention.</p>

			<p>The solution is simple, stop accepting immigrants from China from here to eternity. The difficulty of the solution is putting it into effect. </p>

			<p>GPS + old freighter + Chinese Criminals + PRC Flag = Unstoppable Ship into Shanghai. What are the Chinese going to do, sink a ship of their own citizens in their own territorial waters????</p>

<p>Correct, this is the only way. We could give them the choice of letting them go home or dumping them in antartica.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Tens of thousands&#8221;????  This should silence the disturbingly large number of white Americans who feel that &#8220;all Chinese immigrants are great people&#8221;.</p>

<p><br>
Probably would.  That PRC doesn&rsquo;t play games, look at Tianamen and Tibet.  After the first sinking, the outcry from pro-immigrannt groups would be so loud, deportation would never happen again.  The Chinese know this as well.  They win either way.  The West &#8220;cares&#8221; too much and the Chinese, well, not at all.   </p>

			<p>Yet another clever ruse baffles the pig-headed, hide-bound minds of Britain&rsquo;s supposedly &#8216;best civil service in the world&rsquo;.<br>
The solution is of course to imprison these people indefinitely until they volunteer to go.</p>

<p>This is in the UK however there is no way the US could pull off such a thing. We are basically owned by China. All China would have to do is dump our dollars and it would sink us as we are so in debt to them.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t let the US liberals get wind of this.  They will say that the United States should open its arms and take in Britain&rsquo;s illegals. </p>

			<p>A simple solution would involve dumping these miscreants on the grounds of their nations&rsquo; embassies, and refusing to accept ANYONE from these countries, even on legitimate visas.</p>
<p>The other solution costs less than a postage stamp, but is considered impolite in Britain, except when the SAS does it to Irishmen.</p>

			<p>A way must be found to compel China to comply with her international obligations as applies to the rest of us.</p>
<p>By way of a further option, being as treasonist native white pro-immigration activists are the primary criminals, we should commence targeting these for round up followed closely by all illegals and every non-white criminal wherever born regardless of ethnic origins.</p>
<p>Detention centres should be built in wilderness regions like deserts from which there would be no escape other than through death.</p>

			<p>  I don&rsquo;t blame the Chinese for not wanting their criminals back. However, I would suspend legal immigration from China until they did agree to take them back. However, maybe some Third World African country could be bribed to accept them  &mdash;  this would be penalty enough for these obnoxious lawbreakers. </p>

			<p>These are the people who won&rsquo;t take White South Africans back? I think they may have lost too much good blood on the battlefields of France to survive&hellip; it&rsquo;s like when you cut off a chicken&rsquo;s head and it takes a while for the body to stop flapping around. </p>

<p>And one day when Argentina wants it back&hellip;well&hellip;ok.</p>
