						<p>The probe into the Rev. Al Sharpton&rsquo;s finances intensified this week, with the IRS sending out a flurry of subpoenas to his most generous corporate donors, The Post has learned.</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch, the brewer of Budweiser and Michelob, confirmed yesterday that it received a federal subpoena in connection to its charitable giving to Sharpton&rsquo;s National Action Network.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sharpton blasted the subpoena as a &#8220;fishing expedition&#8221; and said his donors are proud of their financial support. The St. Louis-based corporation donated between $100,000 and $499,000 to NAN in 2007 alone, according to its Web site, but declined further comment about its relationship with Sharpton. A knowledgeable source said several other corporate donors received or would soon receive subpoenas.</p>
<p>Sharpton himself, his business entities and his nonprofit civil-advocacy group owe millions in back taxes, documents show.</p>
<p>The IRS and the US Attorney&rsquo;s Office in Brooklyn have an ongoing probe into Sharpton&rsquo;s finances going back to his 2004 run for president and stewardship of NAN.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As of 2006, the most recent year that financial documents for the group are publicly available, it owed $1.9 million in payroll taxes and penalties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>News of the fresh subpoenas comes just days after The Post chronicled Sharpton&rsquo;s relationship with some of the country&rsquo;s largest corporations.</p>
<p>Sharpton threatened boycotts or protests against corporations while simultaneously soliciting donations and sponsorships of NAN events, The Post detailed.</p>
<p>Personally, Sharpton owes $931,397 in federal taxes and $365,558 in New York City taxes, according to an IRS lien.</p>

			<p>And just how is NAN different from the NAACP? Why do they need two &#8220;civil rights&#8221; organizations?</p>

			<p>Anyone want to bet that there&rsquo;s a vast amount of money from these donations that ended up in Al&rsquo;s pockets? I wouldn&rsquo;t be suprised if almost all of it did. I think Sharpton&rsquo;s way of shaking down big companies for donations with the veiled threat of making them out to be racist if they didn&rsquo;t has finally caught up to him. He&rsquo;s an extortionist, pure and simple, and I think he became so blatant about it that the wrong people got wind of it and that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s being investigated. Perhaps there is someone with common sense in the administration after all. </p>

			<p>This is one of the more enjoyable articles I have seen in awhile. It is long past time Sharpton pays for framing that innocent DA with Twana Brawley (or whatever she calls herself now). That time he was able to use his minority privilige to avoid penalty, but, with a little bit of luck, not this time.</p>

			<p>Somehow I think that if I got anywhere vaguely close to owing the IRS $931,397, I would have already lost my house, my retirement plan, etc. and/or be in prison somewhere.  The same goes for state taxes.  It is as if Sharpton lives in another world that the rest of us can only imagine.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s some hopeful precedents here. Remember that Al Capone went down for tax evasion when no other charges would stick.</p>
<p>Actually, I have to qualify this by noting that compared with Sharpton, Al Capone was an honest American businessman who simply provided a product that millions of other Americans were being denied by a sanctimonious and inept government. Aside from little lapses   &mdash;   like the one in the garage on Clark Street in Feb. 1929   &mdash;   Capone would always try to buy off his foes rather than resort to violence.</p>
<p>Sharpton has never done any shooting but I can&rsquo;t wonder if casting false accusations is the next worst thing to murder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pity that Alcatraz, one of the places where Capone was imprisoned, won&rsquo;t be open to receive Sharpton.</p>
<p>Still, any day that this media-enabled hustler and bully gets his reward will be like Christmas, the 4th of July, and my birthday all rolled into one. </p>

<p>I owed less than $8000 once (I paid it) and was harassed and threatened by the IRS repeatedly even though I was making payments as directed and on time. This experience of mine is how I know that a judgement against you is NOT appelate to the higher courts, and the high courts CANNOT overturn an IRS judgement (maybe things are different now) but in the late 70&rsquo;s the IRS was untouchable. They could trample a citizen at will but obviously, not black citizens. I ask again, does anyone know in what luxury the Rev. Al and Jesse live in?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the Stephen Pagones case was eventually settled ( I didn&rsquo;t read this in the MSM any where, did you?).</p>
<p>Larry Elder writes: </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip;This did not stop Reverend Al Sharpton, who accused Pagones an assistant district attorney, of the crime. &#8216;We stated openly that Steven Pagones did it. If we&rsquo;re lying, sue us, so we can go into court with you and prove you did it. Sue us &mdash; sue us right now.</p>
<p>Pagones did. After receiving death threats, and threats against his child, Pagones sued Sharpton and two others for defamation. A jury unanimously concluded that Sharpton defamed Pagones, ordering Sharpton to pay $65,000 to Pagones. The Reverend  promptly announced his intention not to pay. A couple years later, Sharpton&rsquo;s buddies passed the hat and paid off Sharpton&rsquo;sdebt, which totaled $87,000 with interest and penalties. To this day, never having paid one penny of his own to Pagones, Sharpton refuses to apologize, &#8216;I did what I believed&hellip;.They are asking me to grovel. They want black children to say they forced a black man coming out of the hard-core ghetto to his knees&hellip;.Once you begin bending, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;did you bend today?&rsquo; or &lsquo;I missed the apology, say it again.&rsquo; Once you start compromising, you lose respect for yourself.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.larryelder.com/ascrimes.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.larryelder.com/ascrimes.html</a></p>
<p>And yet this man is still revered by foolish White elitists and given a national spotlight by the MSM to pontificate about race relations.</p>
<p>Let me into the asylum.</p>

			<p>If you happen to be in New York City, take a look<br>
where the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Alfred Sharpton lives:<br>
360 Madison Avenue, in Manhattan&rsquo;s &#8220;Silk Stocking&#8221;<br>
district(aka, the &#8220;Upper East Side&#8221;). And we might<br>
even ask him what divinity school he matriculated at<br>
(Answer: None). Fraud, writ large.</p>

			<p>This may seem strange, but in a way I admire &#8220;Rev.&#8221; $harpton! I wish WE had a $harpton to speak for us. He NEVER backs down and grovels to ANYBODY!! And his statement &#8220;once you start compromising, you lose respect for yourself,&#8221; is something that most Whites would never think. You see, compromising for Whites is a way to show they&rsquo;re not &#8220;racissss!&#8221; I want to throw up when I see grow White &#8216;men&rsquo; boo-hooing to &#8216;rev.&rsquo; Al for forgiveness for their &#8216;racissss&rsquo; ways!!</p>

Great news! But I&rsquo;m surprised the Post missed the opportunity to quote one of Sharpton&rsquo;s all-time Greatest Hits:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I or any other black pay taxes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the IRS may be explaining that to Da Rev right now, feel free to tell him yourself at:</p>
<p>Al Sharpton <br>
680 Madison Avenue <br>
New York, NY <br>
10021</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t use too many big words, it&rsquo;ll only confuse him. I plan to stick to mostly to words containing only four letters, myself.  </p>
<p>And for those unfamiliar with NYC, let me point out that 680 Mad is in the East 60s, in heart of the WASPy, old-money, Upper East Side   &mdash;   and FAR FROM HARLEM or any other bajiggity neighborhood. </p>
<p>Also, please note that the 10021 ZIP Code has the distinction of having the HIGHEST PER CAPITA INCOME in all of the USA. That&rsquo;s right: richer than Beverly Hills 90210, richer than Bel-Air, richer than ANYWHERE.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard an abler rhetorician than Sharpton, and if not for the extreme harm he does, I would enjoy listening to his extremely skillful performances.</p>
<p>That the left, and the major media, have accepted this skilled liar as a spokesman, says all one needs to know about the integrity of those two groups.</p>

Thanks! and I will make a trip by there next time I am up there. My wife and I intend to go see the Museums and statue of liberty (how about giving that back to France?)and now the Revz house, all of which have cost the tax payers of the U.S. horrendous amounts of money and suffering (not the museum of course)</p>
