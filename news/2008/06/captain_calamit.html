				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Urmee Khan, London Telegraph, June 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Stuart Hill is preparing to declare himself the head of a new state off the west coast of Shetland</p>
<p>Mr Hill settled on the island after his failed solo attempt to circumnavigate Britain in a home-made boat</p>
<p>Stuart Hill, a 65 year-old grandfather, will announce that &lsquo;Forvik&rsquo;, an island officially known as Forewick Holm, has broken away from the United Kingdom, quit the EU and become a crown dependency.</p>
<p>Mr Hill said his declaration of a new state &mdash; measuring one hectare (2.5 acres) &mdash; is intended to force the government and local council into action over the island&rsquo;s history and constitutional legitimacy.</p>
<p>Mr Hill, originally from Manningtree, Essex, settled on the island after his failed solo attempt in 2001 to circumnavigate Britain in a home-made boat &mdash; earning the &lsquo;Captain Calamity&rsquo; name &mdash; capsized west of the Shetland islands, the UK&rsquo;s most northerly island group.</p>
<p>Like many Shetlanders, he believes the islands, colonised by Vikings in the ninth century, have a distinct identity and share a closer bond with their cousins in Norway, rather than with Edinburgh or London.</p>
<p>Mr Hill has called for the 22,000 inhabitants of Shetlands to declare independence from the UK. His says the case rests on a deal struck in 1469 when the King of Denmark, King Christian, effectively pawned Shetland to the Scottish monarch King James III to raise money for his daughter&rsquo;s dowry.</p>
<p>According to Mr Hill, since the loan was never repaid and no other legal agreement signed, Shetland has remained in a constitutional limbo and should be a crown dependency like Isle of Man or the Channel Islands.</p>
<p>This week Shetland council challenged the crown estate, the property portfolio associated with the monarchy, over the agency&rsquo;s control of Shetland&rsquo;s seabed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a basic injustice that has continued for hundreds of years and has resulted in Shetland being cheated out of the oil money because the UK has appropriated the seabed without any prior right or title,&#8221; Mr Hill said.</p>
<p>Mr Hill is building the first and only permanent building on Forewick Holm from polythene sheets, laminated wood, hardboard and turf, all anchored down by a fishing net to guard against the gales.</p>
<p>Although he has no support with his idea and his residence has no planning permission, he said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s all jolly good fun&#8221; and &#8220;Every pensioner should do something like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the months to come Mr Hill plans to print his own stamps, raise his own flag and even mint his own currency, solid gold coins to be called &lsquo;gulde&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Historians and legal experts have said there has been major constitutional changes from 1469, Shetlanders are part of the UK and Scandinavian kingdoms have no legal claim to the islands .<br>

			<p>Something very similar to this was in the news recently also but it was an island with a population of one.</p>

<p>Socialist: &#8220;[I]f they don&rsquo;t get of town we kill the women, men, children, lesbians, faggots &hellip; god damnit kill them all&hellip; . Why kill the babies? They are just innocent blue-eyed babies &hellip; . Kill them now! Kill the white women. Kill em all god damn it&hellip; &#8221;  </p>
<p>Ever read the lyrics of the bling, blinged-up rappers. Similar vicious, anti-white sentiments. Do you recall the Jeremiah Wright rants? Ever read about racist La Raza members advocating the genocide of all gringos? Did you know Henry Kissinger once called soldiers &#8220;dumb, stupid animals&#8221; showing an absolute hatred of a specific group of people.</p>
<p>These people and groups of people are highly rewarded with money, &#8216;prestigious&rsquo; awards, high  profile jobs, and tax-exemptions for their untoned-down, uncamoflaged racist, mostly anti-white rants. Do they fear being banned to some obscure island? No. They do not. </p>
<p>Do you know what is interesting? Most, if not all, of the above-mentioned people and groups of people are socialists or communists.  </p>
<p>HAH</p>

			<p>Socialist,</p>
<p>Some of us race realists wish there was a place like this for us to go where coercive, statist thugs could not prohibit us from practicing freedom of association. BTW, your term &#8220;camoflage&#8221; (sic) is a neat camouflage for &#8220;political correctness&#8221; which of course is sacrificing truth to not hurting feelings?</p>

			<p>How long until African &#8220;migrants&#8221; somehow start coming ashore on this guy&rsquo;s little island, asking for refugee status from his country?  Long ago, in response to some other story, I made a joking remark that if there were one white man left in all the world, on a tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic, the third world would still clamor to get to him.  This guy better be careful not to publicize his new nation too much.</p>

<p> The most remarkable thing about Socialist&rsquo;s post is the consistency of the threatening mindset of people like him/her. A real gem of entrenched Socialist thought.  I wonder if s/he ever considers that people with different viewpoints are just as valid as human beings as s/he is.  I doubt it, because as with the schoolyard bully, the street thug or workplace creep, the use of threats is Socialism&rsquo;s only answer. As is evidenced by the above post, and as we here have seen in previous posts from Left-wingers, s/he makes no attempt to enter into a discussion about other people&rsquo;s concerns unless; No, for Socialist at 5:41PM there is only one answer, and that is to shut us up. <br>
 This is not new amongst Left-wingers, not only do we have recent examples of people in European countries being jailed for speaking out about issues of race and immigrant crime that don&rsquo;t gel with the government dictates, but  we have decades of examples from history of Socialism&rsquo;s solutions for dissident speech or thought. Lets look at a few:  The USSR comes to mind where dissidents were sent to the Gulags and Salt Mines of Siberia, millions died, The Nazis preferred camps where they could be put to work for the National Socialist cause, Auschwitz, Sobidor, Treblinka and more, millions died.  Then we have the fat dictator Mao over in China who sent millions of his fellow citizens to live and work in pig farms, mines and re-education camps for years if they demonstrated any kind of opposition to his mighty plans; millions died. Or how about North Korea? that paradise of Socialist ideology, where yes again, millions died - and are still dying. N. Korea, where human rights investigators are banned, ever wonder why Socialist 5:41PM? Closer to home in tiny Socialist Cuba,  not having much space to incarcerate dissidents, St. Fidel finds a bullet serves Socialism just dandy.  East Germany, Burma(Myanmar), Vietnam, Rumania, Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, on and on the list goes of the joyous Socialist nations where political or social dissidents were given a public voice and were at liberty to express their views.<br>
 So there ya go Socialist 5:41PM, plenty of examples for you to study on how to make us &lsquo;tone down or at least camouflage!(our) message&rsquo;.</p>
