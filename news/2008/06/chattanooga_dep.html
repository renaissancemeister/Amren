<h1>Chattanooga: Deportations Rise With Tighter Enforcement</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>PTimes Free Press (Chattanooga), June 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The deportation of illegal immigrants is on the rise, according to immigration officials who attribute the record numbers to increased enforcement.</p>
<p>Deportations in the first five and a half months of fiscal year 2008 were higher than in all of 2001, according to U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement figures. In all of 2001, 116,202 immigrants were deported. To date in 2008, 119,429 immigrants have been ordered to return home, records show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Scott Sutterfield, assistant field office director in the Office of Detention and Removal in New Orleans] credited &#8220;fugitive operations teams&#8221; and a program that cross-designates state and local officers to enforce immigration laws for the increased number of deportations.</p>
<p>For many immigrants, the deportation threat of coming to the United States is worth the risk, said one 42-year-old native of Honduras who works in the Chattanooga area.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But increased immigration enforcement has created anxiety in the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those who support a more secure border and stricter enforcement of current immigration laws argue that the number of deportations remains small compared to the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States, estimated at 12 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The majority of immigrants deported nationwide are from Mexico, followed by Honduras and Guatemala, federal figures show. The majority of Hispanic immigrants in Chattanooga are from Guatemala, followed by Mexico, according to organizations that work with the community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From January to April 2008, there were 575 deportations, almost twice as many as in 2006. Last year, on average, there were 100 people returning to Guatemala on a daily basis, said Beatriz Illescas, consul general of the Guatemalan Consulate.</p>

			<p>We need to see numbers in the 1000s. More needs to continue to be done to make up for the nothing that has been done for so long. Make some headway now because it might be another 8 years before anyone takes any iniative. </p>

			<p>A lot of people do not think about or do not even want to think about how much fuel, water and land 25,000,000 illegals consume. Do we have to wait until we have no water to drink before it opens people eyes to the fact that Jose from T.J. and his family, who are here illegally are not only consuming our life blood, but will be the first to kill Americans to get that last drink of water. Think about what the future brings to the meek and weak who are afraid of offending someone by speaking the truth.</p>

			<p>Why would illegal aliens pay any attention (or obey) a court order to return to their own country?? they clearly have no respect for the law anyway. We should follow Kuwaits&rsquo; deportation laws, if you get caught illegal in the country you are taken to the border and put across it or imprisoned (and Msulim jails are NOT hotels)you may be killed the next time.</p>

			<p>The number of DEPORTATIONS compared to illegal immigrants in our country are miniscule. No other word fits.</p>
<p>Too much of these bally-hoed deportations are more like smoke and mirrors. Meant to get those nasty-minded White American voters out of the politicians&rsquo; hair. This is, after all, a Congressional as well as a presidential election year. Natcherly, the incumbents hoping (praying) to be re-elected can be counted on to point to this token effort and crow to their constituents about how hard they they worked   &mdash;   &#8220;to secure our borders and deport the criminal illegal aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congress   &mdash;   both House and Senate   &mdash;   are populated by self-serving shysters. You&rsquo;d be doing good to find an even dozen HONEST politicians in the lot. These same weasels bragging to their White constituents about their efforts&hellip; can be counted on to tell a variant on the theme to their Latino voters. &#8220;I&rsquo;m doing all I can, to keep your people from being deported.&#8221;</p>
<p>My dream for a &#8220;government of the people, by the people, and FOR the people&#8221; would be to see enough gallows erected on the Mall in front of the Capitol Building&hellip; to hang the whole traitorous lot (excepting that handful of relatively honest politicos). With Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s gallows occupying the place of honor. At the front of the lot.</p>

			<p>I have been saying to friends and family for a while now that something is going on.  While I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on it, I just know from deep within me that something is being orchestrated to bring America, as we know it, down.  I believe it&rsquo;s being done by people within our own government, as well as by rich and powerful people both here and abroad.  They want to turn us into a third world country.  They&rsquo;ve been systematically doing this for about 40 years, more or less.  They&rsquo;ve hit us from every direction:  lowered the education standards, enforced diversity and multiculturalism, allowed illegal aliens to come here and take advantage of our healthcare/welfare systems, allowed American &ldquo;baby-making machines&rdquo; to leech off of the public dole as well, enforced affirmative action, diminished our sense of national pride and unity by allowing the use of the hyphen between one&rsquo;s ethnicity and the word &ldquo;American&rdquo;, and these are but merely a few of the things that have been rammed down our throats.  Think about it:  no other country that I can think of, save for our &ldquo;valiant&rdquo; Western European brothers and sisters, would ever allow any of this to happen in their country.  With the exception of America and our Western European relatives, no other country will allow for hordes of immigrants, (both legal and illegal), to come into their country and systematically take it over.  This new wave of immigrants, (Mexicans, Central Americans, Cubans, and Haitians for the U.S., and Muslims for Western Europe), have absolutely no desire to assimilate into our countries.  Instead, they&rsquo;ve carved out substantial portions of both our cities and rural areas.  In effect, they&rsquo;ve created countries within countries, and are even importing their own version of &ldquo;justice&rdquo;, (i.e. Islamic Sharia law).  Americans, and Western Europeans, with common sense have been warning about the lasting damage this type of unchecked immigration will have on our countries for generations to come.  I admire Ms. Bardot of France for speaking the plain and simple truth about what the Muslims are doing to France.  I admire her even more for having the courage to continue speaking out against what has been allowed by her government, and her willingness to continue to pay for her &ldquo;transgressions&rdquo;.  As for our side of the pond, Americans have flooded the phone lines to Congress whenever amnesty comes up for debate, and have overwhelming opposed it.  You talk to your average, thinking American and they&rsquo;ll wonder why our government hasn&rsquo;t done more to stop the flow across our borders because they&rsquo;d love to see a plan implemented.  Most of us realize that we cannot continue to allow masses of poor and uneducated people to stream into our country.  Yet, our officials have allowed this to occur all under the guise of fairness and diversity, perhaps white guilt&hellip;and cheap labor. God help us. </p>
