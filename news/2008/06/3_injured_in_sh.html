						<p>Three people are injured after shots were fired during the Juneteenth festival in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police are still investigating. They say it appears to be gang related.</p>
<p>Two of the injuries took place at the WCCO Radio promotional booth. A radio promotions employee was hit in his ankle, and a woman from U.S. Bank was shot in the thigh.</p>
<p>Juneteenth celebrates the freeing of African-American slaves. A member of the Juneteenth board of directors says the event is supposed to be healing, and the shooting hurts the whole African-American community.</p>

			<p>What does anyone expect whenever blacks get together for these type of events, or when and wherever blacks live in concentrated numbers?  Violence and mayhem are ALWAYS the undercurrent and always come to the surface.  Yet if a white happens to point this out, the white is decried and persecuted as a &#8220;racist bigot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are just a few examples of blacks&rsquo; outbursts of gunfire in crowds, hastily plucked from the vast storehouse which you can browse for yourself&hellip;</p>

			<p>Anywhere blacks congregate for functions of this nature, the result is ALWAYS the same.</p>
<p>It could be a meeting of black members of mensa (all 5 of them), at the Ritz Carlton&hellip;&hellip;and someone would get shot or stabbed.</p>

<p>Poetic justice! Pandering media and corporate sponsors of this idiotic black &#8216;festivals&rsquo; suffer the predictable results of their stupidity. If I were these employees I would sue the corporate human resources and diversity departments for almost getting killed.</p>

I can&rsquo;t recall ever hearing about shootings during St. Patricks&rsquo; Day. During Juneteenth, there&rsquo;s always a shooting somewhere.</p>
<p>Maybe they should serve green beer on Juneteenth.</p>

			<p>What is new under the sun? As long as there are blacks congregating in large numbers there will be shootings. It seems they cannot stay peaceful and it is a wonder that any community would host a black event! As long as they shoot their own kind  who could have a problem with that?</p>

			<p>Every year in the city of my birth we used to have a wonderful Italian festival.  Over the years it got darker and darker, and eventually a shooting occured, which shut down the event for years.</p>
<p>Yet another example of endless black destruction.</p>

<p>Every mob of blacks is a &#8220;gang&#8221; to the MSM.  They usually use the term in a black on white mob beating, calling the black white-haters a &#8220;gang,&#8221; hoping to cover up the fact the incident is a hate crime against whites, pretending it was a black criminal element involved, aside and apart from the general black population.</p>
<p>The ploy still works for some ignorant whites, but many are beginning to wake up a bit since the Reverend Wright awakening on video.  I&rsquo;d love to see someone nationally bring out a similar video every week showing the same kind of anti-white, hate-filled rhetoric from one black or another.  There&rsquo;s enough out there to make a video every day.</p>

			<p>Years ago, my home city used to have a large and lively street fair every summer.  Used to, until the Diversity got violent.  If you want to keep your public festivals alive, schedule only classical, polka, country-western, folk, or oompah groups.  White music keeps the devils away.  </p>

			<p>Results are often similar whenever Black Family Reunion-type evevnts are held.  Intelligent taxpayers and local governments could pull their support from these events, possibly encouraging them to go away.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the criminal element will continue to find means of disrupting domestic tranquility as long as public opportunities exist, and as long as the perpetrators remain oblivious to the codes of any social contract. </p>
<p>How &#8216;bout a quasi-Constitutional suspension of the 2nd Amendment&rsquo;s right to bear arms?  Applicable only to urban blacks and only until we can clean up their out-of-control, media and drug-induced violent fantasy by which they threaten all civic engagement.  Drastic circumstances call for drastic remedies.</p>

			<p>Funny how blacks are always &#8220;healing&#8221; but SOMEHOW are never &#8216;healed&rsquo;. Jews, Ukranians and Armenians have moved on from their holocausts. Japan has moved on from atomic bombs, Germans from Dresden etc, the Cambodians from Pol Pot, but blacks are ALWAYS still in need of &#8220;healing&#8221;. I think I need &#8220;healing&#8221; because 250 years ago my Gaelic ancestors were kicked off their land and had their croft burned after Culloden. </p>

			<p>  In a previous week&rsquo;s post, I warned whites against being anywhere near Juneteeth celebrations because violence was sure to be part of the celebration.  It didn&rsquo;t take much of a Nostradamus to get that prophesy right.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Just goes to show, whether it be a rap concert or any type of street festival, you cannot have a large gathering of young blacks without an eruption of violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly. Recently here(Texas) we had the Texas Relays, where blacks from all over the state were in town competing in sports races, etc. All of these young blacks were well dressed and athletic.  That evening, they all congregated in the downtown area to party. It was totally black and they were loud, obnoxious and aggressive. The police had SWAT teams on the roof above the crowd. Despite this, there were two shootings. When all whites gather at the same place for some music festival or something, you have a few drunken fist fights but no shootings. When its&rsquo; all hispanic, you have some drunken fights and a stabbing but no shootings. When asians have some festival, there are no shootings. With blacks, there is always a shooting or violence. Last Juneteenth here, a Mexican national, who was a passenger in a car that accidentally bumped a little black girl who ran into the street(no injuries or anything) was beaten to death by an angry mob. The news media here worked hard to downplay it saying it had nothing to do with Juneteenth blah blah. However, in Mexico, the headlines screamed &#8220;Mexican lynched by blacks&#8221;. I thought that was funny.</p>

			<p>In Toronto, Canada, they have a Carribana celebration, where Blacks from all over the city get together for this very colorful celebration, with parades and tables set-up for those interested in trying food from the Carribean. Many Whites also attend these festivities; Toronto is, afterall, a multicultural city. Every year, at Carribana, there are shootings and stabbings, as many of the young Blacks are gang members representing their neighborhoods. It never fails&hellip;</p>

<p>I worked as a valet downtown during the Texas Relays, in my younger years, and will attest to the fact that not one person working in the downtown area gets excited around that time of year.</p>
<p>A waitress I dated at a great Cajun eatery downtown told me of black &#8220;youth&#8221; that was leaning so far back in his chair that he fell backwards.  He then demanded to have his parties&rsquo; meal comped.  When this didn&rsquo;t happen, they left her a $1.50(in change) tip on about a $200 tab.  Typical.  Funny thing was she was a liberal and couldn&rsquo;t bear to admit that his race had something to do with it.  Typical also.</p>

			<p>meanwhile, the people in charge are focusing on Don Imus&rsquo;s comment about the normal behavior of black athletes. Yet this is about as normal and unexceptional as they come. Yet, if I commented about this in public, I would be branded as a racist even though everyone else listening agreed.</p>

			<p>Similiar to Black bike week, when Myrtle Beach SC gets trashed on an anmual basis. Loud rap music, and mountains of litter when it is all done. The worst eye-sore is being stuck in traffic as this is going on, their women will be on the back of the bikes w dressed in bikini&rsquo;s with thongs, and will stick out, and bounce their large backsides, for commuters caught in traffic. A lewd display they force locals and their kids to witness, when they are just trying to get safely to their destination.</p>

			<p>Reverend Farakhans(?) proposal to fence off some part of North America for all blacks to migrate into still looks good. As an added bonus, they could bring all their hip-hop noise and their guns. Occasionally, the rest of America could hold a telethon to ship them ammunition.</p>

<p>You mean Catholic Charities and Minnesota&rsquo;s elected officials right? Because I have nothing to do with sanctioning this event as a Minnesotan. Only our trusted officials allow this event to take place, and will continue to, even though WCCO Radio and US Bank employees were shot at this year- and another died from gunfire in &#8216;06.</p>

			<p>If this shooting was, as the MSM wants to pretend &#8220;gang-related&#8221;, why were some radio station employees at a radio station promotional booth shot?  Are radio station employees now &#8220;gang-members&#8221;?  The only disc jockey I&rsquo;ve known personally was a middle-aged white guy.  He doesn&rsquo;t seem the type.</p>
<p>You need healing less than you think, 12:18 AM.  While the Highland Clearances were brutal, they achieved one very beneficial effect for the locals, in that they reduced the population of Scotland.  Scotland was overpopulated before 1747, and every bit as dependant on the potato as Ireland was.  The Clearances thus prevented a later potato famine in Scotland.  Besides, I&rsquo;ve lived there.  It&rsquo;s cold, damp and rainy.  Edinburgh is as far north as Moscow.</p>

			<p>I live next to a very large public sports arena.  There are games of all sorts taking place constantly and never any concerns. Last week there were a large number of black people participating in track and field and the amount of litter they left was digusting.  Meanwhile of course, you can&rsquo;t take two steps without walking past a garbage or recycling bin.  They either have no respect whatsoever or just don&rsquo;t feel like mustering up the energy to walk two steps to a bin or most probably both.  While litter is the least of my concern, as I am thankful they never shot any of us, it still just goes to show you.   </p>

			<p>I live in Sacramento and during the state fair they used to have what was called the &#8220;black heritage weekend&#8221; to close the fair.  They had so many violent melees and crime around and inside the fair that on the black heritage weekend they close the fair three hours earlier and don&rsquo;t allow anyone in after 5 pm.  This is just par for the course.</p>

<p>This my friends is one of the main reasons the &#8220;Old South&#8221; had segregation. It was never due to &#8220;skin color&#8221; but the behavior that came along with this &#8220;skin color&#8221;. The South had lived closely side by side around large numbers of blacks for generations and knew what they were like up close and personal  On an individual basis, blacks could and can be intelligent and decent people but in large numbers,they are a nightmare. Southerners segregated themselves and blacks to be protected from black&rsquo;s bad behavior and kept a hard line with blacks because if they didn&rsquo;t, crime would have been out of control and whites couldn&rsquo;t have lived safely. Of course that was in a different era. Today, black inner cities in the South and elsewhere have tons of violence and whites in the South same as elsewhere have long since fled for the burbs.</p>

<p>This is such typical black behavior. Having worked as a waitress back in school, blacks would usually stiff you. These blacks would spend loads of money on expensive meals and run you ragged, then leave little or no tip.   They were also always trying to get something for nothing by complaining. If I were a waitress now, I would spend the minimum amount of time on blacks,just enough to do the job and give my main attention to the paying customers.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This subject reminds me of the 2001 Mardi Gras here in Seattle and just how quickly they tried to tell people it had &ldquo;nothing to do with race&rdquo;. I still get sick everytime I remember it. I&rsquo;m sure that some of you reading remember it too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty,<br>
I remember the Mardi Gras celebrations on Philadelphia&rsquo;s South Street. They ran for a few years and then were cancelled or severly scaled down due to violence. There were some Whites who had overindulged in alcohol but video footage of the real violence showed only groups of Blacks assaulting groups of Whites; no the other way around.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Juneteenth is like all the street signs for any &ldquo;DR MARTIN LUTHER KING BLVD&rdquo;&hellip;&hellip;translation:&hellip;&hellip;.Whites stay away if you want to live.&#8221;<br>
- Whenever me and my wife go out of town, we always do a Mapquest from our hotel to the local MLK Blvd. If it&rsquo;s more than 5 miles, we feel safer. That may be the best part about every ghetto having a street with that name; you know where to stay the hell away from. </p>

<p>&#8220;You mean Catholic Charities and Minnesota&rsquo;s elected officials right? Because I have nothing to do with sanctioning this event as a Minnesotan. Only our trusted officials allow this event to take place, and will continue to, even though WCCO Radio and US Bank employees were shot at this year- and another died from gunfire in &lsquo;06.&#8221;</p>

<p>&gt; Thanks for your added info.  I actually made the comment in a moment of sheer peek at my lifelong experience with the over-whelmingly liberal Old Northwest.  You may not have voted for the politicians who continually do these sorts of things, but the majority does.  These are the typical Scandinavian, Lutheran raised liberals whose daughters often supply the black pimps in NYC with sex fodder.  No capitulation seems too outlandish as long as they are sacrificing themselves to some vague principal of utopian multiculturalism.  As a former Lutheran myself, I see the connection.  Even Garrison Keeler in his famous &#8220;Prarie Home Companion&#8221; radio show both pokes fun at it and promotes it at the same time.  On the other hand, I am sure that there is much more to it than that.  I really hople that our white population in the &#8220;Old Northwest&#8221; will become more conservative - at least locally.</p>

<p>Boy, is that the truth, my cousin used to waitress in a very um how shall I say it? (diverse part of town) Blacks were frequent customers. And some of the stories she told were unbelievable, but she wasn&rsquo;t making it up. She said some would eat almost all of their meal, then complain about food sickness, hoping to get a free meal out of them. Other times, dead insects would mysteriously be found on their plates after a meal was almost completely consumed. And this was a restaurant which was graded A+ for kitchen cleanliness. And just as you mentioned, they would constantly bark orders at them, demand more gravy on their potatoes, more butter for their rolls, and so on. And after busting their tails for them, they would leave a meager tip in changes, or no tip at all.<br>

			<p>I delivered a lot of pizza when I was out of federal prison, and blacks just didn&rsquo;t tip, even if they had a 50-inch flatscreen TV.</p>

<p>Funny but true. One black woman claimed to have found a fried rat in her fried chicken bucket. It turns out later to be a fraud, she had fried it up herself. She was actually charged. As someone else said, if I were a waiter/waitress, I&rsquo;d give blacks what they pay for. If they barked orders at me, asked for more gravy or whatever, I&rsquo;d take my sweet time and woulnd&rsquo;t bother trying to please them or be in a hurry.  I wait on the white people first because they are mostly the ones who pay and I&rsquo;d do them last. Sure they&rsquo;d complain but no matter how hard you try to please blacks they&rsquo;ll complain anyway so why try.</p>

Then they swould complain that you were showing favoritism and they would sue the restaurant for discrimination.  You can&rsquo;t win!</p>
