						<p>Textbooks at a private Islamic school in northern Virginia teach students that it is permissible for Muslims to kill adulterers and converts from Islam, according to a federal investigation released Wednesday.</p>
<p>Other passages in the school&rsquo;s textbooks state that &#8220;the Jews conspired against Islam and its people&#8221; and that Muslims are permitted to take the lives and property of those deemed &#8220;polytheists.&#8221;</p>
<p>The passages were found in selected textbooks used during the 2007-08 school year by the Islamic Saudi Academy, which teaches 900 students in grades K-12 at two campuses in Alexandria and Fairfax and receives much of its funding from the Saudi government.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>School was recommended for closure</b></p>
<p>The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a panel formed by Congress, last year recommended that the school be closed amid concerns that it promotes violence and too closely mimics the conservative Saudi educational system.</p>
<p>The commission made its recommendation last year to close the school even though it had not reviewed the textbooks. Now that some have been reviewed, &#8220;we feel more confident that the potential problems we flagged before really are there,&#8221; said the commission&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Judith Ingram.</p>
<p>School officials have long denied that the academy fosters intolerance. It has acknowledged that some of the Saudi textbooks contain harsh language, but says that the texts have improved in recent years and are revised as needed by the academy before being distributed to students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* The authors of a 12th-grade text on Quranic interpretation state that apostates (those who convert from Islam), adulterers and people who murder Muslims can be permissibly killed.</p>
<p>* The authors of a 12th-grade text on monotheism write that &#8220;(m)ajor polytheism makes blood and wealth permissible,&#8221; meaning that a Muslim can take with impunity the life and property of someone believed guilty of polytheism. According to the panel, the strict Saudi interpretation of polytheism includes Shiite and Sufi Muslims as well as Christians, Jews, Hindus and Buddhists.</p>
<p>* A social studies text offers the view that Jews were responsible for the split between Sunni and Shiite Muslims: &#8220;The cause of the discord: The Jews conspired against Islam and its people. A sly, wicked person who sinfully and deceitfully professed Islam infiltrated (the Muslims).&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hyland [Supervisor Gerald Hyland] and the county never released results of what they had found, but Hyland said in approving the lease that he is comfortable with the school&rsquo;s teachings, though he did so with a qualification.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be less than frank if I didn&rsquo;t tell you that the curriculum does contain references to the Quran, which, if taken out of context and read literally, would cause come concern,&#8221; Hyland said at the meeting at which the lease was extended.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if they don&rsquo;t have such schools in Canada as well.  I mean, wouldn&rsquo;t that count as &#8220;hate speech&#8221;?  Same for parts of Europe.  I&rsquo;m also wondering if closing the school is enough.  Isn&rsquo;t incitement to violence a crime?</p>
<p>These questions, coming from me, should be taken seriously by radical Muslims.  You see, I&rsquo;m a Jew.  We created discord among Muslims once - with the Sunna and Shia&rsquo; - and (if they don&rsquo;t behave themselves) we can do it again.  So watch out or we&rsquo;ll create a gay Muslim sect and guess who they&rsquo;ll have waiting for them in heaven (instead of the 70 virgins) after they blow themselves up.</p>

			<p>Obama better watch his back.  Despite his claims to the contrary, he was raised as a Muslim up to about age 10.  So under Islamic law, he can be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam" rel="nofollow">murdered as an apostate</a>.</p>
<p>I am disturbed by the teachings of this school, of course, but I am equally disturbed that the state thinks it has the authority to shut down a private school.  The best way to resolve this conflict would be to not have allowed these extremists to immigrate into our country in the first place.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;if taken out of context and read literally&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Has &#8220;taken out of context&#8221; become the latest lie used to excuse spiteful remarks by crazies like Reverand Wright?  Exactly in what context are we supposed to take the repeated advocacy of the murder of innocent strangers?</p>
<p>These schools appear to be leasing public buildings from the county government.  Would Supervisor Hyland have been in as big a hurry to renew their lease and make excuses for them if the textbooks in question advocated the dumping of bags full of kittens on highways instead of the murders of human beings?</p>

			<p>I have been saying all along that the Saudis are our biggest problem here in the U.S. their school, their Wahabii faith are all anathema to our way of life. If these soon to be terrorists are allowed to remain in the U.S. it will be to complete their terror field training. Not only should this school be closed down, all mosques in the state should be destroyed, ALL of the students sent to Saudi (after being fingerprinted, IRIS printed and photographed) and then EVERY OTHER SAUDI in the U.S.deported. Also send Mr Gerald Hyland to Saudi too. I have more respect for the Iraqis, I am in Iraq, than any Saudi or Kuwaiti.</p>

			<p>Nothing will be done about the instructions to murder because they belong to a specially-privileged minority which can do no wrong, and which can accuse anyone else of &#8220;hate&#8221; but never be accused of hate.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m disturbed that the media is surprised at this. With all the information available to us in the modern age, you&rsquo;d think people would become less ignorant, not more. But unfortunately, most people are brainwashed and indoctrinated from birth to ignore reality and to stick to what their teachers and the media tells them, despite the massive mountain of evidence showing that Islam is clearly a violent religion, and not just &#8220;hijacked by radicals&#8221;.</p>

			<p>They can close this school down and many more like it, but it isn&rsquo;t going to halt this same kind of hateful Muslim teachings from being passed on elsewhere.  </p>
<p>The self-appointed elites reveal just how dense they really are by pushing for a secular-progressive society, condemning and hating Christianity in the process, then importing religious fanatics that are in direct opposition to everything they stand for, and they do so with a fervor that puts leftist radicalism to shame by comparison.</p>
<p>How ironic it would be if these same multicults were forced to live under sharia law.  It would be a much deserved punishment for them and would amount to a fate worse than death.</p>

			<p>Thanks to a corrupt Church and weakened Christian morals these people will be the antidote to the rampant feminism and the homosexual agenda in our society.  </p>
