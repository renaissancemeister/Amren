<h1><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/memphis-crime">American Murder Mystery</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hanna Rosin, Atlantic Monthly, July/August 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On September 27, 2007, a headline in The Commercial Appeal, the city&rsquo;s biggest newspaper, announced a dubious honor: &ldquo;Memphis Leads U.S. in Violent Crime.&rdquo; Local precincts had been seeing their internal numbers for homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery tick up since the late 1990s, starting around the time Barnes saw the first dead car. By 2005, a criminologist closely tracking those numbers was describing the pattern as a crime explosion. In May of 2007, a woman from upscale Chickasaw Gardens was raped by two men, at gunpoint; the assailants had followed her and her son home one afternoon. Outraged residents formed Citizens Against Crime and lobbied the statehouse for tougher gun laws. &ldquo;People are concerned for their lives, frankly,&rdquo; said one county commissioner, summarizing the city&rsquo;s mood. This March, a man murdered six people, including two young children, in a house a few miles south of Old Allen Station. </p>
<p>Falling crime rates have been one of the great American success stories of the past 15 years. New York and Los Angeles, once the twin capitals of violent crime, have calmed down significantly, as have most other big cities. Criminologists still debate why: the crack war petered out, new policing tactics worked, the economy improved for a long spell. Whatever the alchemy, crime in New York, for instance, is now so low that local prison guards are worried about unemployment. </p>
<p>Lately, though, a new and unexpected pattern has emerged, taking criminologists by surprise. While crime rates in large cities stayed flat, homicide rates in many midsize cities (with populations of between 500,000 and 1 million) began increasing, sometimes by as much as 20percent a year. In 2006, the Police Executive Research Forum, a national police group surveying cities from coast to coast, concluded in a report called &ldquo;A Gathering Storm&rdquo; that this might represent &ldquo;the front end &hellip; of an epidemic of violence not seen for years.&rdquo; The leaders of the group, which is made up of police chiefs and sheriffs, theorized about what might be spurring the latest crime wave: the spread of gangs, the masses of offenders coming out of prison, methamphetamines. But mostly they puzzled over the bleak new landscape. According to FBI data, America&rsquo;s most dangerous spots are now places where Martin Scorsese would never think of staging a shoot-out &mdash; Florence, South Carolina; Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Reading, Pennsylvania; Orlando, Florida; Memphis, Tennessee. </p>
<p>Memphis has always been associated with some amount of violence. But why has Elvis&rsquo;s hometown turned into America&rsquo;s new South Bronx? Barnes thinks he knows one big part of the answer, as does the city&rsquo;s chief of police. A handful of local criminologists and social scientists think they can explain it, too. But it&rsquo;s a dismal answer, one that city leaders have made clear they don&rsquo;t want to hear. It&rsquo;s an answer that offers up racial stereotypes to fearful whites in a city trying to move beyond racial tensions. Ultimately, it reaches beyond crime and implicates one of the most ambitious antipoverty programs of recent decades. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When his map was complete, a clear if strangely shaped pattern emerged: Wait a minute, he recalled thinking. I see this bunny rabbit coming up. People are going to accuse me of being on shrooms! The inner city, where crime used to be concentrated, was now clean. But everywhere else looked much worse: arrests had skyrocketed along two corridors north and west of the central city (the bunny rabbit&rsquo;s ears) and along one in the southeast (the tail). Hot spots had proliferated since the mid-1990s, and little islands of crime had sprung up where none had existed before, dotting the map all around the city. </p>
<p>Janikowski might not have managed to pinpoint the cause of this pattern if he hadn&rsquo;t been married to Phyllis Betts, a housing expert at the University of Memphis. Betts and Janikowski have two dogs, three cats, and no kids; they both tend to bring their work home with them. Betts had been evaluating the impact of one of the city government&rsquo;s most ambitious initiatives: the demolition of the city&rsquo;s public-housing projects, as part of a nationwide experiment to free the poor from the destructive effects of concentrated poverty. Memphis demolished its first project in 1997. The city gave former residents federal &ldquo;Section8&rdquo; rent-subsidy vouchers and encouraged them to move out to new neighborhoods. Two more waves of demolition followed over the next nine years, dispersing tens of thousands of poor people into the wider metro community. </p>
