<h1>American TV Not Crazy, Just Japanese</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A grown man wearing a diaper is spun around until he can barely stand, then is made to try an obstacle course carrying pitchers of milk without spilling any.</p>
<p>Another man, dressed like an insect, flings himself onto a giant-sized &#8220;windshield&#8221; with a giant-sized &#8220;splat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is American television going crazy? No &mdash; American television is going Japanese.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Tuesday, ABC is airing back-to-back premieres of &#8220;Wipeout&#8221; (8 p.m EDT) and &#8220;I Survived a Japanese Game Show&#8221; (9 p.m. EDT), with a domestic edition of &#8220;Hole in the Wall&#8221; coming this fall on Fox.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s going to be like nothing that American audiences have ever seen on network television,&#8221; says &#8220;I Survived&#8221; host Tony Sano.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a great desire to shock over there,&#8221; notes &#8220;Hole in the Wall&#8221; executive producer Stuart Krasnow. &#8220;Ironically, we&rsquo;re more puritan over here. But the Japanese will shock to any extreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>Popular around the world, &#8220;Hole&#8221; pits contestants against solid walls coming at them with odd-shaped openings. They must mimic those shapes with their bodies to allow them to pass through the walls, lest they get knocked into a pool of water.</p>
<p>Physically challenging, for sure. But for sheer zaniness, &#8220;I Survived&#8221; executive producers Arthur Smith and Kent Weed have gone all-out weird.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By now, you&rsquo;re probably picking up that the most consistent themes in Japanese game shows are humiliation and embarrassment &mdash; sometimes to the point of sadistic &mdash; which oddly enough can serve as stress relief for conservative Japanese. &#8220;It&rsquo;s one of the only avenues they have for release, where they can actually let go and not be conservative anymore,&#8221; notes Weed.</p>
<p>Krasnow agrees. While U.S. game show contestants are in it for the cash and prizes, he says the motivation is far different for the Japanese player.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To make it through such torture also reflects well on one&rsquo;s family, Smith says of the Japanese. &#8220;Their games are all about saving face. When you don&rsquo;t do good, you&rsquo;ve harmed your family &mdash; you don&rsquo;t look good in your family&rsquo;s eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this is very different from American game shows, where players are generally treated with respect, no matter how goofily they behave.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And unlike Japan, U.S. game show contestants are typically chosen for their likeability. &#8220;We place a lot of emphasis on casting,&#8221; says David Goldberg, president of Endemol Entertainment, which produces &#8220;Deal or No Deal&#8221; and the upcoming &#8220;Wipeout.&#8221; &#8220;We think it&rsquo;s really important to have people playing the game that we relate to and have a genuine interest in seeing them win.&#8221;</p>
