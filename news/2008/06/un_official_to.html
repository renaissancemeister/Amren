						<p>The United Nations plans to examine Prince William County&rsquo;s aggressive crackdown on illegal immigrants during a visit next week. </p>
<p>Jorge Bustamante, the United Nation&rsquo;s special rapporteur on migrants&rsquo; rights, plans to tour Manassas and Woodbridge, receive briefings on local enforcement measures, and attempt to meet with local officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Mexican native and Notre Dame University sociology professor, Bustamante has reviewed treatment of migrants in Guatemala and Mexico and toured the United States during a three-week review of American immigration policies last year.</p>
<p>County Chairman Corey Stewart said he is willing to meet with Bustamante, but sharply rebuked the international body for what he called an anti-American agenda.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hundreds of legal and illegal immigrants have moved out of the county to avoid the policy, leading to a drop of more than 750 students in the county&rsquo;s public school programs for English-language learners.</p>
<p>Prince William County&rsquo;s measures deserve more scrutiny, said Kent Willis, executive director of the Virginia American Civil Liberties Union. &ldquo;It is serving as a model of what not to do when it comes to addressing immigrant issues at a local level,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But the United Nations should not have a role, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. &ldquo;Our immigration policy is not a subject for the U.N. or any foreign institution, pure and simple.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>This is an act of assymetrical warfare. </p>
<p>Whenever the UN (or any <span class="caps">NGO</span>) gets involved in <span class="caps">OUR </span>affairs it is best to view them not as &#8220;impartial&#8221; humantiarians but as (soft) mercenaries.</p>
<p>They have a strategy, a goal, a sponsor (&#8220;our&#8221; government) and an enemy: <span class="caps">US.</span></p>

					<p><span class="caps">OK,</span> Bustamante. Honestly compare and contrast <span class="caps">PWC </span>with any other nation. </p>
<p>&#8220;County Chairman Corey Stewart said he is willing to meet with Bustamante, but sharply rebuked the international body for what he called an anti-American agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>That agenda is a given, and Stewart shouldn&rsquo;t be expected to provide the UN rep with so much as the time of day. Personally, I would prefer John Bolton be appointed as &#8216;tour guide&rsquo;. No doubt the conclusions that will follow Bustamantes&rsquo;s &#8216;examination&rsquo; have already been determined.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the United Nations should not have a role, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. &ldquo;Our immigration policy is not a subject for the <span class="caps">U.N. </span>or any foreign institution, pure and simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nail&hellip;head. Afterwards, there will be no pat on the back, no compliments for the extraordinary attention given by the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>to the &#8216;rights&rsquo; of illegal aliens. And definitely &#8216;no comment&rsquo; regarding the damages done by the illegal aliens themselves after violating our borders. It will be a blanket condemnation of our policy. </p>

What in heavens name are &#8216;migrants rights&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Is that the right to move anywhere at anytime and do anything without criticism?</p>
<p>The UN should be investigating Mexico and their actions against South Americans. They won&rsquo;t because 1) there&rsquo;s no money in it and 2) Mexico can&rsquo;t be kowtowed into submission like the US can.</p>

					<p>All I can say is that his conclusion will be the same even if he didn&rsquo;t go and &#8220;investigate&#8221;. He would still blame those racist White Americans for being cruel to those poor, innocent, <i>undocumented</i> Mexicans.</p>
<p>But silly me, to the Mexicans (and their enablers on both sides of the political spectrum), racist and White American are one and the same.</p>

					<p>I trust that the Prince William officials that were gutsy enough to enact this laws with politely show any UN official the door when they come inquiring about our policies.</p>

					<p>The UN needs to keep their noses out of the illegal immigramt issue. These immigrants are here illegally and that is an affront and crime against the legitimate citizens of the United States. In fact the UN in my opinion only exists by the grace of the United States, Canada and Western European Nations since the afore bear the lions share of the <span class="caps">UN&rsquo;</span>s expenses. </p>

					<p>So much for the sovereign Commonwealth of Virgina.  How could a Mexican&rsquo;t native possibly know what is good for a county in Virginia? PW County did what it had to do to keep from its resources from being entirely suck up by &#8220;immgrants.&#8221; Is the UN going to foot the bill now?</p>

					<p>If these UN officials possess diplomatic passports, meddlers like this one should simply be expelled from the US for conduct unbecoming their diplomatic status.  It wouldn&rsquo;t take very many before the rest got the message.</p>

					<p>The saddest thing I find in this whole illegal immigration travesty is that a superpower has not bowed to a mighty armada, a magnificient army or a powerful adversary of any kind. Instead, our government as surrendered to a third world corrupt and violent country who simply walked in and colonized. Thank you, Washington, for the destruction of our nation.</p>

					<p>We need to get out of the UN now. We also need to break this country up into a white homeland, a black home land and give Calification to Mexico. Let the Mexicans pay for all their stupid marxist social programs.</p>
