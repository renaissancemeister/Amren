<p>Local Atlanta race hustlers for the Black Leadership Forum sent out a mass e-mail urging blacks to vote their race and stating &#8220;the WHITE candidate running for mayor this year must be defeated.&#8221;</p>
<p>The authors of the memo/e-mail are William Boone and Keith Jennings, political science professors at Clark Atlanta University(A black college). It calls Mulatto candidate Lisa Borders &#8220;the best BLACK candidate.&#8221; It also says Borders is most likely to attract &#8220;downtown white support,&#8221; code for idiot white liberals who condescend black race hustlers. </p>
<p>The Black Leadership Forum was founded in 1977 by Joseph Lowery, a famous race hustler and agitator who also helped found the SCLC. The current leader is Gary Flowers, former vice president of Jesse Jackson&#8217;s Rainbow Coalition.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>CofCC.org News Team</p>
<p>Three Mexicans, two females and one male, screamed racial insults at  some white ladies in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Then they rammed Lilian Verdonkschot with their car, killing her. The victims had asked Burger King employees to call police before the murder, and the employees refused (probably Mexicans themselves).</p>
<p>The driver was Nadine Montoya. The green Cadillac she was driving reportedly was used two weeks earlier in an attempt to hit another woman.</p>
<p>Montoya has been indicted for five felonies. However, her two accomplices have yet to be charged with anything. What&#8217;s more, the DA office re-wrote the night&#8217;s event to censor the racial nature of the incident.</p>
<p>The DA&#8217;s office seems set to let two accomplices to a brutal murder (and possibly a second attempted murder) walk, and sweep the whole thing under the rug. <a href="http://www.westword.com/2009-08-27/news/after-lilian-verdonskschot-died-nadine-montoya-was-been-charged-with-a-hit-and-run-but-was-hate-behind-the-wheel/1">Read More in Denver Westword News.</a></p>
<p>Friends and family of the victim want all three charged with Colorado&#8217;s &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; law. Nation-wide both state and Federal hate crimes laws are almost never applied when the victim is white.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, of all interracial crimes involving blacks and persons white or Hispanic, 84% had a white victim and a black perpetrator. Only 16% had a black victim and white perpetrator. However, the FBI has no Hispanic/Latino perpetrator category, only a Hispanic victim category.</p>
<p>All Hispanic perpetrators are counted as white, but Hispanic victims are counted as Hispanic. So this data really means that 16% of black/white interracial crimes where the victim is black, the perpetrator was either white or Hispanic. Whites are astronomically more likely to be the victim in an interracial crime. However, only 13% of the people prosecuted for Federal hate crimes charges were a non-white who attacked a white victim.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>CofCC.org News Team</p>
<p>Two thugs have been killed in self defense in the last week in Charlotte. A burglar and a mugger. Both had a long list of previous run ins with the law.</p>
<p>Notice the multitude of comments on the Charlotte Observer website. The public is sick of these thugs and are cheering the use of firearms in self defense.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/breaking/story/913596.html">Read Article.</a></p>
<p>The Charlotte Observer is having a pity party for 15 year old thug Marcus Flucker, nicknamed Looney. Flucker along with three friends broke into the home of an elderly couple, tied them and ransacked the house. 76 year C.L. McClure managed to free himself as the thugs were making away with their loot. Marcus Flucker was shot dead in the street.</p>
<p>Friends of the thug Marcus Flucker put up an online memorial for him. It&#8217;s titled &#8220;RIP Looney A Real East Side Nigga.&#8221; The site includes pictures of &#8220;Looney&#8221; with his pants around his knees and giving gang signs.</p>
<p>Readers of the Charlotte Observer aren&#8217;t buying into their &#8220;feel sorry for the thug&#8221; attitude. Here is what some had to say.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah and by the time the police got there the criminals would have been gone and not one person would have come forward to tell what they saw. If you break into someones home you should be able to shoot to kill. His mother said he was with the wrong crowd. Why didn&#8217;t she know who her kid was hanging&#8230;</p>
<p>Really i think the guy had every right to do what he did. we keep letting punks get away with this stuff and really what are the police going to do take them home to mommy. Love the fact that the mother says her son was a quote a good kid umm ok then why was he robbing the elderly or anyone for that matter.</p>
<p>WCNC News said tonight that Mr. Flucker did indeed have a lengthy history of run-ins with the law. So you can pretty much forget the thought that this was an aberration with an otherwise good kid. He was on his way to becoming a career criminal.</p>
<p>The world is better off without him. It would be a better place without his buddies too. Just give it some time. They&#8217;ll be in the news again&#8230; probably over and over again until somebody stops them as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are dozens more, just like these. <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/topstories/story/905371.html?storylink=kibboko">Click Here.</a></p>

				<h3><a href="http://cofcc.org/?p=6475" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Czech President: Europe threatened by Socialism, loss of freedoms.">Czech President: Europe threatened by Socialism, loss of freedoms.</a></h3>

				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><img class="alignright" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9nTItnS3VNk/SD2Ojv0CvwI/AAAAAAAAVLs/crSfKDHDDSo/s400/czech+president+Klaus.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="224"/>From Brussels Journal, Speech by Czech President Vaclav Klaus</p>
<p>The title of my speech then was “Post-Communist Era: Atmosphere of Victory or of Lost Illusions?” We had a mixed feeling at that time. We had quite rapidly liquidated the formal structures and mechanisms of the communist society and successfully established parliamentary democracy and market economy. The question was whether we were building free society based on classical liberal principles or whether we – instead – had fallen into another blind alley of regulated society, of unproductive welfare state, of brave new world of European socialdemocratism and of empty and artificial Europeanism. My answer to that question was that the winner of the transition decade was democracy, not freedom or classical liberalism. Our original slogan: “deregulate, liberalize, privatize” was gradually transformed into a different one: “regulate, adjust to all kinds of standards of the most developed and richest countries, listen to the partial interests of the NGOs and follow them, get rid of your sovereignty and put it into the hands of international institutions and organizations.”</p>
<p>This year we celebrate already the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism and we are again in a reassessment mood. The situation has not changed for the better.</p>
<p>My second visit here was in August 2006. The title of my presentation was “What is Europeism (or What Should not be the Future for Europe)?” (CEP, Center for Economics and Politics, Prague, 2006) Europeism is – for me – an inconsistent, evidently heterogeneous, but in principle neosocialist doctrine, which characterizes the current thinking in Europe. It believes neither in freedom, nor in spontaneous evolution of human society. It is a “conglomerate of ideas” that includes</p>
<p>- economic (or social) views based on the concept of the so called social market economy (which is the opposite of the market economy);</p>
<p>- views on freedom, democracy and society based on collectivism, social partnership and corporatism, not on classical parliamentary democracy;</p>
<p>- views on European integration, which favor unification and supranationalism;</p>
<p>- views on foreign policy and international relations based on internationalism, cosmopolitism, abstract universalism, multiculturalism and on denationalization.</p>
<p>To my great regret, I am afraid the same speech should be repeated today. Europe is more and more dominated by this way of thinking despite the fact that it is an extremely naïve, unpractical and romantic utopism, not shared by European silent majority, but predominantly by European elites.</p>
<p>Looking back, I am slightly surprised that in 2006 I did not mention environmentalism and global warming alarmism as a new threat to our freedom and prosperity. My book “Blue Planet in Green Shackles” – after its Czech, English, German, Dutch, Russian, Polish, Spanish, Bulgarian and Italian editions – has since May also its French version with the title “Planète bleue en peril vert.” I would like to thank all those who helped to make this publication possible, most of all Professor Jacques Garello.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/4070">Read Entire Speech Here.</a></p>
<p>Václav Klaus is the second President of the Czech Republic (since 2003, reelected 2008) and a former Prime Minister of the Czech Republic (1992–1997). An economist by trade, he is co-founder of the Civic Democratic Party(ODS). ODS controls 9 of Czech Republic&#8217;s 22 seats in the EU, with one seat each held by two other conservative parties and eleven seats held by Communist and Socialist parties. ODS controls 41% of the Czech chamber of deputies and is the leader of the ruling coalition of Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Famous quotes by Vaclav Klaus</p>
<p>&#8220;The excessive openness of the West to immigrants from other cultural environments facilitates attacks by radical Islamists in western countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism is a tragic mistake of western civilization for which all will pay dearly.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Multiculturalism is an ideology that says that you should emigrate and to make claim to your civilisation, your group and ethnic interests in the new countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Global warming is a myth and I think that every serious person and scientist says so. It is unfair to refer to the United Nations panel. IPCC is not a scientific body: it&#8217;s a political institution, a kind of non-government organization with green flavor. It&#8217;s not a forum of neutral scientists or a balanced group of scientists. Its members are politicized scientists who arrive there with one-sided sentiments and one-sided tasks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Environmentalism as a meta-physical ideology and as a world view has absolutely nothing to do with natural sciences or the climate itself. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with social sciences either. Despite these facts, it is getting fashionable and this process scares me.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Klaus has challenged Al Gore to an international debate on Global Warming.</strong></p>

<p>Ted Kennedy should have been doing hard time in prison, not ruining America in the US Senate.<br/>

The Legacy of Ted Kennedy</a></p>
<blockquote><p>A mere mortal probably would have been charged under Massachusetts law with manslaughter, perjury, or driving to endanger &#8212; or all of those offenses &#8212; and probably would have been convicted and spent time in prison. Because he was a Kennedy, the last surviving of the most noble of the clan, he received special treatment.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court got involved in the handling of his case, ordering that the inquest be closed to the public. The judge at the inquest found probable cause that Kennedy had committed a crime and could have issued a warrant for his arrest but didn&#8217;t. The district attorney declined to prosecute him for manslaughter. A grand jury, which was not permitted to see relevant evidence including the inquest judge&#8217;s findings, did not issue an indictment.</p>
<p>The family of the victim had been paid off and didn&#8217;t pursue legal action. There was no autopsy, but when it was found that there had been blood in her mouth and on her clothes, which was inconsistent with the initial finding of accidental drowning, the family blocked the authorities from exhuming her body to perform an autopsy.</p>
<p>Kennedy pled guilty to one charge of leaving the scene of an accident after causing injury. After his lawyer and the prosecutor agreed that Kennedy should receive probation because of his age, character, and prior reputation, the judge sentenced him to the mandatory two-months incarceration and suspended the sentence. </p></blockquote>

<p>The NAACP, the Black Clergy of Philadelphia, and other black agitation groups are planning a massive rally IN SUPPORT of felon dog fighting organizer Micheal Vick.</p>
<p>Once again the NAACP is holding a rally to support a thug. It should be called the National Association For the Advancement of Criminal Persons. The NAACP also supported Vick before and during the trial and</p>
<p>Even left-wing whites are shocked by this action.</p>
