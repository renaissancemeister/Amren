				New Century Foundation to Release Interracial Crime Report

				<p>
					What: Study: Blacks Commit 90 Percent of Interracial Crime Report to be released at press conference
				</p>
				<p>
					When: Wednesday, June 2, 10 a.m.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where: National Press Club, 14th and F streets, N.W. <br>
					13th Floor, West Room <br>
					Washington, D.C.
				</p>
				<p>
					Details: African-Americans commit 90 percent of the approximately 1,700,000 interracial crimes of violence that occur every year in the United States, and are more than 50 times more likely to commit violent crime against whites than vice versa.
				</p>
				<p>
					Blacks are so much more likely than Americans of other races to commit crimes that police may be justified in stopping and questioning them more frequently -- just as they stop men more often than women and young people more often than old people.
				</p>
				<p>
					These are some of the controversial findings of a new think tank report based on extensive cross-analysis of government crime statistics. The report will be released at a news conference on Wednesday, June 2.
				</p>
				<p>
					The report finds that Asians consistently commit the smallest number of crimes, followed by whites, Hispanics commit violent crime at approximately three times the white rate, and blacks are five to eight times more violent.
				</p>
				<p>
					In one of its most startling conclusions, the report finds that blacks are as much more likely to commit violent crimes than whites as men are more likely to commit violent crimes than women. This leads to the widely criticized practice of "racial profiling," in which police question blacks more frequently than whites.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study also finds there is more black-on-white than black-on- black crime. When blacks commit violent crime, they target whites slightly more than half the time. When whites commit violence they target blacks 2 to 3 percent of the time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Blacks are also twice as likely as whites to commit hate crimes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jared Taylor, author of the report, is an internationally- trained economist and crime expert. He will present the report at the press conference.
				</p>
				<p>
					New Century Foundation, which sponsored the report, is a non-profit organization based in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Oakton, Va.
