			<h1>
				About Us
			</h1>
			<h2>
				What We Believe
			</h2>
			<p>
				Race is an important aspect of individual and group identity. Of all the fault lines that divide society &mdash; language, religion, class, ideology &mdash; it is the most prominent and divisive. Race and racial conflict are at the heart of some of the most serious challenges the Western World faces in the 21st century.
			</p>
			<p>
				The problems of race cannot be solved without adequate understanding. Attempts to gloss over the significance of race or even to deny its reality only make problems worse. Progress requires the study of all aspects of race, whether historical, cultural, or biological. This approach is known as race realism.

				<em>American Renaissance </em>was published as a monthly print magazine from October 1990 through January 2012. All back issues are available <a href="archives/back-issues.html">here</a>. AR has had a web presence since 1994, and we consider AmRen.com to be the Internet&rsquo;s premier race-realist site. Every weekday we publish articles and news items from a world-wide race-realist perspective.
