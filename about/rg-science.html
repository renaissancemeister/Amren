			<h2>
				Science
			</h2>
			<p>
				Race realists have a great advantage over those who push egalitarian orthodoxy: We accept what science says about race and genetics, and are eager for further discoveries. The more progress science makes the more secure our positions become.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/2005/01/index.html">What We Owe Our People</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Frank Salter, <i>On Genetic Interests: Family, Ethny and Humanity in an Age of Mass Migration</i>, Peter Lang, 2003, 388 pp., $38.95 (softcover).
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a detailed review of one of the most important books on genetics you will ever read. It explains in careful detail why racial solidarity is no different from &mdash; and just as necessary as &mdash; family solidarity. The genetic underpinnings of ethnic consciousness are as strong as those of the love of parents for their children.
			</p>
			<p>
				This book is a scientific justification for the racial consciousness all healthy people feel instinctively. It is science at its best and most relevant.
			</p>
			<h3>
				What Science Says About Diversity, <a href="/ar/2007/11/index.html">Parts I</a> and <a href="/ar/2007/12/index.html">II</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				A search of the literature on everything from plant behavior to brain function to choice of mate to social patterning shows that nature itself is ethnocentric. Humans are no different from other species: They prefer the company of their own kind. Attempts to stimulate and glorify diversity are clearly an attempt to thwart our most basic instincts. An exhaustive and eye-opening series by <a href="https://archive.jaredtaylor.org/">Jared Taylor</a>.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/1996/05/index.html">Race and Health</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				We hear over and over that blacks and Hispanics are in worse health than whites. The most common explanation is that they are denied medical care because of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and that the pressures of &ldquo;oppression&rdquo; shorten their lives. A mountain of evidence suggests otherwise: There are clear genetic differences between the races that affect health &mdash; and whites do not always fare the best.
