			<h1>
				<a href="/about/readers_guide.html">The <i>AR</i> Readers Guide</a>
			</h1>
			<h2>
				First-Person Accounts
			</h2>
			<p>
				Some of the most powerful writing in AR is by ordinary people describing their everyday experiences with non-whites. Each of these accounts &mdash; which could never be published in a mainstream publication &mdash; is a compelling story about the continuing tragedy of multi-racialism.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/1995/10/index.html">White Man in a Texas Prison</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Yes, it is as bad as you might imagine &mdash; though not always in the ways you might think.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/2006/06/index.html">Blacks and High Steel</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				An extraordinary account of what it is like to build the steel frames of skyscrapers and the camaraderie that spontaneously arises in this dangerous profession &mdash; and of the terrible damage affirmative action did to it.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/1997/01/index.html">Hell on Wheels</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				A recent immigrant from Hungary gets a job working in the New York City subway and is shocked by the anti-white venom he finds among passengers and co-workers. This is a chilling account.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/2003/09/index.html">Urban Law 101</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				An amazing and often hilarious description of what it is like to work as a divorce lawyer for blacks. The author did not start out with the intention of building a black clientele, but this was where the business led him. He has written an eye-opening description of the everyday pathologies and difficulties so many blacks face.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/2006/08/index.html">Dispatches From the Go-Slow Zone</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				A &ldquo;colorblind conservative&rdquo; accepts a job in city government and is assigned to an office that is overwhelmingly black and Hispanic. He soon becomes painfully color-conscious. Another hair-raising account that has the hard ring of authenticity.
			</p>
			<h3>
				How I Saw the Light, <a href="/ar/2003/05/index.html">Parts I</a>, <a href="/ar/2004/08/index.html">II</a>, and <a href="/ar/2005/07/index.html">III</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				How do Americans break through the blinders of contemporary orthodoxy and achieve a realistic view of race? These first-person accounts by AR readers describe the events &mdash; sometimes sharp and dramatic, sometimes slow and incremental &mdash; that changed their lives. Fascinating reading.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/2006/03/index.html">Katrina Diary</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				How did blacks in New Orleans behave after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005? The first media reports were filled with horrific barbarism, but some of these stories were later retracted. The author of this article was a cook in a New Orleans restaurant who took refuge in the New Orleans Superdome &mdash; and saw it all.
