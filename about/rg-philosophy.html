			<h2>
				The Philosophy of Race Realism
			</h2>
			<p>
				What we call race realism is what was considered traditional common sense until perhaps the 1950s. It is a body of views that was so taken for granted it had no name, but it can be summarized as follows: That race is an important aspect of individual and group identity, that different races build different societies that reflect their natures, and that it is entirely normal for whites (or for people of any other race) to want to be the majority race in their own homeland. If whites permit themselves to become a minority population, they will lose their civilization, their heritage, and even their existence as a distinct people.
			</p>
			<p>
				All other groups take it for granted that they have a right to speak out in their own interests. Only whites have lost this conviction.
			</p>
			<h4>
				<a href="/ar/1994/09/index.html">Why Race Matters</a>
			</h4>
			<p>
				The great Sam Francis describes the threats against our race and culture and explains why they must be met in specifically racial terms. This article is adapted from a speech he gave to an <i>AR</i> audience and that contributed to his being fired as staff columnist at the <i>Washington Times</i>.
			</p>
			<h4>
				<a href="/ar/1994/08/index.html">Multiculturalism and the War Against White America</a>
			</h4>
			<p>
				Lawrence Auster explains the contradictions inherent in the current myths about race, and urges whites to come to grips with the crisis they face. From a speech delivered at an American Renaissance conference.
			</p>
			<h4>
				<a href="/ar/2000/07/index.html">The War on White Heritage</a>
			</h4>
			<p>
				Sam Francis explains why attacks on the Confederate flag are simply a first, easy target of people whose real intent is an assault on whites and their culture. Northerners may have no emotional attachment to the Confederacy, but they, too, will soon find their own symbols and heritage under attack. This is Francis at his polemical best

			<h4>
				<a href="/ar/2002/11/index.html">Twelve Years of <i>American Renaissance</i></a>
			</h4>
			<p>
				Editor <a href="https://archive.jaredtaylor.org/">Jared Taylor</a> reflects on 12 years of publishing <i>American Renaissance.</i>

			<h4>
				Competitive Altruism and White Self-Destruction, <a href="/ar/2003/10/index.html">Parts I</a> and <a href="/ar/2003/11/index.html">II</a>
			</h4>
			<p>
				Ian Jobling offers a provocative theory about why whites are unable to take the most basic steps to protect themselves against dispossession.
