				Race and IQ
			</h2>
			<p>
				One of the most destructive myths of modern times is that people of all races have the same average intelligence. It is widely accepted that genes account for much of the difference in intelligence between individuals, but many people still refuse to believe genes explain group differences in average intelligence. This blindness leads to futile attempts to eliminate &ldquo;learning gaps&rdquo; between the races and forces whites to accept the view that if blacks and Hispanics are less successful than whites, it is because of white &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;

				<a href="/ar/1998/09/index.html#article1">The Definitive Word on Intelligence</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Arthur R. Jensen, <i>The g Factor,</i> Praeger Publishers, 1998, 648 pp., $39.95.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://archive.jaredtaylor.org/">Jared Taylor</a>&rsquo;s detailed review of Arthur Jensen&rsquo;s magnum opus on intelligence. In a sane world, Prof. Jensen&rsquo;s work would have earned him a Nobel Prize, and this review is the best non-technical summary of his pioneering work.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/1995/02/index.html#article2">For Whom the Bell Curves</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, <i>The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,</i> The Free Press, 1994, 845 pp. $30.00.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a detailed review of the famous book that kicked up a huge controversy about race and intelligence when it was published in 1994. It is still one of the best introductions to the genetic contribution to intelligence, and the importance of IQ for society and individuals.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/1994/12/index.html">A New Theory of Racial Differences</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				J. Philippe Rushton, <i>Race, Evolution, and Behavior,</i> Transaction Publishers, 1995, 334 pp., $34.95.
			</p>
			<p>
				Philippe Rushton brilliantly applies what is known as <i>r-K </i>theory to human racial differences. He demonstrates that races evolved separately and developed entire patterns of consistent differences. There is no better analysis.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/1997/10/index.html">Why Race Matters</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Michael Levin, <i>Why Race Matters: Race Differences and What They Mean,</i> Praeger Publishers, 1997, 415 pp., $65.00.
			</p>
			<p>
				Michael Levin brings a philosophers logic and unerring eye for cant to the question of race and intelligence.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/2006/06/index.html#article1">Why Some Races Are Smarter Than Others</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Richard Lynn, <i>Race Differences in Intelligence: An Evolutionary Analysis,</i> Washington Summit Publishers, 2006, 322 pp. $17.95 (soft cover, available in hard cover for $34.95).
			</p>
			<p>
				The other reviews in this section mainly address the evidence for a substantial genetic contribution to racial differences in average IQ. This book is an eye-opening explanation of how these differences affect life and culture around the world. It includes detailed information on virtually all groups, including Australian Aborigines and American Indians.
