				<span class="dropcap">S</span>outh Africa is headed for another racial census, a.k.a. an &ldquo;election&rdquo; on 22 April &mdash; with the predictable outcome of returning another ANC government to power. Given that South African blacks represent 80% of the population, there is absolutely no way in which the ANC could lose.
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead of dissipating over time amid the constant din of South African liberals who believe that the country has &ldquo;finally transcended race&rdquo; or is on its way to doing so, race and identity remain at the core of South African politics. No less a man than Harvard political scientist Samual Huntington once observed that South Africa was one of those countries condemned to a &ldquo;conflict of civilizations&rdquo;, with a formerly white-dominated Western country currently being Africanised by the demographically dominant black population and its Afrocentric leadership.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, I was one of the few whites attending the infamous Durban &ldquo;World Conference Against Racism&rdquo; where I actually bumped into our current caretaker president, Kgalema Motlanthe, who is keeping the seat warm for the affable Zulu named Jacob Zuma. During our conversation Motlanthe confessed to his penchant for the book that defined Afrocentrism, Martin Bernal&rsquo;s Black Athena.
			</p>
			<p>
				South Africa is today an insane society, modelled upon an Ayn Rand nightmare where the looters govern and the producers, entrepreneurs and taxpayers are constantly harassed for handing over more of their wealth. Out of a total population of 46 million people, 12 million South Africans now receive so-called government &ldquo;grants&rdquo;. They and their dependents &mdash; who amount to probably more than 20 million people or half the population &mdash; survive on these government handouts. They do not work, yet receive childcare allowances, pensions, free housing, water, electricity, healthcare and schooling.
			</p>
			<p>
				Together with the former East-Germany, South Africa must be counted among the most successful communist societies of all time where the nineteenth-century socialist dictum, &ldquo;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need,&rdquo; has become the evangelical raison d&rsquo;Ãªtre of a whole society.
			</p>
			<p>
				The so-called black middle class consists of government employees, municipal politicians and recipients of racial preference programmes going under bizarre Orwellian names such as &ldquo;BEE&rdquo;, pronounced like the name of the insect and denoting &ldquo;Black Economic Empowerment, as well as &ldquo;Equity&rdquo;, meaning precisely that blacks &ldquo;are more equal&rdquo; than whites. South African blacks enjoy a standard of living unprecendented among their brothers on the African continent. These &ldquo;black diamonds&rdquo; as they have been dubbed by advertising agencies, see themselves as a kind of aristocracy or a jetset, economically far removed from their kin living in typical and hardly disguised African squalor and legally superior to South African whites who have been reduced to second-class, exploited citizens. Many educated whites are now either unemployed or work for half the wage earned by the lowest type of black manual worker in the formal sector.
			</p>
			<p>
				On planet South Africa, where every job in a corporation or in government is subject to carefully monitored racial quotas, only an alien could believe that &ldquo;race does not matter&rdquo; and that we are sliding on our merry way to a common future as a united nation. The leader of the liberal white opposition party, Helen Zille, is such an alien, even apart from her Botox injections and heavy make-up, giving her the appearance of an ageless, emotionless android. The 58-year old liberal, who is married to a Marxist academic, has doggedly but vainly courted black support for her party, the Democratic Alliance.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, 75% of the DA&rsquo;s voters are white, and two thirds of those are Afrikaners. So at least 50% of the DA&rsquo;s vote comes from Afrikaners, yet nowhere in the party&rsquo;s statements or manifestoes is this fact ever mentioned. Its election slogan is: &ldquo;one nation, one future&rdquo;, meaning that the diverse races and cultures inhabiting South Africa should merge to form a single, integrated multicultural nation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The only party contesting the election that could remotely be considered conservative, is the Freedom Front Plus under Dr. Pieter Mulder. Officially the party is in favour of self-determination and an Afrikaner state. Yet since the party&rsquo;s formation in the early nineties, its founding principle has increasingly been pushed to the back burner. Mulder enjoys sparse support and has only four Members of Parliament, as opposed to the DA&rsquo;s fifty. For this election, Mulder has positioned himself as a &ldquo;possible coalition partner&rdquo; of the liberal DA which, of course, does not countenance the idea of Afrikaner self-determination.
