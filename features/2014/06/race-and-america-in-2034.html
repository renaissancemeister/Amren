<h1 class="title">Race and America in 2034</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">AR Staff, American Renaissance, June 20, 2014</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
Big changes or more of the same?</div> 
</div> 



<p>What will American race relations be like in 20 years? That was the question we put to a group of hard-headed commentators. The results were 10 essays that we published &mdash; one each day &mdash; from June 9 to June 20, 2014.</p>
<p>Some of the answers may surprise you, and some may provoke you, but they are exactly what you would expect from American Renaissance: thoughtful, undeceived, and free of conventional pieties.</p>
<p>Here are our authors, in the order in which they were published:</p>
<p><a href="/">John Derbyshire</a>   &mdash;   &ldquo;The Narrative&rdquo; will hold firm.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2014/06/america-in-2034-2.html">Paul Gottfried</a>   &mdash;   A real break from the leftist revolution.</p>
<p><a href="/">Gregory Hood</a>   &mdash;   To the catacombs-for now.</p>
<p><a href="/">Joseph Kay</a>   &mdash;   The triumph of the boring.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2014/06/america-in-2034-5.html">Paul Kersey</a>   &mdash;   Our flag will still fly on the moon.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2014/06/america-in-2034-6.html">Tom Kuhmann</a>   &mdash;   More of the same.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2014/06/america-in-2034-7.html">Gavin McInnes</a>   &mdash;   We are not doomed.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2014/06/america-in-2034-8.html">Fred Reed</a>   &mdash;   Hispanics could go either way.</p>
<p><a href="/">Richard Spencer</a>   &mdash;   The Howard Beale theory of history.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2014/06/america-in-2034-10.html">Jared Taylor</a>   &mdash;   Local communities are finding their own way.</p>

As a 21st century American white male, I have been trained to have complicated issues such as race and the future explained to me by super smart, uber patient darkies. Guys like neil de Grasse tyson(or whatever his name is), Barack Obama, Eric Holder; even Oprah would do in a pinch. I have learned to expect the magic negro to do the heavy thinking for me in both the print and electronic media.</p>

For me, the real issue is what Whites will do. Remember: The Soviet Union was the most powerful nation in the world in 1980; in a little over ten years it was gone. Things change. Sure, young people say they are &#8220;liberal.&#8221; But young people have hardly even begun life in the &#8220;real world.&#8221; Come on, what does anyone know at 22 or 23? Wait til they look for work; start a family; and, most important, rub elbows with blacks and browns at work commuting and on the street. That will change them. We are nearly all liberal at twenty, and more conservative by forty. A united White population of say 45% will have far more power, than a disunited one of 70%. These commentators need to remember that.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s simply not true by *any* measure. The USSR was essentially a Third World country with a strong right arm, but even in military power they always lagged behind the US. See The Myth of Soviet Military Supremacy by General Tom Gervasi.</p>

And it was good to have semi-dissenting views from McInnes and Reed just to have us look at another side of the coin from a race realist perspective. Personally, I have a very apocalyptic view of how this is going to turn out, and it is shaping some of my decisions for the future. Reading these essays helps me realize that I need to wait a few more years before gauging how things are going to turn out. A lot can happen.</p>

If we want success we need to see change happen from the bottom- up. We must organize. Just when we begin to see ourselves as a living, breathing group we must then define the direction and aims of our movement (via a manifesto, books, publications, films, etc.). </p>
<p>The mistake we&rsquo;re making (as are most right wing organizations, parties, etc.) is trying to work within the current political sphere. It&rsquo;s so broken that it is like dumping water into a broken vase. Now I have no problem with trying to become political, but alone it is futile. </p>
<p>Instead we must go with metapolitical routes:<br/>
Syndicates,<br/>
home schooling,<br/>
bleed the system of welfare,<br/>
establishing like-minded friend bases, neighborhoods,<br/>
etc.</p>

I agree 100% that Islamism is absolutely a threat that must be dealt with (mostly by use of force, though I do think peaceful deportation methods could work to some extent). What I am saying is that you cannot rely on our current Western &#8220;democratic&#8221; governments to save us. I think we have a much better chance organizing beyond the political realm (whether this be through like-minded communities, underground syndicates, organizations, etc.) and just start focusing our energy toward fostering a culture of our own (via the options above) that will unify all racially/culturally aware whites under one coherent set of ideals. That way, when a societal collapse or revolution occurs, we will essentially be independent of the government and self-sufficient while everyone else is looting, dying, starving, etc.</p>

I also assume that any such group coming to the attention of the authorities would quickly come under attack. Could be wrong, though. In this day, recall the measures al Queda had to take to avoid electronic spying from Western countries (in your scenario, the &#8216;bad guys&rsquo; will be the ones with the satellites and the pro hackers, not us). If George III had had the NSA, I&rsquo;m not sure the Sons of Liberty and the Committees of Correspondence would&rsquo;ve lived long enough to do any good.</p>

It&rsquo;s in this part that the good ol&rsquo; Americana lies. I&rsquo;m actually pretty thankful I live where I do. I wasn&rsquo;t so sheltered from urban scum that I was naive, nor was I so deep in the city that I become chronically depressed. I can&rsquo;t even walk in a Wal-Mart anymore without wanting to cut my wrists afterwards- all the fat, disease ridden, baby mommas and white trash. The countryside is beautiful, though, and so are the people.</p>
<p>I must agree, though: Suburbia, at least where I live, is either filled with old people too decrepit to fight or spoiled kids who wear such expensive Hollister clothes their parents are in debt up to their butt. It&rsquo;s examples like this that make me realize we need some big collapse in order to wake people up.</p>

Tribute to the indoctrination our public schools have pounded into kids&rsquo; minds for 60 years. Barry Goldwater wouldn&rsquo;t get 20% of the vote here today. And AuH20 is not my idea of a Rightist, at that.</p>

Whoever said &#8220;Diversity is our Strength&#8221; was lying or crazy. A lot of white dopes actually still believe in this crazy slogan. I take pride that I never bought into that baloney. That&rsquo;s because I was chased out of my neighborhood by &#8220;diversity&#8221; when I was young.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-550153" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>One symptom of societal dis-integration is a failure to reproduce. Europeans all over the world are showing this sign. Logically enough, the cure for societal dis-integration is societal re-integration (i.e., ethnic cleansing). Unfortunately, ethnic cleansing is non-PC to the max. Also, unfortunately, a dis-integrated society lacks the will to crush the PC police and facilitate ethnic cleansing. A death-spiral. Historically, this impasse is overcome by a small, dedicated, violent, group of people who brush aside the masses and make things happen. The American Revolution fit this mold (Sam Adams, Patrick Henry, Tom Paine), although with the best PR operation, by far, in history. The public can be grateful later.</p>

Once Hispanics are a dominant group, though, they will put a stop to the preferential treatment of Blacks. Whites will generally be more racial realist in 20 years, and more aware of keeping clean, safe, homogenous communities as such. I agree with Jared that such communities will be retirement meccas, with an emergence of retirement homes offering impeccable service, provided by bright, attentive, and clean cut young Whites. </p>

Hispanics will have improved, as a whole, through a combination of hard work/ambition and gaining political power. Blacks will remain at the bottom of the barrel, though much further down. And yes, no way the Hispanics will care less about their plight.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-545973" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think the best way to predict the future is to look at the past. In 1994 the US was on top of the world in every way imaginable. We had just won the cold war, the economy was booming, the middle-class was strong, etc. Since then we have suffered a terrorist attack of unimaginable destruction, entered into two costly and ultimately failed wars, our economy has been in constant recession for years on end, approximately 40% of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 9 months, race relations are worse than they have been since the 60&rsquo;s, and so on and so forth. Things have changed dramatically, we just don&rsquo;t easily recognize it. I expect that the next 20 years will bring equally dramatic changes. I don&rsquo;t know exactly what those changes will be, but I am certain that the current status quo will not survive.</p>
