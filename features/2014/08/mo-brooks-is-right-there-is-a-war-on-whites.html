Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s video&rsquo;s tell the truth and the truth is not what Hispanics and blacks want to hear. So what they do is they put a lot of pressure on YouTube by flagging the video&rsquo;s in great numbers. I&rsquo;m sure some even call YouTube. We all know that they don&rsquo;t want their dirty little secrets out for all to know. Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s video&rsquo;s are very professional and put together very well. The blacks and Hispanics are feeling the heat. I hope all the video&rsquo;s will hit 1 million views. I think everyone should pass them on to anyone they know.</p>

It is important that racially aware Whites are abreast of such things. Jared Taylor provides us with the truth. </p>

If there is no race but the human race, what right does ANYONE have to use anti-Jewish symbolism as a &#8216;teaching aid&rsquo; FOR ANYONE ELSE?<br/>
Oh, but that&rsquo;s right. Race exists when you need to use it to get ahead by punishing the innocent for crimes they don&rsquo;t and cannot have ever, committed.<br/>
Never mind the generations of whites _lost_ because their fathers and uncles went to war to save the world from becoming exactly what it in fact has.<br/>
First you demoralize them. Then you destabilize them. Then you throw them into crisis. And then you come up with &#8216;heroes&rsquo; to save them with with whackadoodle dogma as revolution. And then the heroes, their jobs done, all get a bullet and disappear down a self-dug hole and the rest of society have to live with the consequences of their programmed betrayal.<br/>
How about this instead: Racism is a useful tool for sorting successful ingroup genes from unsuccessful outgroup genes and confining the social benefits which enable those genes to move forward, within the group.<br/>
Racism is an evolutionary tool of extreme utility because the world is about competing Genetic Algorithms in a fixed resource base habitat from which only those _kind to themselves_ (sure, why not &#8216;privilege&rsquo;) can secure a future based on loyalty to one&rsquo;s own group.</p>

<p>The United States won&rsquo;t survive much longer. How can it? The most productive elements of society are being taught to hate themselves and every year more non-whites are added to the brown burden for white tax payers to provide for.<br/>
It&rsquo;s no wonder why countries like Russia seem to be getting less scared of the USA. America is a degenerate sewer, it ought to be laughed at instead of feared.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-574064" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The United States is unsustainable. Republics can&rsquo;t handle over 300 million people from multiple disparate groups. Rome for example grew too big and its humble republic couldn&rsquo;t handle the weight of so many nations. The Soviet Union is another example of an empire held together by duct tape. The only republics that have historically &#8220;worked&#8221; are the ones that have pretty small, homogeneous populations and have huge natural boundaries like Iceland and Switzerland.</p>

So long as the population of a nation remains homogenous in the 90th percentile or so it should survive.

I will say that the way things are now, if we&rsquo;re to have a real future, for the time being we&rsquo;re going to need some strong man right wing populist-nationalist unafraid to use the pen and the phone to benefit white people. We must stop public political rhetoric about &#8220;saving the Constitution,&#8221; saving a dying and terminally ill document that the current President has done more than his fair share to kill, but a document that has been dying for some time even without his &#8220;help.&#8221; All I know is that the day the Constitution officially dies, I want someone sitting at the Resolute desk with the pen and the phone and control over what is still the world&rsquo;s biggest and most powerful military who is a lot more like Vladimir Putin and a lot less like Barack Obama.</p>

<p>&#8220;We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and OUR POSTERITY, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.&#8221; </p>
<p>And three years later, the Naturalization Act of 1790 (Wikipedia):</p>
<p>The original United States Naturalization Law of March 26, 1790 . . . provided the first rules to be followed by the United States in the granting of national citizenship. This law limited naturalization to immigrants who were &#8220;free white persons&#8221; of &#8220;good moral character&#8221;.</p>

I know for sure that it prohibits military bellicosity outside of Japanese territory. However, I&rsquo;ll say it again: If the document is explicitly anti-nationalist, and the people it attempts to govern want ethnonationalism, then they are far more likely than not to have ethnonationalist public policies.</p>

But even if it did say exactly what we wanted, if people quit believing it, then the words on paper are of no use. An overtly racialist set of governing documents applied to people that don&rsquo;t believe racialism won&rsquo;t result in racialist policies.</p>
<p>Likewise, even if one wants to buy this silly notion that Thomas Jefferson (slave owner) was some sort of racial egalitarian, and encoded it into the Declaration of Independence (not a governing document), the obvious solution is not to believe in racial egalitarianism.</p>

Ironically, they hate the same things that a White racial realist traditionalist hates. They hate the Leftist secular West of casual sex, buying meaningless junk, and Negro music. The West they hate is the same West I hate, the West of White Leftists that have Negroized sexual morals, put talentless Negro musicians on a pedestal by buying their garbage albums, and buy chintzy, loud, gaudy clothing like Negroes to show off their income. In short, the West that the Islamists hate is far from the true West. The West they hate is the vapid, substance free, Negro worshiping Leftist doofus contingent that is a blend of the Jewish money lender with the brain dead Negro. </p>

By those words he simply meant that men are (or should be) equal before God and equal under the law. He had no illusions that all men were equal in talent, intelligence, or moral integrity, even among whites alone. It follows that he did not demand or expect equality in outcomes. It is the left that has twisted the meaning of those words. So when you criticize the Declaration of Independence for containing those words you are actually buying into the program of the left.</p>

This is the type of civilization the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution for. Jefferson felt strongly that Negroes should not, and could not, be integrated into American society. Rhodesia is an excellent example of what happens when Whites assume that Negroes can adapt to, and respect the mores of, White societies. Negroes cannot and will not do so. This is why The Boer Genocide is taking place. What we consider to be anarchy and chaos is normal behavior for Negroes. They are a violent, contentious race that needs to live separately from Whites. </p>

A dead Constitution simply means that the anti-white federal government is free to oppress you worse than ever. It can read all your emails. It can record all your phone conversations. Through the IRS it knows every detail of your financial life, and can examine your credit card records to find out about everything you&rsquo;ve ever bought. The president can declare you a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; and strip you of all your legal rights to a fair and open trial. The government already has the power to flatten you like a bug. And you&rsquo;re hoping for a leader with even more power? All the evidence I see is that the federal government is using its power to create the laws you hate, not the ones you&rsquo;d like to have. Having Jeb Bush as president won&rsquo;t improve things. And no, Jared Taylor will never be president.</p>

His name is David Brat, a Republican; who beat the House Majority leader who had spent 100X more dollars-still lost. The Republicans will keep the House and retake the Senate in the Fall. Obama Bin Laden&rsquo;s continued destruction of America as a lame duck will likely guarantee a Republican president in 2016. 2016 is anybody&rsquo;s guess, but I see reversal and momentum, not the end.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-574447" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think you may be conflating two different things.</p>
<p>It has been said in quite a few different studies and articles I have seen that the White racial group developed to be more altruistic to the wider world and yet more prone to being individualistic than other groups. </p>
<p>In and throughout our development, these things probably served us very well and could perhaps have been described as aspects of good genetics working in our collective survival process. </p>
<p>Such traits, however, could quite easily be turned against us and worked to disadvantage our race - by creating an environment where they are exploited and manipulated by some very clever people who had figured out how to do this for their own ends.</p>
<p>I think this environment aspect is important, because different traits could be described as superior depending on the situation that presents itself.</p>
<p>For example, having a degree in mathematics or being less prone to sickle-cell anaemia would not be all that superior in a situation where you are one of two people running from a hungry lion, the other being somebody with African genetics of the variety that has consecutively won the Olympics in the marathon or sprint.</p>

They will list Hispanics as &#8220;White&#8221; every chance they get, for example. &#8220;White&#8221; as translated to the various founding western Europeans is probably less than 1/3. Purely statistically speaking. The rest are imposters like Muslim, Tribe, Armenian, Persian, Hispanic, etc. This was done to disguise the levels of institutionalized white-replacement taking place, IMO. </p>
<p>Falsely listing Hispanics as &#8220;White&#8221; also reduces the high minority crime rate numbers, and moves them to the low crime &#8220;White&#8221; column. Here is an example that circulates at AmRen from time to time. Notice the &#8220;White&#8221; classification.<br/>

<p>I find Googling it from my phone is even better than a link to a static picture, because I can say, &#8220;watch this, I&rsquo;m going to go straight to the FBI website, and show you something&#8221; and show them that right now, this very second, X number of mestizo criminals are classified as white.

It would not be plagued by Whites adopting Black sexual degeneracy, Whites choosing to make talentless Negro singers/rappers wealthy by buying their garbage, or weak willed Whites buying drugs from Blacks and immitating their degenerate behaviors, as the media has constantly told them to worship Blacks. Integration has been a failure. Blacks drag Whites down far more than we have raised Blacks up, thus the sorry state of affairs in America and the West. A White society either properly segregated, or free of Blacks entirely, is best. </p>

The 40 million or so non-White illegal aliens are counted as &#8220;Americans&#8221; when they&rsquo;re not, so are the millions of non-White legal residents, workers, students etc. Only the racial percentages of American citizens should be counted when it comes to racial numbers.

<p>In the meantime, yesterday evening, I did a quick search and I discovered what this Brooks fellow had said.</p>
<p> I was expecting it to be some kind of major outburst. In actuality, it was pretty tame and rather multiracial/multicultural in theme.</p>
<p>The part about there being a war on whites was rather small, but it is interesting how such a small comment, a single line or sentence, can cause such a commotion in all the newspaper columns. </p>
<p>On this hypersensitivity, on this &#8220;Broken Windows&#8221; form of thought policing, you can smell the fear of any sort of white consciousness arriving and taking hold. </p>
<p>Jared Taylor threads together a great expose on what is really happening in America and how utterly daft it all is! No wonder they wanted it removing - because the liberals simply cannot refute what is being said. They do not like it, not one little bit.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-574604" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>according to crime victim surveys, sponsored by the FBI around 2004?, 53% of white victims survey claimed the perp was black. Among blacks, something like 3% said the perp was white. Some statics seemed astounding, blacks were something like 110 times more likely to rob a white person than the other way around. 33 times more likely to assault. Blacks were 2 1/2 times more likely to be charged with officially designated hate crime. One wonders if hate crimes are being selectively enforced. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m less sure about the following statics, but I think blacks were from 8 to 16 times more likely to murder a white than the other way around. Every black man in this nation, brother, father, son or husband, is over 600 times more likely to rape a white woman than any given white man is to rape a black woman.</p>
<p>They only released this statistics, around the year 2,000, as an effort to keep the white crime rate down. </p>

I admire your passion for self-defense, but what are you going to do when your neighborhood goes Third World, run up and down the street shooting people? I doubt it, and what good would it do? In South Africa they haven&rsquo;t needed to send Whites to FEMA camps or go house to house grabbing guns. Whites are being erased by demographics, dispossession and &#8216;random&rsquo; violent crime. An obvious &#8220;holocaust&#8221; would be unnecessary and stupid, since it would organize Whites. However, either way, Whites need to get organized. Otherwise at best we will be erased one by one over a century or two.</p>

If someone pushes me, I will reveal my opinions. So many former friends now give me the cold shoulder&hellip;ironically liberal whites are the the most anti-white. Most people know the truth and will reveal their opinions privately or via the internet. If you look at non-moderated comments sections of news sites, the vast majority of comments are race realist. It is not a few angry old white people, as the liberals sneer&hellip;there are tens of millions of us that feel the same way. Even some non-whites admit to the truth. At this time, we have several &#8220;internet warriors&#8221;. People are coming out to rebel though. (as in Murrietta when they turned the busses full of illegals back). I found that most people in my family and my business colleagues feel this way. In the &#8220;real world&#8221;, where people pay taxes and produce, no one likes Obama care nor Affirmative action. The white liberal woman with buzz cut and nose ring no longer talks to me. That&rsquo;s too bad and all, but I will live. Eventually though, even she will figure it out&hellip; after she becomes a victim. Amren is a good place to start. Come here for sanity and level-headed commentary.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-574946" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I remember, I believe it was, Muhammed Ali being interviewed. The interviewer asked about another black in newsmaker. I honestly don&rsquo;t remember if it was someone more militant than even Ali, or if it was some kind of Bill Cosby like character. Ali said that each angle, and each person had a part to play. Each was doing something for the cause or in combating white supremacy. I believe he had a good metaphor to describe it - each building one part of the product or something (although that was not the metaphor).</p>
<p>When I read about Youtube blocking the video, and when I go to the library and AmRen is blocked, the reason coming up listed as &#8216;discrimination&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m reminded of Ali&rsquo;s interview, and I think we need more people on our side. If we&rsquo;re being rejected, we will need to play the within the rules in order to be heard. We need different methods. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with squeaky clean White Nationalism. How about a &#8216;White Nationalism&rsquo; that doesn&rsquo;t mention blacks whatsoever? I&rsquo;d say &#8216;other races&rsquo; but everyone is obsessed with blacks. In truth, every time we discuss them it just gives them more power and takes away from our agenda. We need more websites. Maybe John Engelman could run one (even though in my opinion even he is at times too &#8216;racist&rsquo; and controversial).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the white student union. It&rsquo;s a great idea and those forming them should get our support. A white student union needs to be open to students from all sides of the political spectrum, and of course, non-whites. It can&rsquo;t be overtly political or else it&rsquo;s serving some kind of special interest and not the student body. Sure, those who join are liable to say anything, but those who run it need to take some kind of neutral stance (no matter what their politics or views are) when it comes social issues and club endorsements (if there are any). No 20 point demands, yet. AmRen themselves are neutral on many issues. I remember Jared Taylor saying something like, If whites have their own territory, their societies would evolve along &#8216;whatever form in would naturally take&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it enough to just meet other whites interested in such idea. Even if they want to make some kind of point joining the club, or are simply doing so as a duty because &#8216;diversity demands it&rsquo;. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be enough just to meet as white students in our own club? I know it would have been welcome when I was a student and noticing things weren&rsquo;t quite right. What&rsquo;s wrong with just meeting with no agenda&rsquo;s other than that? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be enough as a start?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not held to the same standard, we can talk about that, but we have to conform to what the standards are. </p>
<p>No one needs to formulate a master plan or have a complete theory of all (as much as I tend to talk about that kind of stuff, myself, posting). There Are places for cranks, and for every one. There are some places that would be better off turning them away.<br/>
As far as I know, there&rsquo;s just AmRen. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here. We need more places and others making videos too.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-574990" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I am just going to write this off the top of my head, but although I think I know what you are driving at&hellip;..I think it is a bit too late in the day for some of the methodology I think is being proposed here.</p>
<p>For example, the American Renaissance website is on the whole a squeaky clean (sometimes painfully so) organisation which goes to great lengths to distance itself from the murkier elements of the cause or, for example, those who are more condemning of a particular race who they see as being the main manipulators of our situation (rightly or wrongly).</p>
<p>Does Amren get an easy time for its efforts? Is it deemed acceptable to our opponents and wider liberals? No. Not really. As you say, there are blocks to the website in the library, the conferences are picketed and venues threatened, the media still describes it as being all the usual smear words. </p>
<p>If &#8220;playing by the rules&#8221; means further bowing down to the wishes and norms of our opponents and playing to the rules they cast over us all, then, no, I am sorry, we cannot and should not be playing by those rules.</p>
<p>They are rules under which we can never win. They are also rules which could only serve to water down and jumble up what the fight is actually about, if the rules mean being advocates of playing with and playing by the rules of those who are lukewarm to the aims of people here. </p>
<p>What is deemed &#8220;crackpottery&#8221; or &#8216;crank&rsquo; is also open for debate. For example, you get some much more fruity material over at the Occidental Observer in relation to the &#8220;JQ&#8221; - but by no means would I consider them cranks.</p>
<p>Far from it being crankery or something to cordon off, I would say it was very important to have some of this knowledge on show and for it to be there so that others can become aware of these things. So, on that, it is horses for courses. </p>
<p>But there is of course a difference between those who have a little bit of self control and those who do not. Those who are what I would consider the liabilities - the people who use racial epithets endlessly, talk in unnecessarily cruel and crude ways, even relish in how forthright and &#8216;tough&rsquo; they are on the subject.</p>
<p>It is more important that people control themselves on this kind of thing than force themselves into topical straitjackets or brush aspects of the cause under the carpet because they risk being labelled in some way.</p>
<p>As for websites, sometimes I think there may be too many of them. There is counter-currents, alternative-right, Taki, Vdare, Radix, Occidental Observer, Amren, many lesser known ones like Majority Rights, then you get down to bloggers, and so on.</p>
<p>Whilst they all have their own thing going on, and the variety is good and spans a whole range of sections from libertarianism, anarchism, paleoconservative, etc, I sometimes wonder whether there is any actual strategy and common goals between them all beyond that of being supportive of each others aims.</p>
<p>There is often a little too much to read and keep up with, where the message can get lost. Yet each site is a rung on the ladder for people who drop into this fight from a different angle. </p>
<p>Regarding the talking about blacks, I understand your point and I would agree. In Britain, I think the parallel would be &#8216;Muslims&rsquo;. Everywhere you go it seems to be about Muslims here, less so Blacks.</p>
<p>But the effect is the same, too much time is spent discussing what crimes they are committing, what they are doing, and so on - instead of what *WE* are doing or going to do about it. </p>
<p>That is why I am currently a supporter of the Western Spring project in England, because the focus is upon the right things&hellip;..what we need to do, not just what everybody else is doing to us. </p>
<p>The only counter I have to this aspect of internet chatter, is that if Muslims (say) are a catalyst that draws people our way, then perhaps the chatter is something we have to continue to push people further up the ladder. </p>
<p>I suppose it depends on what people want from a movement and for a site, ie, what purpose each site is supposed to serve.</p>

There is a place for those who play by the multicultural rules, whatever they are. At the very least, it forces them to reject you because you are white, and for no other reason.</p>
<p>I have to admit that, on campus, when faced with serious resistance it simply forces them to do a better job at what they do. The are forced to put a more reasonable face on what they do. Their edicts and logic becomes more rational. When faced with resistance they simply become better racists.</p>
<p>Then again, resistance began to grow among underlings at these &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; sessions at work. Tolerance training in a class-like atmosphere seems to have ended. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-575888" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I suppose I just think that there are enough places already for the people who wish to play by the multiracial rules.</p>
<p>For example, the kind of &#8216;patriot&rsquo; websites and movements, the Tea Party (here, UKIP) type sites, your kind of &#8216;National Review&rsquo; groups, the Bruges Group here in England, etc, which represent the &#8216;traditional right&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Tommy Robinson, former EDL leader, is another one who - despite media storms - obeys and truly believes in the multicultural rules. He is fine with multiracialism, multiculturalism, etc, and attacks Islam only as being a threat to these things. On all else, he plays the liberal handbook perfectly. The wider &#8216;counter-jihad&rsquo; movement is the same to some degree, with Gates of Vienna and so on.</p>
<p>Then there are anti-immigration groups and organisations (such as &#8220;Migration Watch&#8221; here) and such groups which spend all their time toeing the multicultural line and couching their arguments in purely terms of economics, quality of life, overcrowding, etc. (This is because this is actually what concerns them, not anything else). </p>
<p>There are a lot of sites and organisations like this which skirt around the issues trying to be &#8220;acceptable&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;.but whilst there is perhaps a place for it, for our ultimate aims and objectives I think it is the wrong course to take.</p>
<p>This is where the attitude and the approach of the &#8220;alternative right&#8221; comes in - where we are bold, proud and forthright in our positions and why we hold them, but generally refrain from the kind of arguments and terminology that fulfils all the wrong stereotypes pitted against us. </p>
<p>I think that by continuing on those lines (and by brushing off the nonsense that bogs us all down) we can be an example and perhaps cause interest in people to find out where we are really coming from. Their concept of what we are about is often very different from what they are led to believe. </p>
<p>This discipline is what I think is important to encourage in others, and, like earlier, I think it is important to be seen to be doing things for the right reasons rather than the wrong ones. </p>
<p>For example, rather than complaining that Blacks are domineering basketball, or scrounging welfare, or getting a new community centre in the name of &#8220;keeping young people off the street&#8221;&hellip;&hellip; encourage whites to take up basketball and make their own teams, encourage and help whites not to be on welfare (help raise our own game), try and establish our own hangouts and clubs to try and keep our own people out of any trouble. </p>
<p>Not the best examples, but I hope you know what I mean.</p>
<p>I have no idea what it is like in America, especially on a school/college campus. I am not sure what a &#8220;White Student Union&#8221; would do, to be honest. But in the same way as above, it would help to make it actually about things of interest to whites, about being pro-white, not &#8220;against&#8221; everybody else. </p>
<p>This way, I assume, there would be less for people to attack, and nor would it really mean bumbling around with &#8220;multiculturally acceptable&#8221; language, messages, discourse. </p>
<p>It is not an easy task. It is easy for me to say it, but in real life it can be quite different. </p>
<p>One aspect of the New Right model is to not pander to the agenda, terms, objectives and arguments of our opponents.</p>
<p>On this, all we are then doing is perpetuating it and playing a game on somebody else&rsquo;s terms and rules. It is a system in which we can never win.</p>
<p>These people are not our masters, we have to shake off the idea that they are in control or should be allowed the moral authority. Providing we emit the right messages and can aptly defend ourselves, we may at least get somewhere?&hellip;..</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-575916" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>When I think of the alternative right, or the third way, I think of Nazis. Perhaps I buy too much into the mainstream media. The new right has a better sound to it.<br/>
We should do more for the downtrodden, we should also support excellence. It&rsquo;s not too complicated figuring out what a pro-white organization should do. There are endless non-white interest groups, clubs, pressure groups and organization. Just do what they do, although, admittedly, recognizing we&rsquo;ll be held to a different standard. I think any white interest group has to be politically neutral. I know Jared Taylor often takes a right wing position, and perhaps that is what most white groups will inevitably do as this is what is &#8216;best for most whites&rsquo; or even most whites who join feel this way.<br/>
Perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong, but I think white groups are more need than non-white groups. Whether because of history (or conditioning or because of their lack of consciousness), or whether because in may cities and neighborhood whites are becoming a smaller and smaller groups.<br/>
At some point we have to go full white. It&rsquo;s funny, watching &#8216;anti-immigrant&rsquo; and such groups squirm as they try and deny there is anything &#8216;white&rsquo; about them. That&rsquo;s fine for them but some of us must just embrace it: we&rsquo;re interested in the condition of whites and what&rsquo;s best for them. Let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s going to come. Those who are accomplished and those likely leftists will likely lead it. I&rsquo;m sure there is a place for us to.<br/>
I agree with you. We have to frame these things in our own terms and there are some things we shouldn&rsquo;t talk about. Jared Taylor mentioned that, when you&rsquo;re invited to an interview or TV show they expect you to talk. Try and minimize talking about subject you&rsquo;d prefer not to, I guess. You&rsquo;re a white special interest group, not a special interest group for people of color. There are already enough people concerned about them as it is.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t have a white student union on any campus (no matter the demographics or history), while there are numerous student groups for other races. . I don&rsquo;t know. You at least made the attempt. Again, white student unions won&rsquo;t face the same standards as other groups, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t make the effort whatever that might be. Hell, even a white student union, dedicated to nothing but eradicating the evils of white privilege, that would be a start. It would also be the minimum a university, for example, should be required to meet in order to fulfill the diversity obligations with which they seem to find so sacred.</p>

<p>The attack on whites is actually quite similar to the attack on Jews. I hate resorting to such parallels because it has become an extremely abused analogy, but it bears some core resemblance. And I believe it all boils down to a superior group of people who have built a civilization which has attracted the world&rsquo;s attention due to its success. Previously, the attraction was &#8220;opportunity&#8221; where the American dream included ideals of working hard to achieve goals in life. In those days, we were a &#8220;melting pot&#8221; where we could become &#8220;one people&#8221; despite the disparate backgrounds.</p>
<p>But now we have a different problem. We have groups of people who cannot and will not &#8220;melt&#8221; in the pot of the American system. We also have groups of people who do not seek opportunity, but instead seek only the unearned &#8220;reward&#8221; of the US welfare system. It&rsquo;s worse than &#8220;we don&rsquo;t want them&#8221; here. It&rsquo;s &#8220;we can&rsquo;t sustain them any longer&#8221; and it&rsquo;s actually destroying this country. This isn&rsquo;t a fear of what might happen, it&rsquo;s the horror of what IS happening now.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-575050" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Another excellent presentation by Jared Taylor highlighting the war that has been declared on Whites. We need to know about things such as that insidious Duluth billboard, geared to making impressionable Whites feel guilty for being White. I find that billboard particularly disturbing. It is specifically targeting Whites in an area with few Blacks/Hispanics who should be keeping their area White. Duluth is one of America&rsquo;s safest cities specifically due to demographics. The Duluth area does not offer many job opportunities, but does offer an exceptionally cold winter. The last thing the good, decent, law abiding working class White population of Duluth needs is an influx of Negroes/Hispanics. Most Whites in the Duluth area are descended from Scandinavian and Eastern European immigrants who came to America with nothing but their will to work and better themselves. They did just that, and did so through hard work, sacrifice, and self discipline. There wasn&rsquo;t any White privilege for them, just prejudice from Yankees settlers from the East against non-English European immigrants. Whoever is responsible for this insulting and insidious billboard should be confronted with a lawsuit for slander by the White residents of Duluth. There was never any White privilege for European immigrants to this country. The Leftist Negro lover responsible for this slanderous billboard deserves to be homeless and scrounging for this next morsel of food, being bullied by the Negroes they love so much. </p>

<p>Continued caucasian immigration from North Africa, Middle East and Western and Central Asia will boost the number of caucasians in America while making the white minority even smaller. Ignorant white americans will continue to bleat about having a &#8220;caucasian&#8221; majority while lamenting the large number of 3rd world darkies on the street.

The average White American is being bombarded with anti-White media propaganda non-stop. Only those of us who are either independent minded enough to look through this insidious brainwashing, or who have had first hand experience with non-Whites, are laying the media brainwashing assault aside. Our elites are convinced that diversity is somehow going to benefit them. The media assault is authorized and encouraged by them for this reason. How they think that lazy, unintelligent Negroes/Hispanics being placed in jobs due to AA quotas, not ability, will benefit their quest to make millions is beyond me. Capable and dedicated White workers are the bedrock on which their fortunes are built. AA monkeys are bringing their fortunes down, wrecking their empires. Just look at what hiring huge numbers of Negroes into the auto industry accomplished. Detroit became known for no assembly quality. We basically handed the keys to the industry to the Asian carmakers by hiring lazy, incompetent Negroes. </p>

We are strong racial realists here, and we communicate the truth here about Negro sociopathy. I post here often, and am under no illusions as far as the behaviors Negroes are inclined to. America is in a very low place right now spiritually. We have a Mulatto race hustler in the White House, a typical everything is about race Negro who has no business being President, but is there because he is Black. I&rsquo;ve been around Blacks a lot in my life. I would say that 99% of them have a sociopathic mindset. Honesty, hard work, and a job well done are things they view as cheesy. They believe in doing as little work as possible, and screaming about racism when their abhorrent behavior comes back to bite them. Thomas Jefferson and Abe Lincoln believed that Whites and Blacks must remain separate, or severe problems would result. We should have sent them back to Africa after the Civil War. About this, I have no doubt whatsoever. Keep your head up, my friend, and keep fighting the good fight. The Blacks will try to ruin your day. They are a cruel, degenerate race.

actions of the US government around the death of President Kennedy. On NPR Jim<br/>

<p>November 22, 1963, the<br/>
day America as we knew ceased to exist. The day power passed from the white<br/>
gentile to the …………</p>
<p>The US government has<br/>
stripped white Americans of our civil liberties. The US Government has opened<br/>
our borders and has refused to enforce our immigration laws.</p>
<p>What has the Republican<br/>
Party done for me, a white gentile who has given the party my allegiance and<br/>
support? NOTHING! We are not represented by our government nor the Republican<br/>
and Democratic Parties.</p>
<p>What are you going to<br/>
give me for my vote?</p>
<p>Another point of<br/>
view…..time is of the essence. </p>
<p>Do We Jump or Die?</p>
<p>If you drop a frog in<br/>
a pot of boiling water, it will of course frantically try to clamber out. But<br/>
if you place it gently in a pot of tepid water and turn the heat on low, it<br/>
will float there quite placidly. As the water gradually heats up, the frog will<br/>
sink into a tranquil stupor, exactly like one of us in a hot bath, and before<br/>
long, with a smile on its face, it will allow itself to be boiled to death.</p>
<p>Version of the story<br/>
from Daniel Quinn&rsquo;s The Story of B</p>
<p>There were once a<br/>
bunch of white Christian frogs existing as a majority in a homogeneous<br/>
Christian world with our black brothers and sisters. The Jews the world did not<br/>
want took refuge in our country and created the Utopia of Multiculturalism. The<br/>
blacks and Jews got together and decided that white frogs were the evil<br/>
majority who had oppressed the world and could not have the same opportunities<br/>
as the Jews, the black frogs and the brown frogs. Laws were passed stripping<br/>
the white frogs of all power. The Southern Poverty Law Center was established<br/>
to make sure no white frog rebelled. Fox news was created to help the white<br/>
frogs form politically correct attitudes. Rush and Glen helped the white frogs<br/>
control their white anger. The Jews passed laws to immigrate only brown frogs<br/>
into America. Oprah said all the old white frogs must die before we know the<br/>
end of racism. Our Africa born (?) black POTUS came from the land of Black<br/>
Liberation Theology and totally agreed because Rev. Wright and Frank Marshall<br/>
Davis taught him well. The privileged white Jew, Tim Wise wrote books and gave<br/>
lectures about the &ldquo;evil weak- willed, genetically defective, culturally<br/>
retarded white privileged European peasant frogs&rdquo;&hellip;. The reasonable white<br/>
frogs brought into the tyranny of Multiculturalism. You know the story.</p>
<p>As the heat is slowly<br/>
turned up, something happens. One of the frogs looks around, and actually<br/>
notices the heat. He begins analyzing and forecasting what this rising<br/>
temperature means for his future. He jumps out of the pot and encourages others<br/>
to do the same. While the others are afraid of the risk of leaving,<br/>
he is afraid of the risk of becoming extinct due to inaction.<br/>
(Copied from the website Patriot Page)</p>
<p>The time is now, we<br/>
either JUMP or DIE. </p>
<p>This is the first time<br/>
in the history of civilization that a majority population has given up its<br/>
sovereignty without a bloody battle.</p>
<p>If we remain on this<br/>
path the destiny of America will be parallel to the destiny of Russia. What a cataclysmic disaster the Jewish<br/>
provoked Russian Revolution was for humanity! Were the Jews incapable of foreseeing<br/>
the outcome of their actions or was the USSR the desired outcome. What will be<br/>
the future of America, Europe, Australia and Canada? The Western world is being<br/>
deconstructed by the Jews just as Russia was. What will be our future? Will we<br/>
have a future? Can you name me one time in history in which Jewish Activism<br/>
created a positive result?</p>
<p>To stop the Jews we must<br/>
convince the decent Jews of the world to stand up to their fellow Jews. Harry<br/>
Pottery is an allegory of the struggle of good and evil within the Jewish<br/>
community. Our only hope is that the decent Jews of the world will stop the<br/>
insanity to save the muggles. Whites are powerless to stand against the tide of<br/>
destiny which is engulfing the Western World.</p>
<p>Are you going to<br/>
stand for America?</p>

Still unsatisfied they have insisted upon elevating non-whites into jobs they have proven they cannot perform, by eliminating the basic and fundamental tests for such critical positions as firefighting and air traffic control that these non-whites cannot pass.</p>
<p>Even when secured into the workplace, minorities are now often guaranteed professional success at the expense of their white associates. At the National Institues of Health (NIH), for example, it wasn&rsquo;t enough that research proposals were judged blindly; when the proposals who happened to have been submitted by blacks (especially) were not approved at a rate equal to whites&rsquo;, policy was forced upon NIH to approve a minimum number of blacks&rsquo; proposals, even though the value of some of those to the advancement of scientific inquiry has been judged substandard to those of whites which otherwise would have instead been funded.</p>
<p>I imagine it&rsquo;s not unreasonable to expect, now, if it hasn&rsquo;t already happened, that non-whites will be guaranteed a quota of &#8220;Best Of&#8221; awards in all fields of endeavor, to &#8220;correct&#8221; those &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; imbalances as well.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-589450" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>From one White brother to another. I say thank you for both the post itself, and the advice within it friend! However, I must sadly confess that I see a future for White America that will parallel that of White South Africa. From what I understand South Africa never actually existed until Whites alone birthed it into existence. The land that makes up South Africa was scarcely populated by smaller tribes and a larger Zulu tribe to the north. However, South Africa only became the South Africa that we know today. After Whites arrived and literally built the entire Nation from nothing. After White South African&rsquo;s began to built their Nation into a thriving civilization the black tribesmen decided that they wanted to leave their mud huts and spears behind, and live like the White man.</p>
<p>After Whites allowed them to live within the society they began to think Whitey&rsquo;s civilization was somehow their birthright. Even though they themselves have shown and proven to be incapable of creating such a civilization on their own. They have the gall to actually claim ownership to the White created Nation of South Africa for no other reason than they are black. However, if the rest of the world, especially my own treasonous government ( US ) hadn&rsquo;t turned on White South Africans they would&rsquo;ve never been able to gain control the way they did. And now, directly due to that treachery. They are busy running the White created civilization and Nation State of South Africa, into the ground.</p>
<p>Hopefully it won&rsquo;t get as bad in South Africa as its been in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Ah yes, good old Rhodesia. Born a White Nation named Rhodesia, and died a black &#8220;nation&#8221; named Zimbabwe. One thrived and produced so much food it fed half the continent. The other sank and couldn&rsquo;t even feed itself without depending upon the kindness of other White Nations feeding it&rsquo;s people for them. Yet, as far as the liberal history books go. One was the embodiment of evil, and the other is all about freedom. Idiocy is rampant these days, and from what I can see it appears to be contagious. So let me just close with this. From one White brother to another, I say stay, and stand strong my friend, our history demands it.</p>
