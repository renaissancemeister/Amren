<h1 class="title">Greatest Comeback: Nixon, Buchanan, and George Wallace</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, August 15, 2014</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
An insider&rsquo;s look at the 1968 presidential campaign.</div> 
</div> 



<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Patrick J. Buchanan, <em>The Greatest Comeback: How Nixon Rose from Defeat to Create the New Majority</em>, Crown Forum, 2014, 400 pp., $28.00.</strong></p>
<p>Patrick Buchanan is the most prominent American who speaks openly of the importance of preserving our historic nation. As he wrote in his 2006 book, <em>State of Emergency</em>, &#8220;If we do not get control of our borders, by 2050 Americans of European descent will be a minority in the nation their ancestors created and built,&#8221; and &#8220;should America lose her ethnic-cultural core and become a nation of nations, America will not survive.&#8221; In 2011, he pointed out in <em>Suicide of a Superpower</em> that as the American population becomes blacker and more Hispanic our international competitiveness will decline.</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan&rsquo;s latest book, <em>The Greatest Comeback</em>, is about Richard Nixon&rsquo;s road to the White House after two crushing defeats that should have finished his career as a politician. It is actually more about Mr. Buchanan-his role as confidant and policy adviser-but it throws light on the complex figure of Richard Nixon and is an engaging account of presidential politicking in what was one of modern America&rsquo;s most turbulent years: 1968. This is not an openly dissident book like some of his others, but it includes insights into the role of race in American politics, and what Mr. Buchanan writes about the third-party candidacy of George Wallace-which could have kept Nixon out of the White House-is especially interesting.</p>
<p><strong>The young devotee</strong></p>
<p>Nixon had served for two terms as Dwight Eisenhower&rsquo;s vice president before he ran against John Kennedy in 1960. He was one of the country&rsquo;s best known politicians and had every hope of winning, but lost by one of the thinnest margins in American history. Eisenhower&rsquo;s support had been tepid, the Republican Party was disorganized, and the press never liked Nixon. Even Kennedy privately conceded that the press was unfair.</p>
<p>Nixon went home, and in 1962 ran for governor of California, confident this would be the perfect office from which to make another bid for the White House in 1968. It was another loss. In his concession speech after his defeat by Pat Brown, he declared he would never run again and took his famous poke at the press: &ldquo;Think of all the fun you&rsquo;ll be missing . . . . You don&rsquo;t have Nixon to kick around anymore . . . .�?</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan followed these events from afar, and had the insight to recognize that Nixon was likely to run again and could win. He appears to have been fascinated with conservative politics all his life; in 1955 he had even caddied for Vice President Nixon. In 1965, he wangled a meeting, in which he told Nixon, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to run in &rsquo;68, I&rsquo;d like to get aboard early.�? After an interview that Mr. Buchanan describes as &ldquo;exhausting,�? in which Nixon grilled him on his views on every aspect of politics, he was hired to handle Nixon&rsquo;s correspondence and help him write a monthly syndicated column. Mr. Buchanan had a somewhat larger view of his role: to do everything possible to make Nixon the next President of the United States. Mr. Buchanan-27 years old-soon became part of the inner circle.</p>
<p><strong>George Wallace</strong></p>
<p>Most of the <em>The Greatest Comeback</em> is about the inner workings of the Nixon political machine: how his advisers helped craft policy positions, how Nixon won the nomination, the turning points in the campaign, the challenges of dealing with the press, etc. Mr. Buchanan gives us a good look at the underside of American democracy, as he describes how carefully Nixon&rsquo;s managers crafted his messages to follow the polls, and how every step had to be weighed in terms of how the press would react.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting parts of the book, however, is how the Nixon team dealt with George Wallace. Today, Wallace is mostly dismissed as a primitive white supremacist, but in the 1960s, he cut an impressive figure. Mr. Buchanan reminds us that 1968 was a profoundly traumatic and divisive year that offered a perfect opening for a populist spoiler such as Wallace. The North Vietnamese drove the Americans out of the Marine combat base in Khe Sanh after a siege that lasted for months. Americans were terrified by the Tet Offensive. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated. Cities went up in flames. Demonstrators paralyzed elite universities. As Mr. Buchanan notes, it was certainly not what President Lyndon Johnson expected when he lit the Washington Christmas tree shortly after his 1964 landslide election and said, &ldquo;These are the most hopeful times in all the years since Christ was born in Bethlehem.�?</p>
<p>In this context, as Mr. Buchanan writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wallace was an ideal backlash candidate. He had been for five years America&rsquo;s most outspoken opponent of integration. He had denounced hippies, rioters, and campus anarchists with a populist rhetoric Nixon could not match. He was a demon campaigner with a brutal but effective sense of humor. Everywhere he went the crowds were big and excited.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wallace could appeal to conservative whites in ways that were off limits to Nixon. &ldquo;Had Nixon dared to try,�? notes Mr. Buchanan, &ldquo;he would have crippled himself with his base of centrists and independents.�?</p>
<p>In his 1962 inaugural address as governor of Alabama, Wallace had promised to &#8220;make race the basis for politics in this state, and . . . the basis of politics in this country.&#8221; For his 1968 presidential campaign, he started a new party, the American Independent Party, and got a place on the ballot in all 50 states. He laughed at Washington bureaucrats, whom he called &#8220;pin-head social theorists&#8221; and &#8220;pointy-headed intellectuals who can&rsquo;t even park a bicycle straight.&#8221; &#8220;And what do you think they carry around in those fancy brief cases?&#8221; he would ask to roars of laughter. &#8220;Ham sandwiches.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Nixon and his Democratic opponent Hubert Humphrey, Wallace warned that &#8220;there&rsquo;s not a dime&rsquo;s worth of difference between them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once when Wallace was heckled by hippies, he called out to them:</p>
<blockquote><p>You come up when I get through and I&rsquo;ll autograph your sandals for you. That is, if you got any on . . . You need a good haircut. That&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s wrong with you. . . There are two four-letter words I bet you folks <em>don&rsquo;t</em> know: &#8216;work&rsquo; and &#8216;soap.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Nixon had none of this off-the-cuff appeal.</p>
<p>Wallace was immensely popular in the South and with working people in the North. At his high point, pollsters predicted he could win 20 percent of the vote. Mr. Buchanan calculated that 60 to 65 percent of the electorate was sick of Lyndon Johnson and the Democrats, but worried that Wallace could take so many votes from Nixon that no one would get enough electoral votes to win, and the election would be decided in the House of Representatives. The Democrat-dominated house would have handed the White House to Humphrey.</p>
<p>How to solve the problem? It is fascinating to learn that in 1968, Republicans were already bewitched by the futile hope of attracting more blacks and Jews (today they would include Hispanics). Even among Nixon&rsquo;s advisers there was a group lead by William Safire, who wanted to tack left. Mr. Buchanan calls this the &ldquo;Bring Us Together�? view, which &#8220;some of us had come to regard as the politics of nice and utterly utopian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan instead wanted to woo the &ldquo;Humphrey Catholics�? and the &ldquo;Wallace Protestants.�? He was convinced that either group could take Nixon over the top, and that both groups together could give him a landslide. Judging from early poll results, Mr. Buchanan figured that Wallace could get 12 million votes. Peeling away 8 percent of those votes was the equivalent of getting 20 percent more black voters-highly improbable-or increasing the tally of Jewish votes by 60 points, which was impossible. The choice was obvious, but Mr. Buchanan had to fight for his position. His overall advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>I urged Nixon to treat Wallace with the respect the press denied him. If asked, &#8216;Mr. Nixon: Do you consider Wallace a racist?&rsquo; I told Nixon he should reply, &#8216;Governor Wallace, by his own admission, believes in segregation and I oppose segregation.&rsquo; Not calling Wallace vile name and treating him with decency would make Nixon more acceptable to Wallace voters when they abandoned his candidacy to choose Nixon or Humphrey. Moreover, it was the right thing to do. We did not know what was in George Wallace&rsquo;s heart. Years later, I came to know and regard the governor as a friend.</p></blockquote>
<p>In these hysterical times, it takes a brave man to say that he considered George Wallace a friend.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there were plenty of people in the press who thought anything short of blasting Wallace with the fires of hell was a sign of bigotry, but Nixon continued to treat Wallace with respect. As Mr. Buchanan notes, the press kept to its usual biases. It looked the other way when Humphrey cozied up to Lester Maddox, the segregationist Democrat governor of Georgia, who had kept blacks out of his restaurant by brandishing a pick handle. Walking arm in arm with Maddox, Humphrey said, &ldquo;I am happy to be in the presence of a good Democrat,�? adding, &ldquo;The Democratic Party is like a big house. There&rsquo;s room for all of us.�?</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan agrees with the general assessment that Wallace was badly hurt by his choice of running mate, General Curtis LeMay. LeMay had run the B-29 bombing campaign against the Japanese, and when Wallace first introduced him to the press, a reporter asked if LeMay would use nuclear weapons in Vietnam. LeMay left no doubt that he thought it was a good idea, and Wallace had to step in to stop LeMay going any further. For the rest of the campaign, Wallace had to dodge shots aimed at &ldquo;Bombs Away�? LeMay.</p>
<p>This was a lucky break for Humphrey, whose party convention had been a nightmare. In that way activists have of hating people who are politically close to them more than they hate outright opponents, 10,000 hippies, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_International_Party">Yippies</a>, anarchists, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_a_Democratic_Society">SDS</a> supporters gathered in Chicago for the convention, determined to stop Humphrey. They were furious because they thought that as vice president, he had helped Johnson drag the country into the Vietnam War. They filled Grant Park, where they chanted &ldquo;Dump the Hump,�? and shouted obscenities at the police, who eventually lost patience and attacked the demonstrators for 17 violent minutes in what became known as the Chicago &ldquo;police riot.�?</p>
<p>The riot and the open warfare within his party set the Humphrey campaign off to a terrible start, but Mr. Buchanan admires the grace and persistence with which &ldquo;the happy warrior�? fought back to a near draw. Humphrey moved left, promised to end the war in Vietnam, and picked up a good number of the people who had wanted to dump him. And, as later analysis of news coverage confirmed, he was helped by a national press that backed him overwhelmingly.</p>
<p>In the end, Wallace got only 13.5 percent of the vote, though he won five states, all in the South. Nixon barely nudged out Humphrey-43.4 percent to 42.7 percent-and managed to keep the election out of the House of Representatives. The divided election was a sign of divided times; Nixon&rsquo;s limousine was pelted with rubbish as he rolled down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House after his inauguration.</p>
<p><strong>Spiro Agnew</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan offers other interesting glimpses of the times. Nixon&rsquo;s running mate, Spiro Agnew, was later caught in a bribery scandal and became the first vice president in American history to resign, and was generally seen as a gaff-prone liability. Why did Nixon choose him?</p>
<p>Agnew was governor of Maryland in 1968, when Baltimore suffered a week-long black riot after King was assassinated. Agnew called in federal troops to help restore order and then invited 100 black leaders to a televised meeting before the press corps. He excoriated them for not denouncing the black radical, Stokely Carmichael, who had been stirring up trouble. Not one black leader, he pointed out, had said a word when a Carmichael lieutenant called the Baltimore police &ldquo;the enemy of the black community.�? Agnew had learned of a secret meeting with Carmichael, in which there had been an agreement that no black would publicly criticize another black, no matter what he said. Agnew called this a &ldquo;perverted sense of race loyalty.�? Many blacks walked out and white liberals screeched, but Nixon admired Agnew&rsquo;s toughness. Mr. Buchanan says the Baltimore speech was &ldquo;a major factor�? in Nixon&rsquo;s choice of VP. In another admission that will win him no friends, Mr. Buchanan adds that he liked and always got on well with Agnew.</p>
<p>There are other bits of lore. In 1963, even before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the federal Fair Housing Act of 1968, the California state legislature had passed a law forbidding landlords or homeowners from racial discrimination in rentals or sales. The California Real Estate Association thought this was a violation of private property rights, and it got one million signatures-twice the number needed-for a ballot initiative to overturn the law. The initiative won with a resounding 65 percent of the vote, but the California Supreme Court struck it down on the novel theory that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>When Ronald Reagan ran for governor of California in 1966, he promised to repeal the law and let Californians rent or sell to whomever they liked. He never got the chance; the US Supreme Court upheld the Californian Court&rsquo;s rejection of the ballot initiative. Still, it is interesting to note that the man whose name is on Washington Reagan Airport campaigned for freedom of association.</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan does not have much admiration for Robert Kennedy, who jumped into the race for the Democratic nomination only after Senator Eugene McCarthy&rsquo;s shoestring-budget New Hampshire campaign had shown that Lyndon Johnson was vulnerable. (Johnson was so demoralized by the war and by dissent in his own party that he later declared he would not run for reelection). Mr. Buchanan notes that when Robert Kennedy had been attorney general for his brother John, he had authorized wiretaps on Martin Luther King. By 1968, however, King was a martyr, and Robert denied knowing anything about the wiretaps. A furious J. Edgar Hoover called that &ldquo;absolutely inconceivable.�?</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan is obviously master of his material in this book, but he draws a strange conclusion from the chaos of the Chicago Democratic convention. He calls it &ldquo;a crisis of liberalism�? and proof that &ldquo;liberalism was being rejected as a failed ideology. It had been tried and found wanting.�?</p>
<p>If only that were true. Nixon and Reagan briefly slowed the march of some elements of liberalism, but it has been the crushingly dominant ideology of the last 50 years. It does now have a slightly different flavor: It has lost its tincture of revolutionary Marxism, and few college students hang pictures of Che Guevara in their dorms. But it is hard to think of a single change in American society that the mob in Grant Park would not have approved: forced integration, race preferences, multi-culturalism, white-shaming, homosexual marriage, de facto amnesty for illegals, campus speech codes, women in combat, &ldquo;medical�? marijuana. Workers have not seized the means of production and it is still possible to become a billionaire, but otherwise today&rsquo;s America is a revolutionary&rsquo;s dream come true.</p>
<p><strong>The comeback goes bad</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan gives Nixon very high marks for his first term in office, and believes that if he had vanished in 1973 he would be remembered as a great or near-great President. Indeed, he was reelected in 1972 with an overwhelming 62 percent of the vote, and won 49 states. And yet, of course, he was destroyed by the Watergate scandal, and became the only president ever to resign. The clouds of disgrace never entirely parted over his later years.</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan was by Nixon&rsquo;s side up until the moment he helicoptered off the South Lawn for the last time. &ldquo;All that,�? he writes, &ldquo;is the subject, the Lord willing, of another book.�? <em>The Greatest Comeback</em> is a unique insider&rsquo;s view of an important part of American history. Let us hope the Lord is willing.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-577966" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s first job out of journalism school was an assistant editorial page editor for the <i>St. Louis Globe-Democrat</i>. The editor-in-chief of the paper at the time, Martin Duggan, would later be the lead moderator of the local political roundtable weekly show on public television, <i>Donnybrook</i>. And Nixon recruited PJB directly away from the <i>Globe</i>.</p>
<p>The real secret weapon that helped Nixon nuance the &#8220;frienemy&#8221; threat from George Wallace in 1968 was Strom Thurmond. Four years prior, Thurmond changed parties (the only real &#8220;Dixiecrat&#8221; to change parties, incidentally), and by 1968, he forgot all about segregation and turned into a Republican establishment hack. Thurmond went all over the two Carolinas promising people that Nixon was as good as Wallace and could win. That was just enough to swing NC and SC from Wallace to Nixon in the electoral college, and put Nixon over 270. Otherwise, no candidate would have gotten to 270, it would have gone to the House, and Wallace could have been the king maker. Ironically, 20 years before, that&rsquo;s what Strom Thurmond himself set out to do when he ran for President as an unofficial Democrat, deadlock the EC.</p>
<p>In reality, after Nixon got into the White House, he set out to try to ruin Wallace, because he did not want Wallace running again in 1972 as an independent to repeat the headace of 1968. What Nixon wanted of Wallace was to run as a Democrat, because Nixon probably rightly assumed that the Democrat Party had gone so far left that there&rsquo;s no way Wallace could have won the Democrat nomination. Unfortunately, the actions of Arthur Bremer prevented that theory from being tested in the real world.</p>
<p>And also&hellip;PJB is at his absolute worst when he gets into Nixon apologetics. And PJB doesn&rsquo;t do much bad.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-578835" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Rubbish.</p>
<p>Unions don&rsquo;t exist because they give the proletariat a way to feel like they have a way to compensate for their lack of power as social ability. Depending on whom you believe, the rise of unions was either -always- a tool to be used and discarded or the left has learned (finally) that the workers will be quite content to be lazy, fat, politically indolent, bastards, &#8216;useless to the cause&rsquo;, because the game&rsquo;s on and Jimmy brought beer.</p>
<p>Rather than play the left&rsquo;s game, the capital class simply shut the doors on the factories and moved them to East Asian and Central America and now there are no good jobs at all, while rising income inequality, coming soon huge taxation increases inherent to debt and social welfare paid out to immigrants by a shrinking middle class will bring them to the side of the left, &#8216;at last&rsquo; (gasp of our country) to overthrow the capitalist moneyed elite who will be given power to be scapegoated into &#8216;change&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In this, you must see that it&rsquo;s a power struggle in which despoilment is the key to gaining allies after the -combined- efforts of &#8216;moderate&rsquo; politics makes capitalism look so rawly evil that there is no one left but the left.</p>
<p>If conservative economics (formerly known as mercantilism) were actually being practiced, a lack of backing for the unions would mean that industry would remain inside the U.S. rather than being scattered to the four winds where it is effectively beyond the control of the wealthy who profit from it only so long as the U.S. itself exists to force payment from places like China.</p>
<p>What the left doesn&rsquo;t realize is that the world is just as greedy as the elitist, centrist, classist devils they plan to slow cook here. And thus the end of wealth based capital economics _here_ (as the military power to enforce it) will mean it&rsquo;s rise /elsewhere/, when foreign interests realize they don&rsquo;t have to pay their moneyed elite in a non-country undergoing revolution a damn thing.</p>
<p>Nor will the left be able to export their madness because those whose see what the left are doing in this country will realize that, to survive with their new found money (and populations much more usd to submissive-to-hierarchy behavior), they have to have to STOP the process of- </p>
<p>Demoralize,</p>
<p>Destabilize,</p>
<p>Crisis,</p>
<p>(re)Normalization.</p>
<p>Interdict any one of these steps by _controlling who can speak_ to your nations weak and young and foolish and you can avoid the decay of social trust into revolution which is what the left is deliberately seeking here.</p>
<p>Places like China and Russia already have such controls in place and thus remain, relatively, stable as growth driven economic states.</p>
<p>The left are so obsessed with their quest for ultimate power as &#8216;their way&rsquo; and see the destruction of the right as the obstacle to their perfect world that they will use any method to win.</p>
<p>But they never look in the mirror to see the face of the person that everyone else will see when they topple the U.S. into anarchy and get the mob to follow them.</p>
<p>Desperation is not ability or choice, it is instinct. And when the left have their revolution, they will create such massive destruction in the release of stupid instinct on the part of the lowest classes that every nation will flee into the embrace of elitist classism to protect them from the meltdown that they will get to see happening here.</p>
<p>The left are destroying our nation for nothing.</p>

<p>The question is how to do it wisely - without creating a sluggardly, entitled thinking pack of eternal adolescents. And without robbing Whitey to pay our enemies or potential enemies.</p>

Dying for a cause that needed accomplishing was an acceptable, if harsh, fate for families that still had 2-3-4 other children to invest in.<br/>
These were the sons and daughters of WWII vets who had that sense of honor passed onto them.<br/>
What the left did, when they used baby killer and &#8216;you deserve to die!&rsquo; shaming psychology was strip the rightness of the cause as an ideal to cling to so that the nation&rsquo;s sense of self-integrity could be shattered.<br/>
What is left of that nation, today, thinks only of itself and has no belief in the notion of national ideals and objectives worth dying for. Thus the whole concept that &#8216;your son doesn&rsquo;t deserve to die&rsquo; is actually proof of the collapsed ego and shrunken abuse victim psychology by which every person is reduced to individualism rather than having any group identity with which to associate.<br/>
It is the torturers kind hand up after the vicious whipping of a completely debilitated, effeminized, American population.<br/>
But the words you hear today would not have worked in 1968 because the evil of the left&rsquo;s Agenda had not yet had it&rsquo;s way with 2 generations of losers conned into thinking they didn&rsquo;t deserve to win.</p>

He would never have let this happen - it would never have progressed to the point where it is now. I had my 80 year old mother here today arguing with me that &#8220;NOBODY should be shot dead by police unless they are shooting at them&#8221; even after I showed her poor innocent little black boy Michael Thug Brown menacing the daylights out of the little Hindu store owner. What can you do with her? She&rsquo;s my mom, so I can&rsquo;t pound her head in like I&rsquo;d like to and call her a DWL. That photo of that thug alone merits a removal from society in my view - sorry but I just don&rsquo;t see any real value in such a person. So honestly, if Wallace had been elected the savages would never have run amok seeking revenge on whites. They wouldn&rsquo;t be learning the lies that make them think we owe them anything. It boggles the mind that after seeing what he was up to, the negroes are rioting with not an iota of shame that the man who was shot was committing a crime (probably one of many) - it doesn&rsquo;t even seem to register.</p>

<p>The black ghetto riots and the rise in crime turned white moderates into Republicans. </p>
<p>Because the average standard of living had been increasing fairly steadily since the inauguration of Franklin Roosevelt in 1933, capitalism seemed to be working. Because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the War on Poverty was followed by a rise in crime and the black ghetto riots, liberalism did not seem to be working.</p>
<p>The disruptive behavior of many anti war demonstrators angered many Americans who were unenthusiastic about the War in Vietnam, and caused them to vote for hawks, who prolonged the war effort.</p>

<p>On previous occasions I have documented that from 1921 to 2000 the per capita gross domestic product has grown over twice as much under Democratic presidents than Republican presidents, that from the presidencies of Harry Truman to that of George W. Bush there have almost always been more jobs created per year under Democratic presidents as under Republican presidents, and that since 1900 the stock market has grown over twice as much under Democrat presidents. </p>
<p>I have always disliked the sexual revolution, which most liberals have liked, but that has not really been a political issue.</p>

The Carter years in particular were a disaster: inflation, high unemployment, high interest rates etc. His economic policies are widely accept as disastrous except in the minds of wacko liberals.That is why he was a one-term president.</p>
<p>On previous occasions I have also told you not to throw cherry-picked statistics at me. All it convinces me of is your ability to sift through haystacks and find a needle here and there that you think persuades an argument or makes your point.</p>
<p>I lived through that period, I don&rsquo;t need a pie chart or a single statistic to convince me that they were glorious years.</p>
<p>All presidents do good and bad on economic issues because they are so complex and symbiotic. Don&rsquo;t try to convince me that Democrats and Democrats only are economic geniuses.</p>
<p>Modern day liberals are also wrong about diversity, entitlements, immigration, education, healthcare, foreign policy, energy, the justice system, international affairs, Israel, and our military to name but a few.</p>

The New Left was the result of indoctrination in college and by various books published in the 40s ( numero uno &#8220;The Authoritarian Personality&#8221;), which diagnosed being a Euro-American Christian in itself as pathological.</p>

It split an entire generation from teaching it&rsquo;s youth to reject radicalism as the actions of the hormonally foolish. And left an abiding rebellion and anger in a whole generation who turned their 1960s rejection and powerlessness into 1970s and 1980s voting habits retribution.<br/>
You recall your time in that world with some kind of golden glow nostalgia in immediate terms rather than 20-50 year eventualities sir.<br/>
The slapped down, spoiled, children of the 60s have spent their entire majority getting pay back by refusing to acknowledge the purpose of nationalism in a competitive world and seeking to embrace other weak people like they _still_ feel themselves to be, with uncontrolled immigration and blanket social welfare programs whole &#8216;liberal&rsquo; ideals have since become the inheritance of their own children, irrespective of the real world consequences that are now so obvious that to ignore them can only be possible through delusion.<br/>
All because &#8216;certain groups&rsquo; made sure there was never any wisdom to impart from the parents to the children in that decade and for that war.<br/>
This is what your &#8216;sixties social revolution&rsquo; did.<br/>
And it&rsquo;s a fools quest to think that ANYTHING that has happened since has been more than the liberal left continuing down a dark path seeking more and more dependent power from society as a whole, rather than admit that they were wrong to begin with.<br/>
Vietnam is a mirror image of California. It is a stopper on the Asian landmass and an easy control point for keeping Chinese maritime trade under constant watch. That is _all_ that Vietnam ever was. And when the dollar collapses when China gets oil overland and uncouples the RMB from the USD and we lack the geo-strategic positioning to be a real naval threat to her imports, it will be the fault of a bunch of moronic fool teenagers from the 60s who started the process towards U.S. national implosion.<br/>
No more latte`, no more IPhone, no more power, water, internet.<br/>
This is the consequence of liberal idealism substituting for the realities of nationalist economics.<br/>
And the simple fact that these 60s genius rebels without a cause couldn&rsquo;t look at a globe and see what was coming, especially after Nixon&rsquo;s trip, makes them totally worthless as &#8216;paragons of peace&rsquo;.<br/>
Nothing like a retired zealot trying to remember when he wasn&rsquo;t a hero, to make the current mess all the more insoluable.</p>

I knew a lady who made over 40,000 dollars a year over 20 years ago. For a single income, this put her in the top 10%, but she still imagined she was poor. 20 plus years later, rising up the ladder, she still feels she&rsquo;s one of the poor people.

<p>That five dollars is not a reward, nor am I oppressing you, it is payment for a service which was voluntarily agreed upon, whether it&rsquo;s $5 or $5,000,000, if it was freely given to me it&rsquo;s mine and you have no right to it, if you say you do that is called stealing, which the Bible is most certainly against.</p>

But the fact that Nixon felt that he couldn&rsquo;t get closer to Wallace, shows one of two things: either Nixon was the RINO some people accuse him of being (EPA and race quotas don&rsquo;t look good); or he was a skilled politician who observed that Euro-Americans were already doomed to subordination to other-Americans. Just as I infer from the Commenter&rsquo;s words, at least 1968 would have been a much better time to make a stand than today. I can&rsquo;t say for sure, but, in 1968, Euro-Americans were still 80-85% of the population. Is it believable that things were already beyond our control? 1968 was my first vote in a Presidential Election, and I voted for Wallace. I would today, for the Wallace of 1968. He was on my side and said he was on my side, and he&rsquo;s the last national politician who&rsquo;s given me that impression.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-581376" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Let&rsquo;s tell the truth about Nixon. He, not Johnson was the affirmative action President. In 1970 by executive order he invented the hispanic race entitled to affirmative action by executive order to the census bureau. He invented section 8 as a way to preserve property taxes (vast sections of cities had buildings worth $1.00) School busing was EXPANDED under Nixon.<br/>
He EXPANDED Johnson&rsquo;s war on poverty programs. Those programs employed the likes of Bill Ayers, Kathy Boudin, Bernadine Dohrn and other weather underground and black panthers. Of course Ayers et al were on the run and using fake names, but the people who ran the War on Poverty programs that employed them knew exactly who they were.</p>
<p>Face it folks, Nixon was a complete tool of the Rockefellers and Kissinger was his minder.<br/>
He won a landlside. And what did he do? Section 8, affirmative action, and worst of all he allowed the endless war on poverty programs to continue their subversion.</p>
<p>I know all about it, I was there and knew Dorhn and Ayers when they worked on a San Francisco legal aid program under false names. While she was getting a federal paycheck Dorhn planted the bomb at SF&rsquo;sPark Police Station that killed one and blinded another White Police Officer.</p>
<p>As I told my girl friends about men, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t listen to what they say, watch what they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nixon&rsquo;s was the most dangerous administration to Whites in the 20th century. He was a Rockefeller stooge.</p>

This is of course the major middle class federal tax deduction. It is also a major reason for buying instead of renting. So the real estate people as well as homeowners also voted for Nixon as well as putting in a lot of money against McGovern.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-581393" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Fine review. Recalling that time, I doubt that Americans were &#8220;terrified&#8221; by the Tet Offensive. Many saw it as the last straw in proving that the U.S. should stop pouring countless young lives into that endless meat grinder. Of course there are military experts who still maintain that the North Vietnamese lost the Tet Offensive, but that debate will go on forever. For one thing, if an offensive is a huge psychological victory, can it still be said to be a defeat?</p>

Nixon and Reagan briefly slowed the march of some elements of liberalism, but it has been the crushingly dominant ideology of the last 50 years. It does now have a slightly different flavor: It has lost its tincture of revolutionary Marxism, and few college students hang pictures of Che Guevara in their dorms. But it is hard to think of a single change in American society that the mob in Grant Park would not have approved: forced integration, race preferences, multi-culturalism, white-shaming, homosexual marriage, de facto amnesty for illegals, campus speech codes, women in combat, &ldquo;medical�? marijuana. Workers have not seized the means of production and it is still possible to become a billionaire, but otherwise today&rsquo;s America is a revolutionary&rsquo;s dream come true.</i> </p>
<p>A great summary of exactly where this country is today. That the Repubs do not see the last half century as exactly what it is, a series of embarrassing, crushing defeats for their party, shows that they really only care about that last part: that in the US today it is still possible for a tiny few to become billionaires.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not believe any of this. These men and women likely hold many of the same views as those who post here and other similar sites. Unfortunately, they are much more comfortable backing positions that will enable them to absorb wealth and maintain power bases, than they are advocating for personal principles. Never forget that all of these politicians live in nearly 100% white areas and likely exhibit personal behaviors that mirror our own. They are not blind to the current state of world affairs. They simply choose to ignore it for the sake of personal gain and the fear of personal loss. </p>
<p>The willingness to exhibit any shred of fortitude&hellip;any hint of principle or morals&hellip;seemingly has been lost. No one, myself included to a point, is willing to sacrifice themselves at the altar of political incorrectness. Very few are willing to lose a dime or absorb a negative criticism. Whether we call it fear, or simply weakness in our cultural fabric, the results are clear. This nation is quickly slipping into a state that even our historical enemies never regressed to.</p>
