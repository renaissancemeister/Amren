<h1 class="title">The European Elections</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Adrian Davies, American Renaissance, May 27, 2014</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
A promising shift to the Right.</div> 
</div> 



<p>The results of elections to the so-called European Parliament show that the peoples of our mother continent are at long last showing signs of resistance to-indeed, incipient revolt against-the cosmopolitan elites that have for so long misruled them.</p>
<p>Across the European Union, populist, rightist and anti-establishment parties have scored remarkably well, though the outcomes vary significantly from country to country. The EU has a <a href="http://www.results-elections2014.eu/en/election-results-2014.html">website</a> that gives the results for each country, both for this year and for the previous election in 2009.</p>
<p>Speaking in the most general terms, it is possible to identify two broad families of ideas among the insurgent parties. The first is essentially our own. With marked differences of emphasis, the parties of this tendency broadly agree that while a shared language, culture, and religion are important, a nation is in essence a kin group or extended family. I will call this current of thought &ldquo;identitarian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second is essentially libertarian in inspiration. It is concerned about individual rights and economic freedoms, not group interests or national identity. Americans will recognize this kind of &ldquo;rightist&rdquo; party all too well.</p>
<p>By far the most important breakthrough for the identitarian tendency is the stunning success of the Front National in France. It has polled over 25 percent of the popular vote, some 4 percent more than the fractious establishment conservative UMP party, and is now the largest party in France in terms of electoral support. It will take 24 seats in the European Parliament, up from only three from the previous election.</p>
<p>Both the FN and the UMP massively out-polled the ruling Socialist party, which managed only 11 percent of the votes. The panic stricken, inept, calamitous President Hollande called the results &ldquo;a shock, an earthquake.&rdquo; He now proposes to address the nation, presumably to beg the French people to stop voting outside the box.</p>
<p>Our state broadcaster, the BBC, has published a remarkably objective <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-eu-27577964">analysis</a> of the FN&rsquo;s triumph, which is well worth reading. This magnificent result is a tribute to Marine Le Pen&rsquo;s inspired leadership. While some hard-line elements in French nationalist circles have criticized her for trimming, it is surely better to make some compromises and take 25 percent of the vote than boast about ideological purity, and poll derisory votes.</p>
<p>It is also important to bear in mind that the FN&rsquo;s supposed trimming only goes so far. The FN explicitly rejects the rule of alien financial interests and dogmatic market fundamentalism, as well as supranational government and mass immigration. It also rejects the whole neo-conservative project for world domination by armed force.</p>
<p>Marine Le Pen is on excellent terms with Russian President Vladimir Putin. If the day comes when she leads France, her country will not be participating in any more wars to bring a misshapen simulacrum of democracy at the point of a gun to countries that do not conform to the neo-conservative world view.</p>
<p>The FN believes in a bigger, less tightly bound and, yes, more <em>diverse</em> Europe, extending from Portugal to the Urals, rid of past fratricidal wars but also unconstrained by a centralizing proto-government that, by riding roughshod over national sensibilities, is more likely to inflame the worst kind of nationalism than to unite Europe. Such an approach is surely worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Miss Le Pen has announced she will meet with other party leaders in the hope of establishing an official group that would have considerable powers in the Parliament. However, she <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/marine-le-pen-met-far-right-leaders-eu-bloc">ruled out</a> an alliance that would include Hungary&rsquo;s Jobbik or Greece&rsquo;s Golden Dawn (see below).</p>
<p>The FN&rsquo;s domestic prospects are very promising. Elections to the French National Assembly (equivalent to the British House of Commons and US House of Representatives) are conducted on an electoral system that has up to now proved less favorable to the FN than the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27187434">d&rsquo;Hondt</a> system used in elections to the European Parliament. Nevertheless, the ruling Socialists are caught in a dilemma: Mr. Hollande could dissolve the National Assembly and call new elections, which would mean an influx of FN deputies; or he can cling to power in defiance of the popular will, and perhaps face an even worse defeat when the term of the current deputies ends in 2017.</p>
<p>Could the FN actually take power in France? That is now a real and exciting possibility, but will not happen quite yet. This would probably require a major economic crisis in the Eurozone that finally discredited the existing political class so completely that an electoral majority could be found for radical change.</p>
<p>The European single currency, essentially part of a political project for supranational government with no underlying economic logic, has proved a strait-jacket for many countries, particularly in southern Europe. The FN is the only important party in France to call for abandoning the Euro and returning to France&rsquo;s national currency, the Franc, which would allow French exports to become more competitive by devaluing the currency. The alternative is endless wage cutting and hated austerity measures.</p>
<p>Were the Euro to collapse amidst widespread economic dislocation worse than the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, the FN might sweep to power. Such an outcome is possible, though not written in the stars.</p>
<p>In the meantime, since success breeds success, it is reasonable to expect further progress even without an existential crisis in the Eurozone, though something more than even the present wave of discontent will be necessary to transform strong nationwide support for the FN into an overall majority of the French people.</p>
<p>Another authentic identitarian party that performed well was Heinz-Christian Strache&rsquo;s Freedom Party (FPÖ), which has taken more than 20 percent of the vote in Austria, up from less than 8 percent in 2009. This doubles its representation in the European Parliament from two to four (seats are allocated to each member state according to its population, and Austria is a small country). The country is plainly leaning rightwards; the establishment conservative People&rsquo;s Party (ÖVP) out-polled the leftist Social Democrats, though its number of deputies dropped from six to five.</p>
<p>In Sweden-up to now one of the most liberal states in Europe-the anti-immigration Swedish Democrats polled just under 10 percent of the vote in a well deserved shock to the system. They will now have two seats in the EU Parliament. This is still, however, Sweden. A new party called <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/swedish-feminist-party-wins-eu-seat-anti-racism-141337419.html">Feminist Initiative</a>, to which Jane Fonda has contributed, became the first overtly &ldquo;feminist&rdquo; party to send a representative to Brussels: a 57-year-old Gypsy named Soraya Post.</p>
<p>One party that did less well than anticipated was Geert Wilders&rsquo; Freedom Party in Holland. It seems to be moving from a libertarian to a more identitarian position, but its leader has not carried all his members with him. Its vote is down from about 17 percent to about 14 percent, which is a small decline, but contrary to the way in which the tide is running across Europe. It will send only three rather than four deputies to the European Parliament. Mr. Wilders&rsquo; opponents attribute the setback on his <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10852737/EU-elections-2014-toxic-Marine-Le-Pen-blamed-for-Geert-Wilders-defeat.html">open embrace</a> of Marine Le Pen and the Front National.</p>
<p>Another disappointment was the Vlaams Belang in Belgium, which at one point was one of the <a href="/news/2011/07/european_nation.html">leaders </a>of European identitarianism. It&rsquo;s score dropped from 9.9 to 4.1 percent, and it now has only one representative in Brussels. Much of its support has gone to the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), which combines demands for Flemish independence with a deliberately softer touch on immigration and identity. Its percentage of the vote went from 6.1 to 16.3, making it the top vote-getter in Belgium.</p>
<p>In Hungary, the nationalist Jobbik party had a very good election, taking second place with 14.7 percent, after the ruling conservative Fidesz party, and bumping the Hungarian Socialist Party back to third place. Fidesz itself has been criticized by the usual suspects for excessive nationalism, but is unlikely to care, since it took a remarkable 52 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>In Greece, Golden Dawn, a party whose strident rhetoric and &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; imagery have not in my view been wise, showed surprising sense by putting forward very high caliber candidates, including distinguished retired army officers. They polled well. Three representatives of Golden Dawn will take their seats in the new parliament, as the party took 9.4 percent of the vote. It surged into third place, pulling past the long-dominant PASOK (Panhellenic Socialist Party-going by the name of &ldquo;Olive Tree&rdquo; in this election). This is an extraordinary achievement. One can only hope that Golden Dawn will learn the appropriate lessons about presentation, without betraying its core ideals.</p>
<p>Popular dissatisfaction in Greece also went the other way, with the hard-left Syriza party improving its performance more than five fold from 2009, and coming in first place with 26.6 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Turning now to the libertarian tendency, the United Kingdom Independence Party has been the big winner in Great Britain. It has handsomely topped the poll, taking votes from the ruling Conservative Party, the Conservatives&rsquo; coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, the opposition Labour Party, and also the British National Party, which suffered complete electoral collapse and the loss of its two seats in the European Parliament. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27571451">Here</a> is a quite objective account by the BBC about the BNP debacle.</p>
<p>The BNP&rsquo;s vote plummeted from 943,598 votes or 6.3 percent in 2009 to 179,694 or 1.1 percent in 2014, while UKIP&rsquo;s vote soared from an already high 2,498,226 or 16.5 percent and second place nationally in 2009, to 4,352,051 or 27.5 percent and first place nationally.</p>
<p>UKIP is a strange, ideologically incoherent amalgam of free market enthusiasts, libertarians, social conservatives and crypto-identitarians, whose leader, Nigel Farage, is a charismatic speaker, much attended by controversy of every kind, personal and political. Perhaps the starkest example of UKIP&rsquo;s lack of ideological cohesion is that it polls best in elections to the parliament of the European Union, while advocating withdrawal from that union. It also &ldquo;faces both ways&rdquo; on immigration.</p>
<p>UKIP vehemently repudiates any suggestion that nationality is rooted in ethnicity, and advocates the ludicrous idea of the proposition nation, which has no historical antecedents in European political thought, except perhaps in the Soviet Union, which is not exactly a happy precedent.</p>
<p>At any rate UKIP <em>did</em> advocate a colorblind immigration policy until a few days before the election, when a &ldquo;tired&rdquo; Nigel Farage mused in public about why he would be more reluctant to have Romanians for neighbors than Germans, perhaps an example of <em>in vino veritas</em>, or on the other hand of &ldquo;I am their leader, so I must follow them,&rdquo; or &ldquo;worse&rdquo; still, a confusion between Romanians and Roma gypsies, which would have been even more shocking to the<em> bien-pensant</em>!</p>
<p>Establishment commentators have been quick to pretend that UKIP&rsquo;s appropriation of the BNP vote shows a considered rejection of the politics of identity.</p>
<p>An especially striking example is this gem from the supposedly conservative <em>Spectator</em> columnist Fraser Nelson:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amidst all the fuss tonight, we may miss a wonderful moment: the destruction of the BNP. The last Euro elections were the high point for British neo-fascism, with the BNP winning almost a million votes-far more support than the National Front or Oswald Mosley mob ever managed. For five years the BNP have been parliamentarians with seats and, <em>ergo, </em>the right to appear on &ldquo;Question Time.&rdquo; They did well not because voters shared its racist agenda, but because voting BNP seemed to be the best way of throwing a stone on the Westminster greenhouse. No longer. UKIP has given a non-racist, anti-establishment alternative. For this and other reasons the BNP is in meltdown tonight, the odious Nick Griffin has accepted that he has lost his European Parliament seat and the party is being buried because it has tried to hawk racism in the most tolerant country on earth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, er, no. The reasons why the BNP has been buried are in part that UKIP now &ldquo;hawks racism&rdquo; (that is to say, voices the concerns of ordinary people outside the loathsome metropolitan politico-media class of which Mr. Nelson is a representative-people who don&rsquo;t want their country transformed into part of the third world) in a prettier package than the BNP. The moral of this story is never, ever underestimate the importance of branding and presentation in politics.</p>
<p>But even more fundamentally the BNP chairman Nick Griffin has long practiced the political equivalent of slash and burn agriculture, failing to understand that successful challenger parties must sink deep local roots and undermine the edifice of two party system politics by picking away at its foundations in local government. Instead Griffin grandstanded on national television with disastrous results, while marginalizing, undermining and in the last resort purging perceived potential rivals in his own party rather than building a winning team. Now he has paid the price of his failures of leadership, vision, and even moral character. The many good patriots whom he has led astray over the long years of his undeserved predominance will shed no tears at his undoing.</p>
<p>How the UKIP phenomenon will play out is not foreseeable. It might evolve into a broadly based populist party of the Right, articulating the legitimate fears and concerns of the British people, or it might cozy up closer to the system parties, seeking an arrangement with the ruling Conservatives, whose coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, lost ten of their eleven European seats and are on their way out of government.</p>
<p>Anyone who witnessed, as I did, the hilarious ravings of Conservative Members of the European Parliament-including the supposedly &ldquo;right wing&rdquo; Daniel Hannam (personally close to UKIP leader Nigel Farage)-against the Front National will realize that there is no more hope for &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; conservatism in England than from the Republican Party in the United States. Only time will tell which path UKIP takes.</p>
<p>Moreover, UKIP has been a major beneficiary of the electoral system for elections to the European Parliament, which allows roughly proportional representation, whereas elections to our national parliament next year will take place on the &ldquo;first past the post&rdquo; system that is unfavorable to parties such as UKIP, which has a high but quite evenly distributed level of support. The &ldquo;first past the post&rdquo; system favors parties whose support is concentrated in key constituencies (our equivalent of Congressional districts), so that next year the Liberal Democrats might well win many more seats with some 8 percent of the vote than UKIP with twice that share.</p>
<p>Finally, turnout in these elections has been low across Europe. It will more or less double in elections to the British parliament at Westminster next year, with unpredictable results. We are in unknown territory.</p>
<p>In Germany, there is no credible nationalist party, only a miasma of fractious, feuding groupuscules, heavily infiltrated by state <em>agents provocateurs. </em>Here we saw another example of a libertarian breakthrough, however, with the Alternative for Germany<em> </em>winning 7 percent of the vote and sending representatives to Brussels for the first time. It is desperately making politically correct noises about non-cooperation with any identitarian parties.</p>
<p>In Denmark, the anti-immigration Danish People&rsquo;s Party came in first with a hugely impressive 27 percent, but seeks to sidle up to our repellent Conservatives, while distancing itself from UKIP, let alone genuine nationalist parties.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by no means all good news from Europe. There are few encouraging signs from Spain or Portugal, and Italian politics are mired in personality related issues. Some parties of the far Left have done well in these countries, while in countries such as Poland, where the economy is performing relatively well, the parties of the <em>status quo </em>have had their successes. Overall, however, we are perhaps seeing the first rays of a new dawn after a long night.</p>

<p>The ridiculous American anti France propaganda that &#8220;The French don&rsquo;t fight&#8221; pure nonsense. Yeah, the French don&rsquo;t like to fight other good White European people&rsquo;s like the Germans or the Russians. The French didn&rsquo;t waste the 1980s funding Mountain Muslim Goat $&$& Jihadists in Afghanistan like idiot American Reagan Conservatives !</p>
<p>French White military kicked arse in Algeria, they still do the same in Black Africa, no debacles like US in Somalia.</p>
<p>Like the Russians, French have a practical, effective, non hateful way of addressing the power of the tribe - not obsessive, but Neo a cons with the exception of Sarkozy ain&rsquo;t running things in France or Russia. Real French and a Russian people detest Hollywood.</p>

First off, Reagan conservatives were the only option against the total failure of the Carter Dumb-o-craps, and while Reagan had his flaws, he gave back a sense of PRIDE in America, that has been in eclipse, ever since Bush I/Clinton/Bush II/Obummer.</p>
<p>Secondly, France has made it clear, it wants to priss and preen (a woman won, after all!) pretending to be &#8216;nationalist&rsquo; when the &#8216;girly Le Pen&rsquo; has quite clearly said, it wants NOTHING to do with either Golden Dawn or Jobbik, the only two parties with some cojones in this fight. Why not? What do you fear, Marine? A return to de Gaulle, and a France that was worthy of the name, France?</p>
<p>Lastly, the pusillanimous English are acting like nancy-boys, with their fear of appearing &#8216;racist.&rsquo; My God, what is WRONG with Europe. The Muslim birthrate in all countries of Europe, GUARANTEES a Jihadist state in less than a generation, and the GENOCIDE of the White Race, for crying out loud? </p>
<p>Dear Lord, give us men like St. Olav, Charlemagne, King Arthur, and even a King Richard the Lionheart, whose concern was for their race, and their people, and not their 401k, or their ego!</p>

The inspiration and Return of Arthur in fact (Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall) and in &#8220;myth&#8221; (Layamon, Tennyson, Clemence Dane, &c) will appear in a book soon to be finished for English youth. The Old Ones are stirring and the Young Ones are awakening. You can begin to feel a change in the air   &mdash;   at long last.</p>

<p>I recently came across the following at the end of a Quatermass novel by Nigel Kneale after a breakdown of Britain: &#8220;&hellip;it gladdened him to see England again, a recovering land with its soft green fields and quiet towns. Little children could play in safety and sing, as they had done for centuries, their innocent old nursery rhymes.&#8221; Guess when it was published? 1979 - as &#8220;recently&#8221; as that!</p>

Taxes increased under Reagan himself, then Bush, then Clinton. Not one federal agency, department, or administration was eliminated, even though the Ed Dept was recently independent from HEW, and the Energy Dept was new. I was working in the brand-new Forrestal Bldg when Jimmah threw the Army out and gave it to DoE in &rsquo;78. On moral issues, Reagan was as worthless as anybody who spent 40 years living in Hollyweird would be. Our last decent Prez was Andy Jackson, who knew the differences between whites and non-whites, and exactly what to do about them. I am aware of not one GOP pol today who would admit publicly that even one tiny difference exists, and to talk about necessary action   &mdash;   get the fainting couch!!!!</p>

LBJ, Carter, and Clinton were all as dedicated to staffing the bureaucracy with far-Leftists as O&rsquo;bwana is. Reagan was a fiscal Conservative but a moral relativist. Spending his adult life in the moral cesspool that is Hollywood guarantees that. Whatever righteous antagonism Reagan may (or may not) have felt towards Leftists, he never proposed any effective actions to cripple or eliminate them. I must say that this is the reason why Leftism must not be tolerated. It affects ordinary people upon prolonged exposure. Leftists must not be allowed to live here.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that interesting? First, to be allowed to post for so long and then to do so politely and receive such a large number of upvotes? And KUDOS to those Amren posters who &#8220;went there&#8221;. </p>

The pattern happened over and over. The BNP would make a breakthrough in local council elections and then Griffin would get into some kind of feud with the party leaders in that area that would result in them leaving the party. This happened until there were no more local operations that were winning elections. </p>
<p>There were also other fiascos. Griffin blew his big chance on TV by trying to suck up to the people who were attacking him and not acting like a man. That was really the turning point. He seemed to be surprised at the hostile reception he was getting and just grinned sheepishly while being insulted. I think it was some kind of misguided attempt to come across as moderate.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-524601" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What about American meddling in Europe after World War II? Weren&rsquo;t we there propping up the same world system Woodrow Wilson proposed? The one that has bled us for 70 years now and deprived our British and European counterparts of the ability to define their own identity and see the need for keeping boundaries between themselves and the other. Stalinism was brutal, that is true. But no one has asked that basic question: Would Europe have been better off under a strong hand? And if so, if not under Nazism, then what other strong hand was there, except the hand of Stalin?</p>
<p>That, in my mind, is a serious question. Nazism, in my mind, was not an acceptable alternative. If a cure was needed for the endemic problems of European civilization, what was it? And did we, by investing in maintaining something that perhaps was not threatened anyway, republican democracy and constitutional monarchy, harm both Europe and ourselves?

We have been hated for decenia, and actually, we have suffered a lot from all the propaganda that has been made against us. Just a quick apology would certainly be appreciated by us Germans. Our ego hasn&rsquo;t really been fed for a long time, seriously. We are practically seen and described as cultural Nazis. An apology can also awaken many of us Germans. It might help us to realise our common European interests. I think that an apology is actually a good idea. Apologies and comradery are not mutually exclusive, but endless apologies are not needed. Germans are not Blacks. If our German self-esteem is boosted, we can do great things, unlike those who come out of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p>Those &#8220;not to be named&#8221; are of two sorts: the ones who have a problem with all Europeans, and those who&rsquo;ve shifted to a more Near Eastern frame of mind. Both sorts have moved on from Germany as Germany. Anyway some of us view the former as apostates and as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, you can have &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>I would, if I were European, worry most about the most aggressive nations with the highest population density. In Germany&rsquo;s case, the nations which have already gnawed off rather extensive tracts of its land over the last century.</p>

There is no possibility for a &#8220;single apology&#8221;, as those who are willing to apologize are not in a position to do so. The British government will not apologize, so it will be a small band of Englishmen apologizing. The only thing such a meaningless apology will do is have its German listeners hoping for more apologies.</p>
<p>The English are also extremely proud of the achievements of their grandfathers, and as a people, are not very apologetic. No good will come from this demand. No one owes anybody anything but their cooperation for a better future.</p>

<p>German nationalists are not the same as any other European nationalists. They notice all the hatred that is directed against them, especially they notice the anti-German sentiments among other Europeans. Germans feel the urge to take revenge. </p>
<p>This vengeance culture is at the very core of German nationalism, and the more people join the German nationalists, the more entitled they will feel to take revenge. I think that a positive attitude of other Europeans towards Germans might go a long way to prevent a German revenge expedition. </p>
<p>There is an incredible amount of frustration among German nationalists, and this needs to be channeled in the right direction, otherwise a new White vs. White war cannot be prevented. To summarise what I am saying: I think it is wise to advise other Europeans to pat the Germans on the back, you do not want them to become your enemies.</p>

Just a few positive comments about Germany and the Germans would be very much appreciated. </p>
<p>My paternal grandmother told me that an American who could speak a little German said that he regretted that so many Germans had died in the War and lost so many of their family members. He also said he thought that the Germans had fought bravely. She has repeated that story for half a century, and told me that a thousand times. Just an expression of respect for the Germans is very much appreciated. Just something small makes a huge impression.</p>

I really have to say that Bully Herbig was the first time I enjoyed German entertainment. Before I had seen some of his stuff all I had seen was a Fassbinder film, and the &#8220;Tin Drum&#8221;. Rather morose and twisted stuff. No, wait. I had seen an Austrian film &#8221; Die Siebtelbauern&#8221; and that was the first time I felt really engaged by anything in German. Then I stumbled across the Bully Herbig stuff on Youtube. It was very lighthearted and it made me seek out more stuff. I found that German entertainment and culture is AWESOME. I think this is because so much of what is produced in America is controlled and the same subliminal message permeates everything, also, political correctness means there is no real humor anymore in American Entertainment. German entertainment makes my mind feel free again. MY latest find has been the show Ladykracher. People in America just don&rsquo;t know what Germans are like, they just know what hollywood says they are like, which is totally wrong.</p>

My friends in Germany with children are seeing the light though. In Western Germany, sending your children to public school can be dangerous. The muslims are bullying and accosting German children quite often now. In the 80s, I was told that this problem only existed in the &#8220;inner city&#8221;. Now it is spread into most school systems. My socialist, liberal, Atheist friends are now sending their children to Lutheran schools. In the recent past, that would be unheard of&hellip;but they are desperate now. Muslims/Africans have destroyed one of the best school systems in the world.</p>

I mentioned to her that I thought the developments in France were good, that I supported LePenn and the Identitarians. She was taken completely off guard, she did not expect to run into anyone who would be on the side of the French &#8220;right&#8221; at a US college. She stated that she was steadfastly AGAINST LePenn and that the right was &#8220;evil&#8221;&hellip;. I guess she is crying in her cafe-au-lait today.<br/>
I think the more that this movement picks up steam then the more people will stop secretly being for it. Most people are followers, they go along to get along. When they think the &#8220;correct&#8221; position, the one that is rewarded and not punished, is liberalism, then they take that position. Liberalism today though means for white people to be against their self interests. You can bet that many people will have a &#8220;conversion&#8221; when they feel it is safe to do so.</p>

I agree with almost all of what Oswald Mosley said in 1939 and much of what Patrick Buchanan wrote about this in 2009. </p>
<p>Most white English people have no responsibility for that decision, but after their own WW2 experience on the battlefield and under bombardment, many still believe the older generation fought bravely in what they felt was a good cause. I find the sinister media propaganda, largely from Hollywood, against Germany objectionable, and regret the susceptibility of people (not only in England) to much of it. I do not expect Germans to apologize for bombing out my late uncle&rsquo;s home, or shooting down without trace my favorite cousin, who had been against war until our country was directly threatened with invasion.</p>
<p>My children and my compatriots of the same age have no need to apologize to prevalent German socialists and liberals who despise their own recent past. I have always advocated Anglo-German friendship, and a general European policy against third-world immigration, etc. My town in Norfolk is twinned with one in north Germany, and my wife&rsquo;s comment on return from a visit was how similar our two peoples were. I love German music and some of its philosophy, and have always actively opposed multi-racialism and imported criminality, from university days to the present time. </p>

I can&rsquo;t speak for everyone, but Italians tend to stay separated from non-whites, plus there have been many protests against illegal immigrants and refugees so I&rsquo;m pretty sure that if they were deported tomorrow no one would say anything.</p>

If the west had not mobilized and went to war with Germany, how long would Hitler have lasted? His economy was on the brink of collapse. That is why he invaded Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Russia. His aim was to plunder those lands to plunder and to buy time. No amount of time would have helped his crazy economic state of affairs though. Sooner or later her would have hit a wall and without a state of war against the allies, the German people would not have felt they were tied to him.</p>

Hitler wanted the return of the German lands and German people that were taken from Germany in the so-called Versailles &#8220;Treaty&#8221;. But this would have made Germany a major threat to Britain&rsquo;s world markets and Britain chose to ally with the communist Soviet Union against Germany. A more stupid decision is hard to imagine. The pretense was to defend Poland against German invasion, but the Soviet Union had also invaded Poland. Add to this the fact that Britain was woefully unprepared to fight the war - any war - and at the end of WWII agreed to hand Poland over to Soviet control. But wasn&rsquo;t the self-aggrandizing Winston Churchill great, drunk or sober?</p>

Hitler was a mixture, and THIS is not the time or place to debate the complex personality or even ideology of a dead, albeit extraordinary, man. He did not want a war with the English, but would not have been a pleasant master if his forces had succeeded in its V2 bombing and a subsequent occupation. His policy in eastern Europe sacrificed thousands of your &#8220;blue-eyed&#8221; handsome, intelligent and courageous young Germans, and their children in street resistance to the Red Army. His policy towards the Jews was so brutally ruthless - by general admission of revisionists also - that it destroyed Jewish communist lives, but also produced both a Communist and then a Jewish propaganda against western nationalism. Far from &#8220;lancing the Jewish abscess&#8221; he created Israel, AIPAC, the ADL, Holocaust Anti-Racist Education, Black Power and Islamic rage. Incidentally, Hitler said Japan could have Australia if they wanted it.</p>

After Hitler&rsquo;s rise, Britain saw Germany as a principal competitor in international markets and put its economic interests above the need to join with Germany in the fight against the rising communist threat of the Soviet Union. The ultimate result of Britain&rsquo;s short-sightedness was the dissolution of the British Empire, the bankruptcy of Great Britain&rsquo;s economy, and a half-century of deficit financing to thwart the Soviet Union&rsquo;s efforts to bring Western Europe into its orbit.

Not only were they required to pay for the entire war, which was just repaid in 2010, much of their land was taken and given to others. This unfairness was also instrumental in the rise of Mussolini. The Polish cheered him when his army entered Poland.</p>

Or let me put it another way. Forget Hitler for a second. Think of some German guy, living in Germany, doing Gemanyey (Germanistic?) things, circa say, 1937. There is German art, culture, and technology all around him. He reads the papers (hence ill informed) and concludes that the citizens of these obscure (to him) and foreign lands must be dusky inferiors. My point is not to justify Nazi misconceptions, (by the way my wife is of Ukrainian descent) but to point out that whatever was wrong with &#8220;Nazi&#8221; ideology wasn&rsquo;t intrinsic to Nazism itself, but could be better understood as the Nazis simply being men of their time and place.<br/>
I am not justifying. Simply giving context.</p>

Despite the unbelievable continuing barrage of attacks against Hitler (e.g., on the History Channel, ad nauseum) it remains a fact that in just four years in the 1930s he brought Germany from a divided and defeated country mired in economic depression to the most vibrant, productive and optimistic country in Europe. No leader, before or since, has accomplished such a feat.<br/>
You, my friend, are the one who is not well-informed.</p>

<p>I am 25% Russian. The start of my Russian Family was the illegitimate son of Catherine the great - a German princess married to some Russian royal back when Russia was a bit on the lower side of European royalty. This Russian royal was a bit weak, Russians have never liked weak rulers ever. There was a coup, Catherine had an affair with a German officer of a sort of Praterian Guard Count Orloff - their son was the start of my Russian family - all German in Russian. But my family became very Slavic and I wouldn&rsquo;t trade my Slavic blood for anything. White Slavs are tough, no idiot liberals or worse Libertarians amongst Slavic people.</p>

<p>In 1959 Oswald Mosley was accorded, though on a multiple policy manifesto, only 8% of the votes in immigration-sensitive North Kensington, about a quarter of his previous canvass returns, and with ballot boxes unprotected by the police, a few of which were later suspected as missing from the count. Later I met Colin Atkins, a young white former agricultural adviser in Africa, who stood as an independent entirely on a &#8220;stop colored immigration&#8221; platform and, after managing almost alone to canvass just a third of his chosen constituency, obtained nearly 20% of the votes cast,</p>

<p>In spite of UKIP&rsquo;s many flaws, I&rsquo;m glad it did as well as it did, mainly because it makes the right people mad. To put it another way, if you put UKIP&rsquo;s problems on one side of the scale, and UKIP&rsquo;s enemies and the vitriol they direct toward it on the other side of the scale, there&rsquo;s no comparison. (It&rsquo;s like Vladimir Putin   &mdash;   He&rsquo;s far from perfect, and does some bizarre things, but the choice is between Putin and the people that hate Putin for the reasons they hate Putin. That said, it&rsquo;s an easy choice for me.) UKIP&rsquo;s success is a pretty good proxy on growing nationalist sentiment in England, and if it did not do that well, our enemies would be taking victory laps.</p>
<p>Marine Le Pen is now probably the white world&rsquo;s most prominent nationalist political figure.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-523961" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Most of the nationalist and crypto-nationalist parties in Europe that contested and got good results in MEP elections this week won because they offered their own people something to vote for, something the people could grasp onto, some raison d&rsquo;etre, some real tangible hope. Especially something positive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the American &#8220;official&#8221; opposition offers us: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie. Yawn.</p>
<p>And worse, our own movement in our own country in too many places, even some of my favorite sources, written by some of my favorite people and bloggers, is promulgating the notion that our movement, WN, EN, HBD, RR, or whatever you want to call it, necessarily depends on failure, destitution and ignorance to be successful. Too many of our people will call losing winning and call a relatively minor win but a win nonetheless, like UKIP in England, to be a loss. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, here comes one blog post after another on some of my favorite blogs hoping for oil to run out (&#8220;peak oil&#8221;) so we can all go back to the stone age, and that way, we&rsquo;ll win and beat our enemies. What a deal. Who&rsquo;s going to want to invest serious power in people that preach and embrace collapse and destitution? Even if they happen to be right about peak oil and civilization fall down go boom, nobody will still trust us with power. As someone who has recently made the lateral move to a job that involves a lot of PR, I can attest that constant negativity is a dead end, especially in politics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be really careful trying to put words in Jared Taylor&rsquo;s mouth, and if I&rsquo;m wrong, I&rsquo;ll be happy to be corrected. But the impression I have gotten from what Jared Taylor has wanted from our movement over the years, and his reason for starting and leading AR, has always been that our movement should be one that is set up in such a way that there&rsquo;s a linear relationship between how successful our movement is and how educated, enlightened and prosperous our people are. In other words, go the opposite way of the nabobs of negativity.</p>

<p>________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I do wonder to what degree the &#8220;libertarian&#8221; positions might be smokescreens for more identitarian ideals. For example, there are probably some libertarians in America who are racial realists and believe that by cutting government down to their desired size (which will never happen, of course), non-Whites would have less ability to leech off of Whites.</p>
<p> <i><b>Could the FN actually take power in France? That is now a real and exciting possibility, but will not happen quite yet. This would probably require a major economic crisis in the Eurozone that finally discredited the existing political class so completely that an electoral majority could be found for radical change.</b></i></p>
<p>________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I understand what Mr. Davies is saying, and I think that it&rsquo;s true. I just want to remark that as long as such political winds depend on economics, we really aren&rsquo;t making much progress. </p>
<p>Economies swing upward and downward, and they are fickle friends when it comes to establishing political momentum. I believe the FN is more animated by opposition to mass immigration and the Islamization of France, though, so I think the FN will continue to swell.</p>

We shouldn&rsquo;t promise economic utopia nor peddle / hope for destruction as a fulcrum to gain power. A good quality nationalist and identitarian message, combined with competent elected officials from our movement, doing a good job once they get power, as FN local officials in France are already doing, will probably inoculate our movement from economic ups and downs.</p>

In the sixties and seventies the British Communist Party saw its membership almost halve at a time of growing left wing militancy. Why? Because the cleverer Marxists realised that the best course of action to take in order to gain power was not to waste their time on a party with no chance of governing but instead infiltrating the Labour Party and changing it to fit their vision for the country. By the early eighties they were in contol of the party and many senior figures took their orders directly from Moscow.<br/>
The BNP&rsquo;s failure is not UKIP&rsquo;s fault but theirs. They are rank amateurs.</p>

Parties like Front National should claim the centrist label, and they should, because they more likely comport with the opinions of the average true Frenchman (i.e., not muslim, Arab, or African) than the socialists or any other party, especially on the FN&rsquo;s core issues. The left knows that unlike the child&rsquo;s aphorism, names do hurt in politics. People who are not as politically aware tend to think of themselves as middle of the road, so they are naturally sympathetic to anyone who claims to be with them. The leftists claim center, moderate, independent labels all the time to exploit that, and they use the extremist, far right labels to cause a divide between us and the low info voters. Claiming the center gives us an in with such people, and we should take it.</p>

<p>But you bring up a good point&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I actually thought hard before saying &#8220;Neo-Con South&#8221; in my post. I was mainly using it to mock the Northerners in the movement who enjoy labeling the South that way even though their part of the country is far more lost in so many ways. It is as if they get excited over the one thing they can accuse Southerners of doing that they claim they aren&rsquo;t guilty of (in regards to racial awareness).</p>
<p>If the South is &#8220;Neo-Con&#8221; then the North must be liberal. In some ways, the distinction fits though, if you consider that this part of the country portrays more of the George Bush view on world affairs.</p>
<p>Labeling the South that way has been engrained in my head so much after reading so many comments on many of the websites in this movement, that it just naturally came out when writing my post. Plus, I thought by writing that, it would perhaps pacify some people.</p>

They attributed the success of the far right to silly paranoia about the economy. The thought that people might not want zillions of foreigners turning their culture on its head didn&rsquo;t seem to occur to them. But the beautiful thing was that immediately after this story, they ran a (kind of weird) story about the hard times of trout fishermen. See, what&rsquo;s happening is that this one kind of trout is &#8220;invading the territory of&#8221; (their words) the other kind of trout and, over time, the two trout groups are &#8220;hybridizing.&#8221; Unfortunately, the hybrid trout are &#8220;decidedly inferior&#8221; to the original trout groups, and the ultimate result is that, because fewer of the hybrid trout survive long enough to reproduce, there is a shortage of trout for the fishermen to catch.</p>

The idea of color blind immigration is stupid and that is the reason for a lot of crime from immigration. Lets hope UKIP get the boot because I believe in both family right as well as Personal rights and a lot of the times I think Family right should be more important than personal right because family is the foundations of all nations. Good job Europe and England. Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>All the news from these Euro elections was basically good news for us. The. Exception being Not so Merry old England.</p>
<p>Another great result was I saw no, Zero support for Ron Paul, Rand Paul race denying, open borders immigration Constitutionalist Libertarianism and/or Austrian School Hayek free marek economics nonsense, not even in Austria. This Austrian cult seems to only seduce confused, deracinated White folks in the United States. Muslim raping/grooming gangs, Jihadist be headers or just women in burkahs tend to cause regular White folks in Europe to shun open borders, Constitutionalist Austrian school free market cults.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-526818" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Even though we all know UKIP is not the long term solution, I still consider the results from Not So Merry Ole to be good, for two main reasons: One, for the reasons that UKIP voters voted the way they did, and two, because many of the right kind of people hate UKIP for having won. It&rsquo;s still a mild win for us, way better than a loss, which is what too many of our people are happy with, losing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have to read in our own international airport demographic polyglot slash open air insane asylum that calls itself a &#8220;country&#8221; that libertarians are scratching their heads wondering why there aren&rsquo;t more black libertarians, as if it&rsquo;s so hard to figure out that the kind of people that would be most hurt by the implications of the implementation of a given worldview aren&rsquo;t flocking to embrace that worldview, and as if we should be wasting mental energy and time wondering why a fringe ideology doesn&rsquo;t have more people from the worst race on Earth professing it. </p>
<p>Then I look at Europe, one win after another after another.</p>

<p>Of course, the same has been true here in the US, to some extent, but the old &#8220;Jeffersonian&#8221; ideal tended to view lower class European Americans with some degree of promise. Regardless, the US and Britain find themselves more or less in the same boat today. But at least your country is still more than 90% white. Not so lucky in the US.</p>
