<div class="intro-paragraph">
The Gypsy problem and its origins.</div> 
</div> 



<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jelena Čvorović, <a href="http://www.ulsterinstitute.org/roma.html"><em>The Roma: A Balkan Underclass</em></a>, Ulster Institute for Social Research, 2014, 254 pp., $25.00 paperback, £5 e-book.</strong></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s immigration disaster in Europe is liable to make us forget that a significant racially alien underclass has already lived on the continent for centuries: the Gypsies, or &ldquo;Roma.&rdquo; Jelena Čvorović, an anthropologist at the Ethnographic Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, is the author of two previous books and many scholarly papers on Serbian Gypsies. In this new title from Richard Lynn&rsquo;s Ulster Institute, she uses r/K selection theory to analyze Europe&rsquo;s centuries-old &ldquo;Gypsy problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>From Northwest India</strong></p>
<p>The ancestors of Europe&rsquo;s Gypsy population originated in Northwest India, moving West, for unknown reasons, about AD 800-950. They were never a homogeneous nation, but, as Dr. Čvorović puts it, a &ldquo;conglomerate of genetically isolated founder populations,&rdquo; with greater genetic diversity than Europeans. Their language, Romany, includes loan words indicating that Gypsies passed through Persia and Armenia, and Byzantine records show that they reached Constantinople by 1054. From Greece, they fanned out across the Balkan Peninsula, and the earliest reports of their presence in Europe date from the 14th century. Some Gypsies traveled as far as France, Spain, and even Britain, but the largest concentrations remain in Eastern Europe:</p>
<p>Country                                   Absolute Numbers                Percentage of Population</p>
<p>Bulgaria                                  750,000                                   10.33</p>
<p>Macedonia                              200,000                                   9.59</p>
<p>Slovakia                                  500,000                                   9.17</p>
<p>Romania                                 1,850,000                                8.32</p>
<p>Serbia                                      600,000                                   8.18</p>
<p>Hungary                                  700,000                                   7.05</p>
<p>[Estimates by Council of Europe, 2010]</p>
<p>The total Gypsy population of Europe is thought to be between 10 and 12 million-greater than the populations of such nations as Hungary or Sweden. They are known by a variety of names, such as Sinti, Manouches, Travelers, Kalo, Romanichals, Tsigani and Gitans. The most commonly used English word, &ldquo;Gypsy,&rdquo; is a corruption of &ldquo;Egyptian,&rdquo; and reflects the mistaken belief that they originated in Egypt. The politically correct term for them, &ldquo;Roma,&rdquo; is what they call themselves, and comes from the name of their language, though many no longer speak Romany.</p>
<p>Dr. Čvorović describes the usual condition of Gypsies in Europe as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Roma communities tend to be segregated and characterized by poverty, unemployment, poor education and poor quality housing. Throughout Europe, the Roma experience social exclusion, a lower life-expectancy (ten to fifteen years lower than the European average), have a higher infant mortality rate and an unemployment rate of up to 80 percent. Since coming to Europe, the Roma have been received with hostility and blamed for everything from petty stealing to child stealing, cannibalism and Satanism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Small, endogamous gypsy populations have typically lived on the margins of European societies, working as traders, craftsmen and entertainers. Their willingness to pull up stakes and move &ldquo;has allowed them to exploit marginal opportunities within their hosts&rsquo; economy,&rdquo; often accepting &ldquo;tasks which no one else wanted.&rdquo; When these sources of income have dried up, they have lived as beggars or thieves. They are described in historical records as traveling in bands of 30-100 under the leadership of an elder.</p>
<p>In various times and places, Gypsies have been forbidden to enter churches, to marry Europeans or to exercise certain professions. In Romania they were even enslaved for a time.</p>
<p>Gypsies are unpopular with Europeans to this day: &ldquo;Many recent public opinion polls confirm that the Roma are by far the most unpopular social group, commonly considered a major burden on slender public resources.&rdquo; This impression is justified. As Dr. Čvorović notes, &ldquo;In Central and South-Eastern Europe, an average of 46.8 percent of Roma families receive social assistance; 56.8 percent receive child support payments.&rdquo; In Bulgaria, fully 90 percent of Gypsies live on state benefits. In Britain, their &ldquo;skillful manipulation of [the] benefits system has brought an outcry from the media, police, and charities for the homeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gypsies, for their part, do not think highly of the <em>gadjé</em> (their term for non-Gypsies). They have a concept of ritual purity according to which <em>gadjé</em> are considered unclean: &ldquo;[M]ost groups restrict their interaction with outsiders to economic transactions and brief encounters with officials or institutional representatives such as welfare or hospital staff.&rdquo; They do not view stealing from or cheating <em>gadjé</em> as morally wrong. Gypsy girls are not permitted to marry <em>gadjé</em>, and are shunned if they do. Gypsy men occasionally take European wives, but the woman must promise to adopt Gypsy ways.</p>
<p>Europeans have made many attempts since the Enlightenment to improve the condition of Gypsies and integrate them into the larger society.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the second half of the eighteenth century under Empress Maria Theresa, Habsburg strategies aimed to eliminate the Roma&rsquo;s nomadic lifestyle and encourage assimilation. In 1761, Maria Theresa embarked on &#8216;settling&rsquo; the Roma by barring them from engaging in most of their traditional occupations and by forcibly removing their children and sending them to school.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Čvorović notes that &ldquo;this endeavor was no more successful than the many similar attempts initiated by later rulers in various nations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Nazis were intolerant of Gypsies and killed an estimated 300,000 to 600,000. The Communist governments that followed were relatively benign. Socialism is a bad system for enterprising or innovative people, but it is not such a bad system for poor workers. Gypsies were guaranteed employment in state-owned enterprises-usually in unskilled positions-but at the same (meager) wages as Europeans, and with the same benefits.</p>
<p>By the same token, Gypsies have suffered more than others in the post-Soviet era:</p>
<blockquote><p>They have been called the &#8216;orphans of transition,&rsquo; reflecting their deplorable experience since the fall of communism. The transition started at a time when the economies of all [East European] nations were near or at the point of collapse, and as a result, impoverishment and unemployment rose significantly. Living standards and general quality of life have declined for many and for the Roma more severely than others. They [suffer from] substandard housing, lack of education and skills and a deepening dependence on state benefits and services.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is such a vast literature on Gypsies and their problems that Dr. Čvorović writes of a scholarly &ldquo;Gypsimania.&rdquo; She notes, however, that most of this literature is &ldquo;characterized by the absence of a general theory and lack of empirical basis to most theorizing.&rdquo; Dr. Čvorović herself applies life history theory and the r/K continuum pioneered by E. O. Wilson and applied to human populations by the late J. Philippe Rushton.</p>
<p>High fertility is the central element of the r reproductive strategy, but it has disadvantages: low investment in the many children that are born, shorter life spans, more high-risk behavior, lower IQ, and a shorter time horizon. The K strategy characteristic of Europeans involves a sacrifice in number of children in order to allow for greater investment in each child; it is associated with higher IQ, long-term planning and an ability to delay gratification. Dr. Čvorović notes that Gypsies and Europeans differ consistently in terms of r/K.</p>
<p>Total fertility rates are currently below replacement for all European countries. In the former communist countries, total fertility fell to between 1.1 and 1.4 children per woman by 2000, the lowest of any region in the world. In nine European nations, the average age of a European woman at first marriage has now passed 30.</p>
<p>Gypsy girls, on the other hand, traditionally marry between the ages of 14 and 17. Pregnancies are one week shorter than among European women, and children are smaller at birth-both biological traits associated with a high-fertility, r-type reproduction. Dr. Čvorović does not provide an overall estimate of current Gypsy fertility, but gives local figures: 3.0 children per woman in Bulgaria, 3.03 in Serbia, 3.12 in Hungary, 3.2 in Bratislava, 3.3 to 3.7 for &ldquo;some&rdquo; groups in Romania, 3.9 in Croatia, and 4.3 in Eastern Slovakia. Both the Gypsies and the problems associated with them will multiply in the coming years. The Minister of Education of one unspecified EU state reports that already &ldquo;in his country, every third child entering school is Roma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gypsies suffer from the drawbacks of the r strategy. Their life expectancy is low; only 2.7 percent of their population is 65 or above, while the figure for the EU is 17 percent. Their high fertility and low life expectancy combine to give Central and Eastern European Gypsies a median age of 20.5, a figure &ldquo;comparable to that of the poorest African or Asian societies.&rdquo; Particularly striking are the ratios of children to old people. Whereas among the declining Europeans there are only 92.1 children (age 15 or younger) for every 100 people age 65 or above, among Gypsies the figure is 1,343.</p>
<p>Gypsies&rsquo; relatively short lives are plagued by health problems. According to UN Development Program documents, child mortality among Hungarian, Czech and Slovak Gypsies is at twice the level of their host populations. In Romania, the ratio is between three and four to one. In Bulgaria in 1989, as communism collapsed, the ratio reached six to one.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular diseases, often brought on by obesity, are the most common cause of death. Gypsies are also reported to have high levels of hepatitis, tuberculosis, skin diseases, and Type-2 diabetes. Many smoke and eat a great deal of fat. Poor hygiene leads to parasitic and contagious diseases. Marriage among close relatives means a high proportion of recessive syndromes, and Gypsy mothers often resist efforts to vaccinate their children.</p>
<p>Dr. Čvorović is an expert on Gypsy IQ; she wrote four papers on Serbian Gypsy IQ with Prof. Rushton. She reports that the highest national IQ for Gypsies is 85 in Slovenia, comparable to American blacks. Other figures are 83 for Slovakia, 70 for Serbia, and 60 for Romania-this last figure is among the lowest recorded for any population, anywhere.</p>
<p>Traditional Gypsy education is informal and oral, though Dr. Čvorović notes that in the typical Roma family, &ldquo;verbal communication is characterized by the absence of abstract or subtle concepts.&rdquo; Many Gypsies are illiterate, and though most Gypsy children now start school, their attendance is irregular:</p>
<blockquote><p>When they do show up, they often arrive without the necessary learning materials, since they regard them as irrelevant and neither they nor their parents know how to use them. During lessons, when they [lose interest], they stand up and walk around or shout at their classmates. Eventually they just stay away from school altogether.</p></blockquote>
<p>Occasionally they are forced out. In England, the rate of temporary suspensions and permanent expulsions is higher for Gypsies than for any other group, including blacks.</p>
<p>East European communist governments and their successors put Gypsy children in special schools, either restricted to Gypsies, or together with learning-disabled European children.</p>
<p>Gypsy children function perfectly well in their own environment, and even solve certain tasks as well as, or better than, European children. For example, they are expected to, and do, find their way around large cities from an early age. However, they have great difficulty grasping abstractions or coping with new situations. For children and adults alike, their normal response when things get difficult is to break off contact. Gypsy self-segregation may in part be a way to avoid the cognitive demands of European society.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Communism, the European Union has been putting pressure on the Balkan states to treat Gypsies better, even though Gypsies themselves interpret this as an attempt to stop them from migrating to the more affluent West. The EU has called for an end to segregated Gypsy schools, for example, despite the good reasons for them.</p>
<p>Twelve European countries with large Gypsy populations have declared the years 2005-2015 to be the &ldquo;Decade of Roma Inclusion,&rdquo; with programs sponsored by the UN, George Soros&rsquo;s Open Society Institute, and national governments. Dr. Čvorović reports that this &ldquo;most ambitious project so far for the most part has failed to provide results in everyday lives for most Roma.&rdquo; If anything, their lives are worse.</p>
<p>I found myself sympathizing with the Gypsies in the face of earnest efforts to integrate them. EU and UN bureaucrats with little knowledge and less experience of Gypsies and their problems persist in imagining that they are only one new program or policy away from producing the first generation of Gypsy PhDs. The principle root of this delusion is, of course, a refusal to accept differences between human populations-this refusal is perhaps the single greatest cause of avoidable evils in the West today.</p>
<p>Territorial separation might not solve the &ldquo;Gypsy problem.&rdquo; Gypsies have no history of political or even economic independence; as noted above, they traditionally exploited marginal niches in the European economy. Forced segregation might be a humanitarian disaster. A more realistic goal might be simply to get them off welfare.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as the Gypsy share of the population grows, Europeans may stop seeing them as objects of charity and consider them dangerous demographic competitors. Certainly none of George Soros&rsquo;s uplift and integration is doing anything to prevent or delay such a development. Finding a policy that is fair to both the Gypsies and Europeans is not simply a matter of good intentions. An essential precondition is recognition of the natural and persistent differences between the two peoples.</p>

Then you have different castes. The highest caste is nearly pure white. But the average Indian actually has white looking skull/facial features if his skin was lighter. I think its because this is a more dominant trait when you cross whites with blacks the white skull shape is more dominant. In the same way darker skin is dominant. Nonetheless a more accurate term would be mixed race, even though this mix has existed for thousands of years as its own racial group.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-654805" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Lithuanian is the oldest living language of Europe. It&rsquo;s nearly identical to PIE (the original Aryan language). Prussian was very similar but they speak German in Prussia now. So lithuanian is actually the closest language to hindi. However, slavic languages are more similar to older Aryan languages. Germanic languages have changed the most from the original Aryan root. We could say lithuanian never &#8220;evolved&#8221;. This also shows that Aryans originated in the Baltics, along with other evidence. Languages tend to change the least where they originated at. One can also find a high portion of blond Nordic types in Baltic countries. However, they aren&rsquo;t really &#8220;superior&#8221; they just have changed the least since ancient times. You should understand also that a ghetto population corrupts a language. Looking at a modern street grub Hindi his language is to Aryan Indian languages as ebonics is to English. </p>
<p>I noticed something similar with German, Russian and a lot of European languages. When certain people speak them with a more noble accent they seem beautiful but a lot of regular people speak them in a rather ugly way.</p>

<p>I would disagree.</p>
<p>The further we get away from what was once sacred, the more profane we become as our genes dilute and cross mix and we self-induce a state of hysterical blindness as the ability to not-see what is happening to our base peoples.</p>
<p>It is the polar opposite of what the racial integrators would have us believe.</p>

PIE is the PC version of proto-Aryan. Arya (Sanskrit) and Aryan (English) MEANS &#8216;noble&rsquo;. Royal. It is what the older peoples of the earth recognized in the Caucasoid peoples before it was deemed uncool to know that some things as bloodlines are natively better than you.<br/>
If you are brought up on the Marxist Lysenkoist ideal of being able to make any loser (plant, beast or man) into a &#8216;superior example of the stock&rsquo;, imagine the shock to discover that some are born better than others.<br/>
Imagine the horrifying truth when admission of this condition leads to the realization that 16% of this planet&rsquo;s population can never give it&rsquo;s mojo to the other 84% of it&rsquo;s retarded groups, even if they cared to try.</p>

I would say the mid level Indians are slightly more Aryan than Dravidian. The upper caste is pretty close to pure Aryan. There are a lot of regional and individual differences as well. Like I said some of their dark skin is probably more related to adaptation to climate rather than race, some of it though is from race.</p>

It has preserved some of the religion and ancient writings. Europe has been at war through most of its history. The main reason India isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;white&#8221; nation is primarily because the Aryan invaders were small in number and also each caste is limited to specific jobs. I think the whitest caste are priests or something and by nature that must be more farmers etc. than priests/religious class or they really would have no role in society. I&rsquo;m no expert on the system though. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-657864" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>One thing about Indian history since independence is that for the first 20 and some years, India was told its caste system was a huge millstone which would have to be rolled out of the way before India could develop. That changed in the 1970s.</p>
<p>India instead turned its caste system into a geopolitical engine and started down the path to world power. My estimation is, a country needs an advanced sector of no more than 50 million people to achieve world power. That mean scientists, engineers, top level entrepreneurs, their families and all of the adjuncts which provide the higher level services necessary to sustain these people. That&rsquo;s how Germany does it. That&rsquo;s America does it, really. That&rsquo;s how it is done, and India snubbed the world to get there. I don&rsquo;t want the West to be like India. But it&rsquo;s their culture and their choice. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the transitional figure who set this process in motion both economically and militarily was Indira Gandhi, a woman. Margaret Thatcher once said, &#8220;If you want something said, get a man. If you want something done, get a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Might be something to that sometimes, although sometimes the process of saying plays the central role. Sometimes things need to be said, and said powerfully. Let&rsquo;s not forget that.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-658198" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I disagree to some extent. Most of India&rsquo;s top talent goes to the United States and other places in the West. This is why we have the Indian doctors and scientists here. The reason is there are better schools here and more money to be made, less corruption (although I guess that is changing). The average citizen doesn&rsquo;t need to be a genius, but just needs to meet basic requirements to reach that level of &#8220;civilized&#8221; the piles of garbage, pick pockets and people drinking raw sewage just doesn&rsquo;t appeal to anyone. A healthy and well adjusted peasant is the backbone of a powerful nation. You can&rsquo;t just have a bunch of ghetto thugs run by a super smart elite at the top. Our American leaders today seem to think so, but I disagree. If anything I would say Germany has proven that model wrong to some extent. They have a really good education system that trains regular people in vocational skills. America neglects its average people and just assumes they are all dumb. </p>
<p>The only thing the United States has done well since about the 1960s is it has attracted the worlds talent. A brain drain has occured in most nations and they typically migrate to the U.S. So while the average American town or city is a ghetto, we still have silicon valley. So it has worked for the U.S. for a while, but I&rsquo;d say economic collapse is coming for us. India is still mostly a simmering cess pool. The only reason their economy is &#8220;big&#8221; is because their population is also big. They have mainly relied on U.S. and European companies outsourcing cheap labor to India as their primary method of economic growth (same in all of Asia really). If the U.S. economy or even Europe goes down, it brings India with it. It&rsquo;s not like they have built anything brilliant or truly vibrant over there. Yeah there are some success stories, but also lots of filthy ghettos that still exist to along with those stories. </p>
<p>They really need to control their underclass to move forward and even at the top I&rsquo;m not sure that they have the raw ability unless they build up a reasonable Jewish or European population. Which from what I know Jews are establishing communities in places like China.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-body-666275" class="dsq-comment-body">
<div id="dsq-comment-message-666275" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Look at Dharavi, the suburb of Mumbai which is larger than the city center. THINK about what would happen if &#8216;food, clothes, shelter&rsquo; as the mantra of the poor were ever to unravel and a ritual cleansing of the hated elites take place.<br/>
Look at Mexico City, third largest urban center on the face of the planet with some 29 million people. Fifty percent of whom live in Colonia slums.<br/>
Bluntly, if the only thing the poor can do is reproduce and in reproducing form a consumer/ditch digger population, think about the social consequences as they keep doubling the population every century.<br/>
Bluntly, economics is an exercise in virtualism vs. thermodynamics in which the physics is sure to win in the end.<br/>
Where:<br/>
1. Derived Work Product can never be greater than Input Energy.<br/>
The nature of &#8216;E&rsquo; is described by the material limits of the resources bulk consumed by the majority group.<br/>
2. Where the Efficicieny of the process is determined by the number of process steps between E-&gt;in and WP-Out, the more steps you have to keep everyone eating, the less efficient (more WP loss in-process) is the system overall.<br/>
3. Where all systems are Entropic, the faster you deplete resources on JUNK consumerism, turning the whole planet into one giant hypocrisy of the Salamander eating it&rsquo;s own tail and never being without hunger. The sooner you reach a point where their are insufficient resources /left/ and the system begins to fail anyway.<br/>
Additionally, realize that the value of money is virtual, it is an illusion. It has NO value in and of itself, but only as a class limiter on what you have access to purchase, whether you really need it or not.<br/>
With this in mind, accept three more conditions:<br/>
1. Money is universal.<br/>
In it&rsquo;s portability. It will buy anything in any given quantity for far less (and far more accurately) than the equivalent, tradable, value in another commodity as barter. Down to the cent.<br/>
2. Money is infinitely scalable.<br/>
You can bring someone into your system without nobility or kindness as a trade for a trade. Instead forcing them to pay for what they want in YOUR currency at exchange rates of 1:100, 1:1,000 or 1:10,000.<br/>
You pay them a hundred dollars and they are fabulously wealthy in their own lands. And utter beggars in yours.<br/>
3. Money is vulnerable to anything which is Free.<br/>
So that anything which is neither purchasable nor scalable such that loyalty or love of one&rsquo;s own Kindred, whether nuclear or racial is a dire threat. Since you might, if you were smart, realize it&rsquo;s better to uplift a single man, once, than to pay him to live on the tortured edge of poverty, as a &#8216;tennant&rsquo;.<br/>
With these truths in mind, Hilter&rsquo;s Germany began a friendly relationship which persists to this day with quite a few South American countries, simply by GIVING THEM the high tech machine tools and farming equipment which transformed societies, in straight trade for everything from copper to corn. Without the middle men financiers getting in the way with their Mafia Cut.<br/>
And &#8216;they&rsquo; plowed Europe under to stop him.<br/>
Finallly, consider what happens when decades of television and the internet tells the 60-80IQ people of the world that they are missing out on a &#8216;human right&rsquo; to the life and pursuit of happiness without concomitant ability to sustain it.<br/>
They keep breeding and using resources until there are not enough to go around and then they look at their economic betters with that certain, green eyed, glimmer in their eye and say: &#8220;Now what?&#8221;<br/>
At a time when we have no space program to get off this rock.<br/>
In this, smart people are just as stupid as dumb ones because our system of capitalized wealth building has not paid off our lowest classes and now that we stand on the edge of a robotics revolution by which someone who gets paid -nothing- can do the same menial work, longer, harder, faster.<br/>
Giving the &#8216;not one of the 50 million&rsquo; no chance at all.<br/>
We are now at that point. Where the 7:1 numeric disparity is looking to crash in the face of a coming, 25:1 disparity (560 million out of 14 billion) for which NO &#8216;SYSTEM&rsquo; will ever be workable.<br/>
And we can&rsquo;t even invest in those anthropomorphic robots to free up labor capital to begin the process of transformation which is to say: free food and shelter and a discretionary fund, in trade for reduced population build.<br/>
Our underclass _demands_ the &#8216;Obama strategy&rsquo; of direct stimulus as free cash instead.<br/>
We have screwed ourselves being too smart to figure out what needs doing. Until there is nothing left to do but continuing down the road to oblivion.<br/>
It would be funny if it weren&rsquo;t so tragic.</p>

Recall the article here a few years back which highlighted Indian marriage magazines whose date-your-mate advertisements first stated requirement was: &#8220;Dark skinned need not apply.&#8221;<br/>
There may be something in the genetic interaction between a more translucent skin and sunlight which causes neurosynaptic connections to have to form more rapidly/densely in the face of blood cells &#8216;popping&rsquo; them with delivered oxidants.<br/>
Whites need to recognize that, from bleaching and hair weaves to the removal of epicanthic folds to specific cultural and certainly marriage ritual selection, the only people who don&rsquo;t like or want to be white on the planet are whites themselves.<br/>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-666703" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>My problem with this site and most like it is that priorities and strategies aren&rsquo;t clearly thought out and articulated. We have all these articles and comments about how inferior non-whites are. It serves little to help whites and the more important issues should be the that whites are going extinct and also the rampant anti-white discrimination, along with a media and school campaign of disinformation and white guilt regarding the subject. All of the &#8220;whites are supreme&#8221; or &#8220;blacks are stupid&#8221; posts, articles, threads etc. are counter productive to helping the main cause. </p>
<p>In regards to &#8220;dark skinned need not apply&#8221; this generally refers to black people. In china if you are a typical light colored asian or even a light colored Indian, &#8220;swarthy&#8221; Italian type etc. you aren&rsquo;t really dark enough to be shunned. They mainly dislike actual black people or the lowest castes of their own society which tend to have darker skin in most cases and also sometimes more negroid features. It&rsquo;s not as though in India they are expecting blond nordic types. What they considered &#8220;light&#8221; would be considered dark by north european standards. There does seem to be a near universal dislike of black people (in that people don&rsquo;t want their daughter marrying one) everywhere except in white nations where a massive propaganda campaign has instilled in us how &#8220;cool&#8221; black people are and how sexually desirable they must be. Beyond that nordic features might be desirable from a standpoint of being exotic, in the same way a european might find an asian woman exotic, but it&rsquo;s not like they view their own race as undesirable or inferior. Although to some degree white features are held as symbols of beauty but this is not the case with all people. Some people prefer the ethnic Indian or Asian look (even Native American look is considered highly attractive in some cirlces- for example Brazillians). </p>
<p>Skin wise I have to say certain Native Americans have the most attractive skin. It looks a bit like a white man with a really nice tan and really smooth complexion with a hint of red tinge. Similar to some degree with perhaps certain swarthy white people that tan well- certainly is considered more attractive generally than some pale as a ghost albino (except for people that are into that).</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-666877" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Going back to the Kama Sutra, the idealized partner in Indian sexually selective mating is shown as blue-white (the god skin symbolism) or olive skinned (most females) with a skin tone found nowhere else on Earth.<br/>
That said, today&rsquo;s high fashion in India shows a phenotype that would be considered high tone Latin or Hispanic. In this, the paler you are, the farther you can travel in their society as a function of aesthetics and likely (generations of in-group hypergamous breeding) intelligence.<br/>
Indians prefer being white and will do -anything- (including dangerous bleaching treatments) to alter their skin tone and improve their marriage chances.<br/>
As for this site, I think something like a slam-o-meter might be appropriate with news articles collated along lines of &#8216;Criticisms of Whites vs. Black Crime Today.&rsquo; so the actual disparity between what whites are told we do and what we actually -do-, relative to other races could be highlighted, indicating how massively biased the Jewish MSM really is in terms of<br/>
White Crime, Ethnic Crime, Ethnic Crime Unreported.<br/>
Whether such a meter could be created, based on contributors providing daily URLs listings for non-white crime, and keeping it sufficiently &#8216;clean&rsquo; (no overlaps, no garbage links) to provide a realistic billboard for the site, I don&rsquo;t know. I think it should be tried and could be kept to the top five most dangerous cities in the U.S. or perhaps the top four and Tokyo or Stockholm for comparison.<br/>
Other than that lighthouse beacon of truth on the horizon, we are beyond saving those who don&rsquo;t want to be. The battle for their hearts and minds has been fought and lost, in the classroom, 20-30 years ago. It may be refought again in the future but only to the extent that we generate a massive ground swell of counter opinion which says: &#8220;Thou shalt not be afraid to be loyal to what you love. Because the alternatives are not as golden as you may think&hellip;&#8221;<br/>
The next phase of the white survival strategy instead has to be pragmatic in both setting an example of who we really are and in providing real help to each other. You want to be part of a white culture group?<br/>
Fine.<br/>
This is how dress, groom, and bear yourself (I&rsquo;m _not_ kidding, we need to sponsor classes so that behaviors become second nature), these are the drugs and music and friends you DON&rsquo;T associate with or you&rsquo;re out.<br/>
This is the whom you benefit and who you don&rsquo;t.<br/>
&#8220;In trade for which&hellip;.&#8221;<br/>
Tell us your dreams and we will help you get there. A place to live where you can accumulate a savings plan to get that college course or trade skill you need.<br/>
A car or a ride in one to make sure you reach your job/class etc. on a daily basis without the hassle and cost of multiple bus trips.<br/>
Access to the kinds of people who share your views so that you don&rsquo;t have to feel compressed by an ugly society you can&rsquo;t talk about with people who are looking for specific hypergamous outcomes rather than racial loyalties as common interests.<br/>
Our older folk are in a position where a lot will die without a single child to give their wealth to and are now approaching an age where they need serious help sustaining a household or even moving away from a bad neighborhood into a better living condition.<br/>
There is a tradeable option there as the reality of &#8220;You need a home to get a headstart on everyone else in attracting a wife and having a life, you can have this one, if you will agree to do X things while I live.&#8221;<br/>
Groceries, painting, landscaping, home improvement, transport to X with security.<br/>
That we in fact do this among our own, exclusively, rotating the duty as skillsets among a database listing of people with particular training vs. people needing them would push us towards a condition whereby young folk could start to develop real interest in serving our cause becuase they would see it as in their best interests.<br/>
As monetary stability, simply by trading a living wage for whites-only aid.<br/>
What do I mean by &#8216;living wage&rsquo;? You do someone X amount of work, you get 5-7-10 bucks an hour, under the table, but you also get to stay a week with them while you accomplish the task and this is a week of rent and food _you don&rsquo;t have to pay for_.<br/>
Obviously, such a system would have to start out small and local with a lot of vetting involved. But imagine a poor white youth who found that, in trade for labor, they could make a little cash and _NOT_ immediately turn around and throw it away on rent and utilities.<br/>
This is the kind of stuff that cannot be done in a public forum. It would have to be set up privately via a chatroom style posting service and that is also something that Amren could offer with the proviso that it not be used for illegal activities and that those who wanted to add their names to an AmRen labor list be willing to front the costs of a background check.<br/>
We need to turn inwards. We need to fold within ourselves those who are at least willing to consider what we say as being true but who are scared to death of being black balled as &#8216;racists&rsquo; for the rest of their lives.<br/>
This is where AmRen fails whites. Because it has all of the risks but none of the payoff inherent to abandoning the artificial limits of PC and calling life as you see it rather than what is expected of you to say &#8216;nice things about&rsquo;.<br/>
IF we could make young white people&rsquo;s lives a lot easier, we might sway a lot more opinions. We would certainly come to realize among our own that we are not the lone voice in the wilderness that it often seems we are. And we would create a support base of people that secure their wealth internally with a system of barter trade and low fee labor that is beyond government oversight.<br/>
On a massive scale.<br/>
If you want to sway white opinion about other races, the first thing you must do is show them the difference between the ignoble, disenfranchised, do-nothings of our own rootless people. And the White Race Reborn that is a Pro White society acting solely in it&rsquo;s own interests and raising it&rsquo;s young people to a higher standard of ethics and conduct.<br/>
Isn&rsquo;t that what Renaissance means?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-653906" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>In 1983, French artist Daniel Guichard made <em>Le Gitan</em>, one of his most successful songs to this day. The song was about &#8220;the Gypsy&#8221;, maliciously roaming the streets, engaging in thievery, producing thuggish laughs, and always seeming happy. </p>
<p>Today, he would&rsquo;ve probably been sued for such lyrics. Although the song undeservedly glorified the Gypsy and gave it a place in French culture the same way The Godfather mythicized the Italian mafia. So it wasn&rsquo;t all that derogatory. </p>
<p><em>&#8220;He doesn&rsquo;t know where&rsquo;s from, but he knows where he&rsquo;s going; he has a thousand cousins - the Gypsy, the Gypsy, the Gypsy&hellip;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from a recent remake of the song with a Spanish band.</p>

I think a large part of that is do to the fact that the Italian police and carabinieri don&rsquo;t cuddle them like blacks are cuddled by our police. It was obvious to me that like the Albanians and Moroccans the Italians and their law enforcement really didn&rsquo;t like them at all. Needless to say during my stay their my wife at the time had her purse stolen once by them. Not sure how they treated in other European countries though. </p>

There is not much sense, IMO, of arguing which is worse. Key issue is that both groups have been an on-going canker sore to the White European civilizations they are camping out in, and need to return to their respective racial homelands. Negroes here in the states are extremely violent. Their recent riots and violence in Ferguson, MO are a good example of this, as well as the intense level of violence in all Negro cities such as East St. Louis, Benton Harbor, MI, and Gary, IN. We are talking about homicide rates upwards of 50 per 100,000, the highest levels of violence, by far, in all of Western Civilization. Liberals love to pretend that this violence is a result of White racism. These Liberals are full of garbage. The underlying issue here is the regressive behavioral patterns of the Negro race. I suspect that race is also the key catalyst for Gypsy sociopathy in Europe. </p>

Negroes are not an introspective or self critical race, though, so keeping them in a position of subordinance and deference to Whites is critical if orderliness is to be maintained. Is this true of the Roma? The lack of adjectives describing subtlety or nuance, in their language, points to a temperament similar to the Negroes. </p>

Not only do they find lying and stealing permissible. They also find violence permissible, and do not need a cause to fight for to act violently. Random, senseless brutality is the norm with them. Nothing manages to filter this out of their system. Generations in a Western land, and what do we have? Ferguson, Missouri. </p>

Wade has the nerve to argue that the reason more gentile whites in America do not raise their children like Jews, East Asian and Indians do is because they lack the capacity. Actually, whites in America are subjected to engineered cultural and legal barriers which make it difficult for them to do so.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the impetus, though it is likely to be unavailing, toward encouraging participation in STEM education. The establishment wants to direct this toward minorities but ignore the largest population group with a proven ability to produce STEM-trained professional and technical workers, the white male.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong making education and training available to all, this is America, and some NAM&rsquo;s will succeed. But the when the effort is directed not at increasing numbers generally, but at increasing percentage representation, the result can only be a depressing travesty.</p>
<p>White women, of course, represent the next largest group of potential STEM professionals and skilled workers, but here the issue of percentage representation looms yet larger. Increasing the numbers and increasing representation are not two names for the same thing.</p>
<p>America needs to increase its numbers of Native-born STEM professionals, to compete with China, India and a number of smaller countries. America does not need numerical goals which can be achieved only through suppressing the white male</p>

<p>&#8220;In a manifesto of his Yisrael Beitenu party published Friday, Avigdor Lieberman says he favors ceding Arab majority areas in northern Israel to a future Palestinian state and providing economic incentives for Arab-Israelis  &mdash;  about 20 percent of Israel&rsquo;s population  &mdash;  to encourage them to emigrate.&#8221;</p>

In urban civilizations men with the intelligence to become merchants, scribes, government officials, money lenders, artists, writers, and so on have usually been more prosperous than laborers. They have usually been more prolific.</p>
<p>The lower average IQ&rsquo;s of blacks can be explained by their comparatively recent exposure to civilization. Large numbers of them only began living in cities during the twentieth century. Urban neighborhoods of blacks are not known for civilized behavior. They are aptly referred to as &#8220;asphalt jungles.&#8221; </p>
<p>India, which is the origin of the gypsies, has a tradition of civilization at least four thousand years old. The social dysfunction of gypsies requires an evolutionary explanation that is unclear to me.</p>

A very nice elderly English lady was being endlessly harrassed by her new gypsie neighbors. Teenage boys were bullying an old lady, how courageous. The metro police would do nothing to help the white lady. They told her, &#8220;this is part of their culture, you will have to get used to it&#8221;. One white policeman had sympathy and told the &#8220;youths&#8221; to leave her alone or else. The &#8220;youths&#8221; did what he said but reported him to his superiors. The kind, responsible policeman was promptly removed from his duties, and the harrassment of the old lady continued. Your government (and ours) is disgusting. There are some exceptions to that rule, but the scum of the earth prevails. They care nothing about what the majority wants. They continue to quietly push genocidal policies on us without our consent. I don&rsquo;t read the BBC and similar anymore. Most of my UK news comes from the BNP. That is the only reality I know of. </p>

I know many of our leaders say it is counter productive, but if you have a certain amount of media exposure, violence is a useful tool. The Irish/British protestants often say on the media outlets that violence works because they have seen it work for the Catholics. I should point out that I am a Catholic but I agree. A community of some 750,000, brought one of the most powerful nations in world to the negotiating table through economic sabotage and social chaos. Just some advice to my European brothers and sisters.</p>

Seriously, just another example of how you cannot treat all people from all races and cultures, the same. It takes a lot to make an advanced culture. This includes hundreds of generations of breeding. Obviously, the Gypsies are just bred to be nomadic parasites. </p>
<p>They are a lot like our blacks. But, there are THREE major differences that make our blacks more dangerous: American blacks are far more violent than Gypsies; second, American blacks insist on INTEGRATING INTO WHITE CULTURE-they are not content to be outsiders; and finally, our culture insists that blacks should be treated PREFERENTIONALY to Whites. All in all, I would take Europe&rsquo;s Gypsies if they would take our blacks.</p>

The best thing would be to put the gypsies on some kind of reservation, or simply give them their own Israel, somewhere. Preferably far, far away.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve been with us a long time now and some of you have an awful lot of white DNA. Some of you seem like fine people, and have certainly contributed a lot of positive things.</p>
<p>There is just unfortunately no denying the negative impact on average of your presence in our societies. I think this is an inevitable consequence of permitting a small, intelligent, resentful minority which is highly effective at subversion, power grabbing, and bending us to their will over time.</p>
<p>The survival strategy employed by Jews may make all the sense in the world from the Jewish perspective. I have no hatred for them. I just recognize the destructive (overall) impact they have had among us, and wish we Euros could just be intact, no exceptions.</p>
<p>I hope you can understand those sentiments and the accompanying frustration which sometimes leads to comments which hurt or alienate you.</p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;m very undecided on this issue. Are Jews people who&rsquo;ve made mistakes that endanger us both along with us also making those mistakes? Can they, as a whole, be &#8220;woken up&#8221; as we hope regular whites can be, and be allies? Or are they the very root of the problem&hellip; the Trojan horse which throws open the gates every time?</p>
<p>I am unsure.</p>

He asked in a way that was calculated to amuse and highlight the absurdity, and seemed to be sort of a &#8220;meta&#8221; joke about &#8220;let me be the one honest beggar and see if that works.&#8221;</p>
<p>I found it amusing and was still a libtard so I gave him a couple of dollars. He did a couple of little &#8220;worship&#8221; bows and said &#8220;praise the generous, mighty white man&#8221; or something like that.</p>
<p>My appearance is such that I likely come across as a sort of personification of ultimate whiteness, or at least a certain strain of it. I think that&rsquo;s part of why he reacted that way. I was dressed in a very white way, had my very white girlfriend with me, and I was also born and raised and spent the vast majority of my life in a very, very white area of this country. I think people pick up on that, just like they&rsquo;d pick up on you coming from another country. I definitely didn&rsquo;t strike him as a Seattle native, I would imagine.</p>

Of course the reality is that out of millions or billions of people a handful will have a high I.Q. They import a few of these extreme examples and parade them showing us that these people are superior to whites. It&rsquo;s not much different with East Asians actually, although they are a little higher performing than this.

That&rsquo;s what happened in the Galapagos.<br/>
China is proof of what happens when R-selection out favors K. You get a massive population which &#8216;wins by squattering&rsquo; as control over terrain, jobs and resources.<br/>
The real killer however is inbreeding and generational intervals. If you have kids at 14-17 you&rsquo;re brain is still developing and the same FOX P2 gene that effects conceptualization in the grey matter is also a gonadotropic which acts on the gametes, epigenetically.<br/>
Large numbers of children from an early age = rapid generational assortation amongst a small in-group which is going to negate the rise of any higher talent in one of three ways:<br/>
1. Through Inbreeding Deficit.<br/>
Though obviously this fraction cannot be too high because their is no associated fertility depression overall.<br/>
2. By lack of Social Resources.<br/>
As a means by which high end intelligence can manipulate and improve it&rsquo;s bearer&rsquo;s condition. Instead, all resources go to the group to sustain itself a whole.<br/>
3. By Evolutionary Entropy.<br/>
If Epigens act on a person&rsquo;s abilities through empirical activation and shutdown and you have a lot of kids before your body is at &#8216;full tune&rsquo; with whatever gene skills your population brings to the table, imagine what happens when you repeat this mistake, over and over and over. Your people never gain evolutionary traction, never start to move forward. Always fall back to LCD norms by which the group as a whole is comfortable.</p>

The Aryans who invaded India circa 2000BC originated somewhere north of the Black Sea on the Ukrainian Steppe.<br/>
After conquering India, they only ever really formed a small, elite, part of the general Indian population, they were always vastly outnumbered by Dravidian and tribal Indians. Hence they devised the caste system to try to preserve their genetics, an effort that proved largely unsuccessful over the course of many centuries - basically any Aryan component that can be found in the vast majority of typical Indians is very small.</p>

There are 5,000 year old texts that speak of the Aryans that are still around in India. Despite this our Western leaders have re-written history and say it&rsquo;s all racist psuedo science made up by the British. I don&rsquo;t think the British made up something that is in a book that predated them by thousands of years, but the leftist propaganda is never logical or consistent. It&rsquo;s just like they say Aryan aren&rsquo;t a real race, but the word Aryan is found in those old documents, referring to a race of people.</p>

<p>Lucius Aryan writes that before the coming of the Thracian Dionysus in India the local population was nomadic and has not built any cities. They dressed in furs, eating bark and raw meat. The Thracian gave them the fire, taught them how to plow and sow, how to make wine, to build, to forge weapons, also gave their laws and religion. He put himself at the head of the new pantheon. In other words, according to Aryan Dionysus was the founder of the ancient Indian civilization.</p>

Alcohol, especially wine, played an important role in Greek culture with Bacchus being an important reason for this life style.[4] His name, thought to be a theonym in Linear B tablets as di-wo-nu-so (KH Gq 5 inscription),[5] shows that he may have been worshipped as early as c. 1500–1100 BC by Mycenean Greeks; other traces of the Dionysian-type cult have been found in ancient Minoan Crete</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-664485" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I stand corrected. Dionysus (Zagreus) was a Thracian king, who led a march into India. After his death, he was deified. The Dionysian cult is indigenous, predating the Greek invasion of the Balkans. The cult was adopted by the Greeks (who lacked the enzymes to drink the wine they imported from Thrace and diluted it with water), and later on by the Romans (as Bacchus). So yes, Dionysus became a Greek god.</p>
<p>The Thracian (Dionysian) Mysteries, practiced by the Thracian followers of Orphism were a jolly affair involving lots of wine, other intoxicants and trance-inducing techniques, and of course - sex.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-654797" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I probably should have mentioned this but I think to a small degree Indians have darker skin simply because they live further south. Yes mixture plays a role but some of them look very Aryan but with darker skin. I know I&rsquo;m pale as a ghost living in ohio but look like some dark complected Indian or something living in Florida so I wouldn&rsquo;t put too much emphasis on skin color. The upper caste of India has people born with blue eyes and blondish hair (rare but happens) and white skin would pass for a southern european easily. But other than the lowest castes most of their facial features are european which is why technically they are caucasions even though they have been reclassified as Asians for the purpose of free handouts. The gypsies are a little lighter skinned due to the northern climate but still have a swarthy look compared to their Aryan neighbors. I guess if someone was 1/4 gyspy or something and lived among a normal European community you possibly wouldn&rsquo;t notice anything odd in his heritage, but the gypsy population as a whole has mainly evolved itself as a parasitic class. They don&rsquo;t farm or build anything, mainly just live off welfare, swindle, put up circus attractions etc.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-654410" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Comparing Europe&rsquo;s Gypsy population to the massive incessant wave of Afro Asian immigration into Europe is an interesting execise.<br/>
The article states that there are around 10 million Gypsies in Europe. Now consider this, the original nucleus population of Gypsies who first entered Europe some 700 years ago must have been small. It cannot have numbered more than a few thousand at most. What&rsquo;s more, there was likely only one wave of Gypsy immigration that lasted for a specified and short time period.<br/>
Now, black/brown immigration into Europe occurs on a truly mammoth scale. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions immigrate every single year, year in year out. There is absolutely no chance of the flow ever attenuating let alone ceasing, so we can confidently state it will last forever, and will accelerate to even greater numbers, genuinely there is no limit. The political class INSISTS that this should be the case. No dissent from this positon is tolerated. As an aside, expect state sponsored assasinations of anti-immigration activists in the near future.<br/>
If thre historic case of the Gypsies provides any guide, then most likely indigenous Whites will effectively vanish from Europe in a century or two&rsquo;s time hence.</p>

This is why all those who can prove their gypsy ancestry should be given a million dollars due to historical oppression. The gypsies were all kings and queens in their homeland and all their poverty is caused by white people. But to deport them back home is a terribly racist and horrible thing to do, because it would harm them not to live among whites, as an integrated community. Now we must take efforts to ensure the genetic purity of gypsies by upholding their ancient tradition of refusing to marry outside the cultural group. If a white person refuses to marry a gypsy though this is extreme racism and he/she should go to jail for being a Nazi. War is peace. Slavery is freedom.

<p>I disagree. It&rsquo;s just such an attitude from both the left and the right that has every white nation on this earth in danger of no longer being white. The obvious solution for whites is for white men to breed with them, in the old-style man to woman, marriage type, relationship. Barring that the solution would be to remove them from Europe or give them their own territory inside it.</p>
<p>If there is a sickness, it is that (apparently) not a single red-blooded male AmRener has consider this? How deep is your commitment to our race, really? Mustn&rsquo;t startle the white woman in any way, even in a potential way, lest things go even harder on you?</p>
<p>Yes, a 1.4 fertility rate would eventually become a problem (outside of possibly an economic one) but it&rsquo;s not now. Europe is severely overcrowded. </p>
<p>The problem is the failure of integration it is not the different populations inhabiting the same territory. For all we know it&rsquo;e presence of non-whites themselves that is causing the White birth rate to be so low. Again, that&rsquo;s a good thing, for now, the problem is them.</p>

European stock won&rsquo;t fight to produce more offspring to dump into a hellhole. They will reproduce less in that circumstance, or try to move. Natural borders used to protect us from the reptilian third world. Now, we must make legal and man made replacements or we will surely perish. We must change our leadership and opinion makers. The very existence of civilization is at stake. The Immigration act of 65 must be repealed, and expulsion by deportation must be accomplished on a very large scale.</p>

Also, since when did sticking for Whites equate to hating Jews? That is one reason why White Support will never gain any momentum.

<p>Making an honest living? Really? Yeah we always can use more anti white filth from Hollywood. We can always use more ambulance chasing lawyers and leftist professors in academia. We can always use more billionaire corporate welfare queens. More pornographers and employees for the SPLC, AIPAC and the ADL. Yeah thank God for all their contributions.</p>

Jews did indeed give humanity such inventions as the polio vaccine, anesthesia, novocaine, and many other advancements in science, technology, the arts and entertainment, and in other fields.</p>
<p>Not all Jews are evil people like Karl Marx, Bernard Madoff, or Lazar Kaganovich, the evil man who helped Joseph Stalin starve to death millions of Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Not all Jews are liberals. There are even Jews who support American Renaissance. Not all Jews are against the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms like Michael Bloomberg, Diane Feinstein, or Charles Schumer. One of the most prominent organizations even more zealous than the NRA in defending the right to bear arms is Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership. and you do not even have to Jewish to join. Many their members are not Jewish.</p>
<p>But you may ask why I am posting this comment to defend Jews and vigorously make the point that not all Jews are bad? Here is the answer: can you please name even one accomplishment in the arts, sciences, medicine, technology, or other achievements to better humanity done by Gypsies? </p>
<p>Not all Germans went along Hitler. There were many Germans who made heroic failed attempts to stop Hitler. Besides Oscar Schindler, there were many Germans who also helped Jews. like providing Jews with false identity papers, or finding places to hide Jews.</p>
<p>Many Jews even in Israel openly condemn what is being done to the Palestinians. Even in Israel, there are Israeli Jewish activists who are actively fighting to stop the human trafficking that is happening in Israel.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, there are no Gypsies who condemn the evil thieving culture that makes them so universally hated. There no Gypsy activists who condemn the bigotry Gypsies have against us gadjes. There are no Gypsies who are demanding that Gypsies stop stealing, begging, and become useful citizens of the countries they live in, by doing honest work to make a living. There are no Gypsy activists who demand their people change their evil ways and now start to consider it wrong to steal from us gadjes!</p>
<p>And that reminds me, maybe if black people were to stop being criminals, behave themselves and also become useful productive citizens, we would not have such a racial powder keg here in the United States of America!</p>

<p>That quote above this site is just a con-job. The sites creators simply wish to pretend that we let it all hang out here. This site isn&rsquo;t controlled. Not this site. Nope.

<p>Despite AmRen &#8216;censoring&rsquo; anti-semitism, those who run the site are at least partly allowing the idea to spread. </p>
<p>Jews are getting &#8216;revenge&rsquo; for the holocaust. Oh, no one thinks that now! Too complacent, or too much into white-supremacy, or too reactionary to consider that. </p>
<p>If you ask me, that&rsquo;s a dumb idea all around. White boys are too intelligent not to know who their real enemy is. They can&rsquo;t be fooled. It comes from their superior genes.

The New Delhi Indians I&rsquo;ve encountered tend to be polite when you first meet them, but this is just a result of their having been an English colony. They are extremely arrogant, but are rarely very intelligent where critical thinking is required. They also have horrendous body odor. </p>

Of course if the British not purchased White slaves the trade would not have existed. In the 19th and early 20th century British gypsies enjoyed the favored criminal class status the Africans, pakis and arabs now enjoy. The famous scots economist Adam Smith was kidnapped by gypsies when he was 3 years old. Fortunately his parents had enough money to hire a bounty hunter who found him and restored him to his family. The fact that there were people who made a living rescuing children from gypsy kidnappers shows how widespread the kidnapping was..</p>

I knew someone who lived in Hungary for about 20 years. He told me how they treated their government housing. They ripped of the sinks, stoves and other fixtures and sold them. They tore out the heating and water pipes and ducts furnaces and electrical wiring. They even rolled up the linoleum and tore off the sheetrock and studs.<br/>
Then when they sold all these items they wondered why they had no place to live. He said the gypsy housing projects were something like American indian reservations only the gypsies stayed there and never left to go to school, work or do anything normal. He said they were all on welfare but many never got to spend the money. The big bully gypsies all had extortion rackets going. The welfare money was turned over to the big bully gypsies.</p>

Europe is the Thracian region of the lower reaches of the Evros (Hebros, Maritsa, Meriç) River and it&rsquo;s tributaries Arda and Tunca - roughly todays Evros region in Greece, Haskovo and Yambol districts of Bulgaria and the Adrianople (Edirne) vilayet in Turkey.<br/>
Furthermore, there is no such thing as &#8220;Greece&#8221; in the 10th century.</p>

The video was made recently. One might expect a bit of fade since the &rsquo;70s, maybe outdated, slightly broken fixtures but still serviceable if shabby. However, the apartments looked as if they had been torn apart by savage hordes of Mongols rampaging through on horseback. Or a high-rise project in Detroit, housing both Bloods and Crips and their families for 40 years. It was utterly disgusting. There wasn&rsquo;t a lightbulb in the entire building. The pipes were all exposed, the drywall ripped out, mattresses spread in the hallways, all fixtures and tiles torn out of every room including the bathroom, families eating in what were once bathrooms, squatting as there were no chairs, fires built in little pots and the toothless hags (age 30 but could be mistaken for 60) cooking over it on a piece of fence as a barbecue. Crazy stuff. And are these the people whose &#8220;children are forced out&#8221; of the classroom? Don&rsquo;t you love the leftist academic&rsquo;s language arts implying European micro-aggressions? It&rsquo;s enough to make a person sick.</p>

It&rsquo;s an easy answer to mature minds, but immature babyish intellects can simply not handle the truth which is that we cannot change these nonwhites and asiatics into ourselves and assimilate them. Instead of accepting this maturely, leftists and libtards just shake their little rattles and howl and cry for yet another &#8220;intervention&#8221; on behalf of &#8220;underserved&#8221; foreigners who should not even be here. They are sick in the head, bereft of plain common sense and bereft of any ability to accept an outcome they don&rsquo;t like, or an outcome that doesn&rsquo;t feed their adolescent egos. Things don&rsquo;t go their way and it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s fault. The whole mess is the fault of liberal leftist white mental cases, spurred on by Jewish intellectual movements designed to diversify European and white societies to the point where they themselves feel safely indistinguishable from white gentiles. It seems to me they passed that point long ago but won&rsquo;t be satisfied till all whites are destroyed. In the meantime, indigenous elderly Europeans and poor native Europeans should be content to lie on their newspapers in the streets and starve while the Roma and imported Africans are coaxed into council homes, given weekly spending money and cigarettes, handed jobs, and have their asses kissed and spit-shined by the assholes ruining our countries. Where will we go when our own countries are gone?</p>
