At the other extreme, it can mean anyone but a straight white non-Jewish heterosexual cisgendered man. With lots of room and many gradations in between.</p>
<p>If you think SV has lots of diversity because SV firms have lots of Asians, then you&rsquo;re using the definition of diversity that means anyone but white people. But the left uses &#8220;diversity&#8221; in the sense of the SV not having enough of it to mean that the line is between blacks/Hispanics and whites/Asians, meaning in this instance, Asians are considered to be honorary white people, or at least not diverse.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-637424" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Effectively meritocracy is de facto white (and Asian) supremacy. Consequently those whites who advocate meritocracy are advocates of white supremacy every bit as much as those who advocate a de jure form of white supremacy such as Jim Crow. The only alternative to white (or Asian) supremacy - whether de jure or de facto - is black (or brown) supremacy. And this is what we have seen. Consistently all minorities, including Asians, have sought legal or other sorts of privileges at every opportunity.</p>
<p>It is just this tendency to advance group interest that makes a color-blind society impossible. If whites set aside group interest in order to advance a more just color-blind society but other groups do not set aside their own group interest to the same extent as whites then whites will not be accomplishing a more just society but will instead be putting in place a system of their own oppression.</p>

Like so many tribe members who have not been exposed to Negro sociopathy, he fears a reprisal of Germany 70 years ago while he should be looking at Ferguson, and fearing Crown Heights. Crown Heights will be the norm in a country where Whites are a minority. Insightful tribe members are cognizant of this reality. Monsey and Kiryas Joel are possible due to being surrounded by Whites. Zuck apparently prefers The Gaza Strip to Kiryas Joel. </p>

Firearms are meant to be used by White men with cool heads and presence of mind, not by impulsive Negroes with two digit IQ&rsquo;s. Guns are meant for hunting wildlife and the rare case where self defense is necessitated, not for fulfilling the impulsive whims and sociopathy of Negro thugs. Firearms in the hands of the Negro is one of the worst things that has ever happened to Western Civilization. Firearms should only be owned by mature men of integrity and exemplary self control. </p>

So few in fact, that many business and political leaders believe they must import people to create the all-important growth on which they are measured and compensated. But instead of white women going home to bear and raise white children, you&rsquo;d have them armed and acting as the world&rsquo;s police and soldiers? Newsflash! Nobody else can do the white woman&rsquo;s biological job. And if they completely stop we are extinct. </p>
<p>This is perhaps the first point of our failure - the mistake from which all others follow. There is <i>nothing</i> a white woman can do that is more important than bearing and raising <i>white</i> children. If she&rsquo;s unable, she may help others or go on to try and find fulfillment in other ways, but motherhood - <i>white motherhood</i> is the one thing I truly believe to be sacred. </p>

In fact, by all evidence, the more people of color you import, the more the white birth rate goes down. Certainly the number of white children being born goes down. Admittedly, if you flood a white nation with Enough people of color the white birth rate will go up. Stats on &#8216;the white birth rate&rsquo; only consider the woman/white mother. How many millions of male immigrants of color will need to be imported in order to raise the white birth rate to 2.1? On the one hand, non-white immigration seems to lower the white birth rate. On the other hand, if there is Enough male non-white immigration into a white country it can raise the white birthrate back up. What is the proper balance? I don&rsquo;t know but it would see like the only way to preserve whites themselves is to keep out non-white immigrants.</p>

Please name anything these people have ever done on their own? All the great programs have been created by whites. Asians are hanging onto the coat tails of whites as usual. Programming languages created by whites. Learning to do it in Universities created by white. Unbelievable. And if you want the real reason that Asians are overrepresented is because it&rsquo;s the only way for tech companies to increase their diversity and still get people that can actually program.</p>

<p>In North East Asia they started using mobile-based payment systems in the early 2000&rsquo;s, and by the middle of the last decade you could already stream lots of hd tv content on your mobile platform.</p>
<p>Also they pioneered several ads models (like interactive product placement) on mobile devices as well. In general the service sector in any developed East Asian economy makes Europe look and feel positively medieval.</p>
<p>Asia is rife with business innovations, what Asians don&rsquo;t do and will never do (sorry if i repeat myself) is theoretical science.</p>

Hiring people of color born overseas does nothing to advance the interests of people of color born in this nation. Using their own logic, by hiring those on the immigrant track they are discriminating against people of color born in this nation. It&rsquo;s probably a matter of ethics, though. As long as a certain number of white men are replaced, or X amount of color is added to the mix, it&rsquo;s A-OK to discriminate against those of color born in this nation. It&rsquo;s all about a &#8216;greater good&rsquo;.</p>

It may be that whites are more creative and entrepreneurial where as asians are better at cranking out the code for a defined problem. Your theory that Asians are over represented to increase diversity doesn&rsquo;t hold up. If it were so, you would see this phenomenon in other fields. Asian dominance doesn&rsquo;t apply outside of the technical/engineering type fields. Which suggests to me innate group superiority for those types of skills.</p>

I find you harsh about yourself sometimes. You are an individual, and a good one too, you are not responsible for the actions of the others. It is brave and honest to be a race realist but you need to be happy and live too.</p>
<p>You have good genes in intellect and character. Once I would have advise you to find a good black man or one of those white men who want to marry a black woman (as anyway, he would marry one but at least you would make him a race realist) but now I don&rsquo;t think the second part anymore because:</p>
<p>a) it is not fair for the (mixed) children, I think now strongly that children need an identity and to belong to the familial group, that miscegenation is hurting them the most, even if it is now promoted: I think that eventually older, it will sadden them or anger them. </p>
<p>b) it is not fair for yourself/family: like for all races, it is better and natural to want children that look like your parent. </p>
<p>c) It is not fair for your race. Your race need more like you.</p>
<p>d) It is not fair for us. If you really like the white race, for various reason, from being principled to being hesperophil (if I coined the word, cool), then you would want that white guy to marry a white girl and make white kids.</p>
<p>e) You are a race realist, not a White race realist although you are pro-white. People like you will be allies and hopefully will be the leaders of your people. Hopefully one day, the world will come back from the insanity and suicide of multiculturalism/racialism, that actually destroy diversity, that is the beautiful and needed product of thousands of years of evolution, and I hope there will be race realist nations that can live beside each others, eventually/realistically/sadly after the war(s)). That is pro-white or at least not anti-white non-whites.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-638429" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The reasons for the prevalence of Ice People in STEM goes back to what<br/>
their ancestors were doing 20,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The northern Ice Peoples evolved in a<br/>
harsh environment that selected for future orientation, organization,<br/>
cooperation, and high parental investment (&#8216;R-k theory&rsquo;). Thus producing races<br/>
of people who are puzzle solvers and puzzle makers; busybodies who even plan in<br/>
their sleep and play the role of worry wart in their waking hours.</p>
<p>The abundant environment of Sun Peoples, the<br/>
theory goes, would have selected for just the opposite. No need to plan,<br/>
for all you need is within arms reach and it will still be there tomorrow or a<br/>
month from tomorrow; No need to organize if there is no need to plan for coming<br/>
difficulties; Insular and territorial peoples would find it dangerous to<br/>
cooperate with outsiders - they will see what you have and if they have none<br/>
you will become their prey. To avoid violence you keep your relatives<br/>
close in a small village - everyone else stays away if they know what&rsquo;s good<br/>
for them. Educate the young to do what? Instinct tells us all we<br/>
need here in the land of plenty.</p>
<p>If your ancestors didn&rsquo;t need to use their<br/>
noodle all that much to survive or to live a comfortable life it would not have<br/>
become a necessary and thus common and rewarded trait among Sun Peoples.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>On the other hand, it is the very openness of<br/>
Ice People and their eagerness to cooperate that sets the stage for their own<br/>
destruction when they open up their societies to Sun Peoples. &#8220;If<br/>
they would just act like us they would reap &hellip;&#8221; Sure it will.﻿</p>
<p>Democracy makes this problem not only worse but explosive. In a<br/>
democracy with universal suffrage the only possible explanation in the public<br/>
arena for this disparity is not nature but SIN - racism. Spend trillions<br/>
of dollars trying to redeem this sin and still zilch changes. The<br/>
fallback position then becomes -&#8221; Yowza! The sin is even deeper and more<br/>
malignant that we thought. It must be so pervasive that it is an integral<br/>
part of the culture&#8221; - thus we get the venial sin of White Privilege. It<br/>
will never end until we leave the realm of fantasy in which all individuals and<br/>
groups are clones. The chance that this will occur without a violent breakdown in the social order is infinitesimal. The current state of affairs in elites vs. citizen is succinctly explained by Baron Bodissey in a 3 part series - well worth reading.</p>

Asians have benefitted copiously from White munificence towards non-Whites, as their numbers in the tech industry evidence. Blacks/Hispanics are underrepresented in the tech industry due to their lack of ability, not White racism. If we would just return to the common sense racial realism of the old days, White Americans would not waste time worrying about trying to alter that which is natural. We don&rsquo;t see any Asians clamoring about their underrepresentation in the ranks of professional basketball or football players. The reason is lack of White guilt+intelligence. In the old days, when our elites were composed of racial realist Whites, a Negro buffoon like Jessie Jackson was not afforded a listening ear by White America. He was channeled into a janitorial position that appropriately matched his intellect. </p>

In this day and age (where we need it more than ever) a white leader would be shocking, and would be reviled.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-639287" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Great video! I wish Dr Watson hadn&rsquo;t caved in after his comments that resulted in losing his job at Cold Spring Harbor, but in many ways we are trapped in this bizarro world of untruth. Every intelligent mature adult knows that negroes are cognitively deficient. Or at least every one who has had any exposure to them. The excuses for their lack of performance just don&rsquo;t explain it after trillions of dollars spent in remedial efforts. </p>
<p>The fundamental problem is how to get from here to there. How to go from fantasy to Truth. Businessmen are pragmatists. They know that speaking Truth will get them fired, cause them loss of market share and revenue, or both. They also know that even if they banded together and spoke with a single voice, the outcry against them would be deafening. They&rsquo;d all be fired together. </p>
<p>We have created a world where Truth is unthinkable. The very thing that separates Man from Beast is intelligence. Every human achievement of any importance is possible only because of intelligence. So important is intelligence that we create consolation prizes for banal achievements like running fast or jumping high and pass them out to those who will never see achievement of an intellectual sort. This, of course proven by the fact that intellect has built machines that can run impossibly faster and jump impossibly higher than Man ever could physically. Indeed, the importance of intelligence is so profound and so central to Man&rsquo;s nature and his objective value that we simply cannot bear to face the fact that some tribes of man are permanently and unalterably severely handicapped in this regard. The implications of this knowledge are so great we must banish it from our thoughts and spend whatever price necessary to pretend it does not exist. Even if half our Gross Domestic Product were consumed in hiding this Truth we would pay it. Those who speak the unspeakable Truth are heretics who must be silenced or banished or forced to recant. </p>
<p>What would it mean if Man were to openly acknowledge the Truth that untold hundred of millions were fundamentally incapable of achieving even the most basic of cognitive accomplishments? To know that perhaps a billion are incapable of abstract or even intermediate thought? That entire languages have no terms for &#8220;how high&#8221; or &#8220;how many,&#8221; no mathematics, no physics, no grasp of gravity? That they have no written language at all and only the barest minimal ability to learn a written language provided to them?</p>
<p>While Man looks to the stars, while he contemplates and plans to leave behind the bonds of Earth, he cannot face the Truth that exists here. In his video, Jared displays a graphic showing IQ distribution around the world. Vast expanses with a billion population have IQs under 70. 70! Smart enough perhaps to know which end of a broom to push. Smart enough to count to ten or maybe remember the alphabet twice in five attempts. Reach for the stars? These souls are fortunate to tie their own shoelaces or find shelter in a rainstorm! How can we face this terrible Truth!?! That even here in America, with the most advanced technology the world has seen, we have 50 million or more who will never become fully literate and couldn&rsquo;t begin to guess whether Earth was closer to the Moon, the Sun, Mars, or Venus. And yet we are within a few years of commercial space flight!!</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s much much more than simply admitting a truth that we face. This Truth reaches to the very core of what it means to be Man. And sadly, the more time that passes the more vast will be this insurmountable chasm between the highest and lowest. At some point I know the Truth must be faced, but I think we should all reflect deeply on what that day of reckoning will look like. </p>

When the American car companies began hiring Negroes en masse, the assembly quality of American cars became abysmal. Up until this point, American cars had excellent build quality. I speak from personal experience with this. My comments on the Black influence on America&rsquo;s moral downslide are equally accurate. Rock N&rsquo; Roll introduced Negro culture to White youth, introducing the notion of fornication as cool instead of shameful. The divorce epidemic you describe began as the Rock N&rsquo; Roll generation of Whites reached adulthood. Their attitudes towards sex were more in line with traditional Negro attitudes towards sex instead of those of their parents. I don&rsquo;t blame Negroes for all of our social ills. I have a clear and realistic view, though, of how Whites viewing them falsely as our equals, and adopting elements of Negro culture and psychology, have done massive damage to White European cultures. </p>

He said he would never buy a FORD because he saw how they were built. The assembly quality of American cars was in the toilet for a long time before blacks started working there. Henry Ford treated his white workers like garbage. Same as Carnegie Steel and Rockefeller (Standard Oil - Chevron). The only difference back then was that a skilled person could still go off on his own and start a new business. Things weren&rsquo;t outrageously expensive. </p>
<p>P.S. Most younger whites in the 1950&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t think they should have to work because they beat the evil Nazis who wanted to take over the world. They felt they should be allowed to sit on the backside and be served by the losers. Little did they know that they were the real losers.</p>

You may not see it clearly yet, but Negrophilia is a key factor in why your peers are this way. With age, one gains perspective on life. Rap culture was not yet around in my teen and college years. Racially mixed dating was still rare. Most White students were tolerant of Blacks who behaved with some couth, but we had no use for thug behavior. We also had little desire to embrace Black culture. White kids being hooked on gangster rap culture, which leads to smoking marijuana, constantly getting in fights, and seeking meaningless recreational sex is just one example of why young Whites are an embarrassment. In the days of segregation, Whites, by and large, were hard working and had a strong moral compass. White youth thinking Negro behaviors are cool has been the major cause behind our moral and cultural degradation. This began with Elvis and Rock N&rsquo; Roll, which coincided with integration. </p>

I&rsquo;ve had to work with Black co-workers, though, who are not intelligent enough for their positions. They have their positions due to AA. Though it is not a part of their job, they are constantly engaging in needless, OCD style cleaning. Observing this constant cleaning from the same individuals who are constantly slacking off and performing poorly at the tasks they are supposed to be focusing on, which results in increased work load for their White co-workers, I can&rsquo;t help but to see the wisdom in the hiring practices of yesteryear, when Blacks were channeled into janitorial/maid service work. Blacks love to clean. They are good at it.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-644378" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>First off, I&rsquo;ve heard OCD style obsessive cleanliness can be a sign of Sociopathic Personality Disorder. Blacks are also often more obsessed with their clothing than whites- wearing new clothing, ironing their clothes, etc. They are more obsessed with appearances in general, but clearly not the outer appearances of their neighborhoods. I think they throw garbage out of their cars a lot because they like to keep their new, leased cars clean inside. I&rsquo;ve had many black roommates and most were clean, as were the asians. Poor people also have fewer things to organize and are more likely to appreciate the things they do have and keep them clean and this provides order in their life too. Of course, there are opposite extremes of all of this, like slovenly white trash or whatever, but I have noticed this. A lot of rich girls can be pretty messy&hellip;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-648141" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yes excessive cleanliness is one sign of sociopathy, but not all sociopaths are excessively clean, and not all clean freaks are sociopaths. Sociopaths seem to be excessively clean when it comes to THEIR OWN food and external appearance, but when it comes to sex they will have unprotected sex with a street hooker or bar fly. (still sounds like blacks)</p>
<p>Most blacks are not sociopaths even though they are excessively clean and show a lot of traits of sociopathy. They are most likely Narcissistic psychopaths. Blacks probably have the highest rate of Narcissism out of any group.</p>
<p>Blacks do not understand the difference between looking like something and being something. They think if they look rich, then they should be rich. They think if they look like a doctor or engineer, they can be one. This is why blacks get so frustrated and angry when whites won&rsquo;t hire them. They are living a cargo-cult life. </p>
<p>Primitive tribes on Islands in the South Pacific would build wooden planes and march in large groups in open fields hoping the magic metal birds (planes) would land and give them free gifts. Blacks dress up in fancy clothes and drive around expensive cars, and think they should get hired because the look the part. They have no way to comprehend what needs to be done because they can&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-650965" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Asians certainly are, on the whole, a somewhat better class of people than Blacks and Mexicans, but that depends on the Asian.</p>
<p>Where I live the lively, vibrant Hmong are absolutely horrible. They are easily as bad as Mexicans when it comes to major crime, bad judgement and just plain crappy behavior.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese are no great shakes either. A large proportion of them are heavily gang affiliated.</p>
<p>Pacific Islanders are soft of like a cross between a Mexican and a Black. In other words exactly like a Mexican and a Black.</p>
<p>Apart from the exceptions that prove the rule, these South Asians are just as big of a problem as the more parasitic Blacks and Mexicans. The Asians do tend to hold a job better except for the Hmong; they are generally wards of the state to some degree.</p>
<p>The North Asians; Koreans, Japanese and Northern Chinese are pretty good people. I like them, but they have no business flocking to this country in substantial numbers. We don&rsquo;t need them and we certainly don&rsquo;t want them.</p>
<p>Even the much vaunted northern Asians with their marginally higher IQs than Whites have never been particularly innovative or socially advanced. The entire history of Asia has an infinitely more brutal level of tyranny than the European.</p>
<p>Asians invented a good many things, but never really developed them in pre-modern times like the Europeans did. The development of gunpowder weapons and highly-sophisticated sailing ships by Europeans is an unbelievably interesting story. The North Asians had all the same pieces in their hands, but did relatively little with them. Regarding the European guns and ships it was a story of constant little improvements, unceasing little tweaks and then sudden massive breakthroughs. Only among Europeans did that kind of thing happen. AND the Europeans always created superior organization and doctrine to use their new inventions than the Asians ever did.</p>
<p>Even in the modern era Asians have invented virtually nothing of fundamental importance. They are very good at taking White inventions and improving them in some respects; especially in manufacturing techniques, but even today the inventions and innovations are still coming almost exclusively from Whites.</p>
<p>And there is a reason that even the Northern Asians are still coming to the U.S. It is because they have ruined their countries to a greater or lesser extent. The overpopulation alone is horrendous and they will do the same here. And as I mentioned, Asians seem to be more or less addicted to tyranny. Even the relatively benign Japaneses government is still incredibly oppressive and intrusive by White standards.</p>
<p>The fact is that Asians vote for the Leftist pathology just as much as Blacks, Mexicans and Jews do. We need no more of those people for any reason.</p>
