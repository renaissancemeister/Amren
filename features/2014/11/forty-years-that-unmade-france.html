<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Eric Zemmour, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.fr/Le-Suicide-fran%C3%A7ais-Eric-Zemmour/dp/2226254757/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415128187&amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;keywords=suuicide+francais">Le Suicide Français</a></em>, Editions Albin Michel, 2014, 527 pp. (softcover only, in French), €22.90.</strong></p>
<p>Eric Zemmour is a well-known French author and television personality. Of Algerian-Jewish origin, he may seem an unlikely spokesman for French tradition, but he has emerged in recent years as a prominent scourge of ideological orthodoxy. He is unquestionably the most prominent mainstream French commentator who speaks candidly about race.</p>
<p>This role comes with a price. In 2011 he was convicted of &ldquo;incitement to racial hatred&rdquo; for pointing out that most drug dealers in France are blacks and Arabs. He was again convicted of the same offense for maintaining that employers should be able to hire as they see fit (i.e., to &ldquo;discriminate&rdquo;). This year, he has been prosecuted for remarks about the criminal behavior of ethnic gangs.</p>
<p>His latest book, <em>The Suicide of France</em>, was released on October 1st and immediately became the top seller in France, displacing a tell-all memoir by President François Hollande&rsquo;s former mistress. The book is a year-by-year chronicle of France&rsquo;s dissolution-everything from harmful legislation to pop songs and movies that reflect or promote decline.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Zemmour&rsquo;s principle themes is the role of free markets in promoting a present-oriented consumerist mentality that has squandered France&rsquo;s moral capital. However, he also laments the loss of will by native Frenchmen and their displacement by mostly-Muslim immigrants. He has clearly struck a chord among those who are angry at the psychological capitulation of the past 40 years.</p>
<p><strong>The beginning of the end</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Zemmour argues that four quite different developments in the 1970-1972 period set the stage for ongoing France&rsquo;s suicide. The first was a 1970 law that abolished paternal authority within the family in favor of &ldquo;parental authority&rdquo; shared between spouses. Fathers, in Mr. Zemmour&rsquo;s words:</p>
<blockquote><p>incarnate the law and the reality principle as against the pleasure principle. They channel and curb children&rsquo;s impulses in order to sublimate them. [But] fathers are an artificial, cultural creation who need society&rsquo;s support to overcome natural maternal power.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1970, they lost that support. Mr. Zemour also believes that giving the mother equal power in the household pushed France decisively away from saving and towards consumption.</p>
<p>The second crucial development was a 1971 decision by the Constitutional Council, which has the power to declare laws unconstitutional. This was a complex case, but was the first time the Council went beyond checking laws for conformity with a higher legal norm and censured a law politically because of its content. Thus did France, in Mr. Zemmour&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;unknowingly abandon the shores of the Republic and enter with eyes closed upon the bumpy road of government by judges.&rdquo; Americans are all too familiar with judges who seize legislative authority.</p>
<p>The third blow came in 1971 when President Nixon abolished the gold standard. This effectively nullified the Bretton Woods Agreement to which France was a signatory, and ushered in our current era of free-floating fiat currencies. Freed from the constraints of the gold standard, governments no longer worry about deficits. France has not had a balanced budget since 1981.</p>
<p>The fourth and final blow of this period was the so-called Pleven Law of 1972 (Socialists pushed it, but it is named after the Gaullist minister who adopted it), prohibiting &ldquo;provocation to discrimination, hatred or violence&rdquo; against persons or groups &ldquo;on the grounds of their origin or their membership or non-membership in a particular ethnic group, nation, race or religion.&rdquo; Passed unanimously amid much self-congratulation, this law, in Mr. Zemmour&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;introduces subjectivity where objectivity had prevailed; it condemns intentions and not acts; it gives judges the right and the duty to probe into people&rsquo;s hearts and souls, to dig up thoughts and ulterior motives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author emphasizes the significance of including &ldquo;nation&rdquo; among the protected categories. President Georges Pompidou was at that time bringing literally millions of foreign workers into France at the behest of the construction and automobile industries, and the Pleven law meant that no one could criticize their presence.</p>
<p>As Mr. Zemmour points out, the very concept of a nation requires discrimination-a determination that some people are &ldquo;us,&rdquo; while the rest are &ldquo;not us.&rdquo; Taken literally, a prohibition against making this distinction is incompatible with the continued existence of France, and in practice, the law is used to silence criticism of demographic displacement. As Mr. Zemmour has discovered, even citing verifiable facts can lead to a conviction.</p>
<p>The government made matters much worse by subcontracting the authority to prosecute under the Pleven law to private &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; organizations such as LICRA (French acronym of the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism) and MRAP (Movement Against Racism and for the Friendship between Peoples). &ldquo;By authorizing them to take legal action against any unguarded opinion,&rdquo; notes the author, &ldquo;the State has given them the right of political and financial life or death over all dissidents.&rdquo; Americans can imagine the consequences of giving the Southern Poverty Law Center the power to prosecute someone for any remark it did not like.</p>
<p>The Pleven law has been followed by other laws in the same spirit: the Gayssot law of 1990 against &ldquo;Holocaust denial,&rdquo; the Taubira law of 2001 defining the African slave trade as a &ldquo;crime against humanity&rdquo; and the Lellouche law of 2002 stiffening the penalties for &ldquo;racist and anti-Semitic offenses.&rdquo; As Mr. Zemmour notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beginning with the Pleven Law, a whole new field of sacred objects has arisen: immigration, Islam, homosexuality, the history of slavery, colonialism and the Second World War, the Nazi genocide of the Jews. A vast and varied domain that continues to grow, in order to satisfy all the minorities that consider themselves discriminated against.</p></blockquote>
<p>For future historians, notes Mr. Zemmour, &ldquo;freedom to think, write and express oneself will have been no more than a historical parenthesis of less than a century.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Demographic displacement</strong></p>
<p>One year after the Pleven law was passed, the oil crisis of 1973 dried up the demand for foreign workers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Logic would have dictated that a reverse flow be initiated. This is how the republic had acted during each economic crisis in order to protect &ldquo;national&rdquo; employment. Nothing was done by either right or left. This was the first essential break with the past, supposedly for humanitarian reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the French government went further, passing a &ldquo;family reunification&rdquo; law to bring the wives and children of North African workers to France. The result was that &ldquo;hundreds of thousands of women and children were pulled up from their villages and their modest but peaceful lives to rejoin husbands and fathers they hardly knew.&rdquo; Housing construction could not keep up, and shantytowns began to appear. Schools were overwhelmed and the quality of instruction for native French children sank as overworked teachers tried to teach Arabs to use toothbrushes and not to slaughter sheep in bathtubs.</p>
<p>In 1959, De Gaulle had warned his countrymen: &ldquo;The French are French. The Arabs are Arabs. Those who believe in integration have the brains of hummingbirds.&rdquo; Some politicians still understood this. In 1976, Prime Minister Raymond Barre tried to abolish family reunification, but was overruled by the State Council, which acts as the supreme court for administrative decisions. He then offered &ldquo;return aid&rdquo; of 10,000 francs to immigrants who agreed to go home. Spanish and Portuguese who were causing no problems took up the offer, while the North Africans at whom it was aimed stayed put. Barre then negotiated an agreement with the Algerian government for the repatriation of Algerians. Before its terms could be carried out, the Socialist François Mitterand was elected president and repudiated the agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Pop culture as sign of the times</strong></p>
<p>Popular culture quickly took up the immigrants&rsquo; cause. The movie <em>Dupont-Lajoie</em> (1975; English title <em>The Common Man</em>) featured hard-working Algerians consigned to ramshackle barracks as they build vacation homes for rich Frenchmen. Vacationers bully the workmen, suspecting them of having intentions on their daughters. A fight breaks out between the two groups, and the police arrest only the Algerians. Later, one particularly &ldquo;racist&rdquo; Frenchman murders a woman and tries to blame the Algerian workmen by depositing her corpse near their barracks. The movie&rsquo;s final scene shows one of the Algerians tracking down the principle French &ldquo;racist&rdquo; at a Paris bar and shooting him dead in righteous revenge.</p>
<p>The music business took up the cause of &ldquo;anti-racism&rdquo; with <em>Lily</em>, a song about a Somali girl who comes to France to empty trashcans. She is tormented by racists. She is turned away from a hotel in the <em>rue Secrétan</em> that &ldquo;only accepts whites.&rdquo; She falls in love with a French boy, but the family objects. She moves to America where she meets the great Angela Davis, but learns that blacks are not allowed to ride on buses. She marries and has a baby &ldquo;the color of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Lily</em> was issued as a B-side, but French disc jockeys made it a hit. Mr. Zemmour reports that journalists actually hurried to the <em>rue Secrétan </em>in search of the hotelier who turned away blacks; he was, of course, as fictional as the American buses restricted to whites. The lyrics of <em>Lily</em> are now &ldquo;studied&rdquo; as literature in French classrooms; questions about the song are sometimes even included in final exams at French secondary schools.</p>

<p><strong>The hunt for fascists</strong></p>
<p>On October 3, 1980, a bomb exploded outside a synagogue in the <em>rue Copernic</em> in Paris. The explosion had been timed to kill worshipers as they left the building, but the service ran late that day. Four bystanders were killed instead.</p>
<p>The attack was carried out by an Arab holding a forged Cypriot passport. He was sponsored by East European communists and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-but it took years to establish this.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the entire French left was convinced that the attack could only have been the work of the native French &ldquo;extreme right.&rdquo; A tiny group called the Federation for National and European Action actually claimed responsibility; only much later was it discovered that the message had come from an infiltrator. The police went in search of Spanish Francoists, but that trail lead nowhere. Jewish youth demonstrated in the streets and sacked the offices of one nationalist organization. Mr. Zemmour explains their mindset:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the Six Day War of June 1967, a fraction of French Jewish youth had enrolled in Zionist defense movements. They struck out against imaginary Nazis in the streets and universities … pretending they were in the underground with Jean Moulin [the famous Resistance fighter] or in the Warsaw ghetto.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shots were fired at the Paris headquarters of Oeuvre Française, another nationalist organization. Right-wing think-tanks such as GRECE and the Club d&rsquo;Horloge were denounced for &ldquo;contributing to the atmosphere&rdquo; in which such a crime could take place. Socialists screamed that the Gaullist President Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing was an &ldquo;accomplice of the murderers.&rdquo; Prime Minster Raymond Barre&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;this odious attack was aimed at Jews attending synagogue, but struck four innocent Frenchmen who were crossing the <em>rue Copernic</em>&rdquo; was unaccountably held up as proof he was an anti-Semite.</p>
<p>The hue and cry may have contributed to Socialist President François Mitterand&rsquo;s victory the following year. The truth came out only after the collapse of communism and the opening of the East German secret police files.</p>
<p>The bombing in the <em>rue Copernic</em> provided the standard script for responding to any future anti-Jewish attacks by Arabs:</p>
<blockquote><p>More than thirty years later, during the presidential campaign of 2012, [three] Jewish children were murdered in front of a religious school. Everyone denounced the fascist-racist-anti-Semite … The media looked for a tall, blond Nazi with a Kalashnikov.</p></blockquote>
<p>The killer was soon discovered to be an Arab with French citizenship but Mr. Zemmour notes that without missing a beat, the French media then started assuring the country that the crime in no way implicated the Muslims of France or their peaceful religion.</p>
<p><strong>Immigrant insurrection</strong></p>
<p>Unrest in immigrant neighborhoods began in a small way during the 1970s, but the election of François Mitterand, a Socialist, emboldened rioters. Certain they would not be sent home, young North Africans in the Minguettes neighborhood south of Lyon threw a Molotov cocktail at the automobile of the last policeman who lived in the area, shouting &ldquo;no more cops in the neighborhood!&rdquo; The officer moved out. This was the first widely reported example of the torching of automobiles, which became a standard form of immigrant &ldquo;protest.&rdquo; The government responded by creating recreation programs to serve the &ldquo;youth.&rdquo; The lesson was not lost on them: Violence was rewarded.</p>
<p>Following further riots in 1990, Mitterand established a formal Ministry for Urban Affairs in an attempt to buy social peace. Much money was also spent tearing down old buildings in immigrant neighborhoods and erecting new ones, or moving immigrants around from place to place. The very ineffectiveness of these policies was not the least of their attractions to France&rsquo;s bureaucrats, since it meant disbursements would never end.</p>
<p>Young immigrants have made a New Year&rsquo;s Eve tradition out of torching cars, though the total for every December 31 has come down to just over 1,000.</p>
<p><strong>SOS</strong><strong> Racism </strong></p>
<p>The anti-racist firmament of France received a new star in October 1984 with the establishment of SOS Racism.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was at the Elysée Palace [residence of the French President] in great secrecy that the association was formed. Political advisors and presidential spokesmen were involved, and Mitterand was at the helm. The misadventure of a young Black man, Diego, accused of theft in a subway train, was invented out of whole cloth and broadcast by all the media.</p></blockquote>
<p>SOS Racism went from triumph to triumph, attracting the endorsement of many popular entertainers and repeatedly stressing the alleged historical continuity between French distaste for African immigration and the Nazi persecution of the Jews. SOS Racism at one time hoped to displace older anti-racist groups such as LICRA and MRAP, but Mr. Zemmour believes that Arab suspicion of its heavily-Jewish leadership kept it from ever getting popular support.</p>
<blockquote><p>Without ground troops or any hold on the &#8216;street,&rsquo; the directors of SOS Racism fell back on their core activity, collecting [state] subsidies. They developed a form of media activism, using their incomparable Trotskyist <em>savoir-faire</em> to manipulate minds, becoming inquisitors of the anti-racist religion, preaching and catechizing on television, performing excommunications, privatizing the justice system for their own benefit like latter-day Torquemadas.</p></blockquote>
<p>The directors of SOS Racism have a well-earned reputation for living well, dining in the best Paris restaurants, and sporting high-priced designer watches and briefcases. Since most of their money comes from subsidies, the authorities have looked into some of this behavior, but so far there have been no convictions.</p>

<p><strong>The veil</strong></p>
<p>As ongoing demographic displacement of the native French became a taboo subject in the media, a comparatively trivial side issue occupied the headlines.</p>
<p>On September 18, 1989, three teenage girls were sent home from school for refusing to take off their Islamic veils in class. The case made international headlines, and 1,000 people demonstrated in Paris in support of the girls. The government avoided making any decision: The Minister of Education asked the Constitutional Council for a ruling, but this august body left the matter to the discretion of school teachers. The debate raged for <em>15 years</em>.</p>
<p>In 2004, President Jacques Chirac finally summoned the nerve to ban the veil in French classrooms. But a lot had happened in the meantime.</p>
<blockquote><p>As the Republic laboriously won the battle of the veil, it failed to notice that it had lost the battle of <em>halal</em> [ritual Muslim slaughter]. In neighborhoods where the Muslim population was becoming the majority, it imposed its cultural and religious dominion. The multiplication of <em>halal</em> butcher shops was the symptom of an Islamization from below which went far beyond mere culinary habits to affect every domain of existence: dress, language, sex, marriage, education, family …</p>
<p>The Republic had no sooner succeeded at great cost in limiting the fire at one spot when it immediately caught on in another. The veil, prohibited at school, was worn at work, in nursery schools; veiled mothers came to pick up their daughters at school; they demanded more or less violently that their children be served <em>halal</em> meat in the cafeteria, sometimes going so far as to demand tables separate from the &ldquo;infidels;&rdquo; pupils refused to learn certain subjects: Darwinism that rejects the sacred teaching of the Koran, the history of the Crusades, the unbelieving Voltaire, the unfaithful wife Mme Bovary, the Holocaust of the Jews who are murderers of Palestinians, etc. Girls could not take gym class; boys dropped out <em>en masse</em>; the rare good students were mocked as &#8216;Jews&rsquo; or &#8216;dirty Frenchmen.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>All of this happens with the blessing of the French left, which continues to imagine that Muslim immigrants will one day give up Islam to join them in worshiping the goddess Reason.</p>
<p><strong>The &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>In June 1996, 300 illegal immigrants-mostly black Africans-occupied the Church of Saint Bernard in Paris to demand &ldquo;regularization.&rdquo; In their eyes, they were not at fault for entering France illegally; it was France that was at fault for not giving them permission. They set up sleeping pallets, urinated and defecated inside the church, and created a great deal of disorder.</p>
<p>French movie starlets and highly-placed administrators showed up to be photographed lending support to the protest-but preferred to go home at night to their own homes. Mr. Zemmour notes that for the crowds supporting them, the Africans variously represented latter-day Jews being persecuted by French successors to the Nazis, formerly colonized persons to whom reparations were due, persecuted Christ figures, noble savages innocent of the moral and ecological contamination for which civilization is responsible, or exploited proletarians who had become agents of revolution. For the captains of industry, meanwhile, they represented low-wage replacements for French workers.</p>
<p>Eight weeks later, on August 23, the security police cleared out the church and shipped at least some of the Africans home. They became martyrs and the anniversary of the raid has been commemorated by French &ldquo;anti-racists&rdquo; ever since.</p>
<p><strong>Le Pen makes the second round</strong></p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2002, France was governed by Gaullist (conservative) President Jacques Chirac, but parliamentary elections had resulted in a left-leaning legislature with a Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin. This arrangement, which the French call &ldquo;cohabitation,&rdquo; pleased nobody. In the Presidential election of 2002, president and prime minster ran against each another. Neither man was popular. President Chirac, embroiled in a financial scandal, received less than twenty percent of the vote-a humiliation for an incumbent. His prime minster, opposed by half a dozen other leftist parties, picked up just sixteen percent of the vote.</p>
<p>The result was that with 17 percent, Jean Marie Le Pen of the National Front came in ahead of all leftist candidates and faced President Chirac in the second round of the election. That election was scheduled for two weeks later. As Mr. Zemmour explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each evening, televisions broadcast archive images retracing the Nazis&rsquo; rise to power, the extermination of the Jews, and the Second World War. Schoolchildren poured into the streets, encouraged when not obligated by their teachers, [shouting] &#8216;Le Pen must be burned.&rsquo; The propaganda apparatus worked at full tilt. The entire political class called for a vote for Chirac &#8216;in order to set a roadblock to fascism.&rsquo; Every union, every company, every authority appealed to save the Republic: bishops, rabbis, imams, professional athletes, actors, magistrates, attorneys, free masons, the anti-racist leagues, the homosexual movement, even Judge Halphen [who was investigating President Chirac for financial misdeeds] added his little appeal!</p></blockquote>
<p>The only man to retain his sanity was France&rsquo;s outgoing Socialist prime minster, who later acknowledged that the country had never experienced any fascist threat, that the National Front was not a fascist party, and that the whole pretence had been nothing but political theater.</p>
<p>On May 5, left-wing voters showed up at polling stations with clothespins on their noses to choose the merely conservative Gaullist candidate over the supposed fascist. Crook or not, Jacques Chirac was reconfirmed as President of the Republic with 82 percent of the vote. The propaganda onslaught had succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>The suburbs burn</strong></p>
<p>On October 27, 2005, two teenagers in Clichy-sous-bois, a suburb of Paris populated almost entirely by African immigrants, fled from a police car making its usual rounds. It is unknown whether they had something to hide or simply wanted to avoid a possibly time-consuming encounter with the police. They hid in a large electrical transformer, where they were electrocuted.</p>
<p>The usual riots broke out. Cars, buses, schools, and gyms were torched. But this time the violence did not stop after a few nights. &ldquo;Molotov cocktails, manhole covers and washing machines were thrown from the tops of apartment buildings,&rdquo; writes the author, since &ldquo;all means were fair for chasing away the helmeted enemy-the French police.&rdquo; Televised images of the riots became models for immigrants in other suburbs, and the violence spread to more than 274 French towns. &ldquo;There were no organizers, no representatives, no slogans, no demands, no ideology or party: only the joy of destruction and fighting.&rdquo; It was an impressive record: 8,973 cars burned, 2,888 arrests, 126 police and firefighters injured, two people killed. Mr. Zemmour reports that the damage was estimated to have cost €200 million.</p>
<p>French Minister of the Interior Nicolas Sarkozy had coincidentally chosen the day before the teenagers were electrocuted to speak to the French inhabitants of another Paris suburb plagued by immigrant lawlessness: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had enough of this riffraff (<em>racaille</em>) haven&rsquo;t you? We&rsquo;re going to get rid of them for you.&rdquo; The French political establishment, especially his own party, panicked and denounced him. Yet the celebrated riffraff remark-quietly supported by millions of ordinary Frenchmen-may have been responsible for Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s election to the French presidency in 2007. President Sarkozy had five years to deliver on his promise, but when he stepped down the riffraff were still there.</p>
<p><strong>Today and tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>They are there to this day, warns Mr. Zemmour, and growing in number. The suburbs where they live are governed not by French officials but by Islamic <em>caïds</em> (leaders) who apply sharia law-including the death penalty. The only limits to <em>caïd</em> power are set by powerful drug lords no one can afford to offend.</p>
<p>The media report that hundreds of &ldquo;Frenchmen&rdquo; have gone to Syria to fight for the Islamic State.</p>
<p>Opposition to the present French regime and the demographic replacement it has promoted is agonizingly slow to gather-but it is gathering. In 2012, Marine Le Pen did slightly better in the presidential elections than her father had ever done, and her popularity continues to increase: In the late summer of 2014, polls showed that if elections were held today, she would be elected president of France.</p>
<p>The success of Mr. Zemmour&rsquo;s book is itself a sign of hope; at the French Amazon site, it has slipped to number two, but only behind a silly €3.00 pamphlet that makes fun of motherhood. It is miles ahead of anything else that even remotely resembles thoughtful non-fiction. <em>The Suicide of France</em> can be seen as a French counterpart to Thilo Sarrazin&rsquo;s bestselling 2010 book, <em>Germany Abolishes Itself</em>.</p>
<p>Mr. Zemmour himself makes no predictions and offers no solutions. The question remains whether patriotic opposition can overthrow the current establishment in time to save the historic French nation-or even to head off a bloody civil war.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-654818" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good question; I think the idea of an inalienable right is one which is inherent in being human. True enough, governments and tyrants, among other entities, can deny those rights, but that does not negate their existence. Also true that we must individually and collectively, through righteous government, defend those rights.</p>
<p>The defense of these unalienable rights was the very core of the concept of the founding of the American government, the right to life, liberty, and the &#8220;pursuit of happiness&#8221;. The &#8220;pursuit of happiness&#8221; was originally included as &#8220;property&#8221;, which shows the importance that the founders put on the &#8220;right&#8221; to own property. </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>One big thing she could do if in power - push to promote freedom of expression and end censorship. Give the FRENCH the right to express their beliefs without fear of governmental oppression.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Silly rabbit. &#8216;Inclusivism&rsquo; is the means by which a government reduces everyone to group labels as an attempt to own them. As soon as you expand the group to individuals able to claim their own choice of agency, you have no control over anyone.</p>
<p>Democracies have happened that way. :-]</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>The fourth and final blow of this period was the so-called Pleven Law of 1972 (Socialists pushed it, but it is named after the Gaullist minister who adopted it), prohibiting &#8220;provocation to discrimination, hatred or violence&#8221; against persons or groups &#8220;on the grounds of their origin or their membership or non-membership in a particular ethnic group, nation, race or religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>In 1972, what the French did to themselves was illegal because the only group not protected under &#8216;anti-nationalist defamation&rsquo; law was the French themselves. White. European. Smart. Civil. Natives of their own homeland.</p>
<p>Overturning Pleven now means nothing because &#8216;to be French&rsquo; is no longer a matter of culture that increasingly looks impossible for blacks and Southwest Asians to assimilate into.</p>
<p>It is about a legal piece of paper.</p>
<p>This should have been obvious when the Muslims began setting up micro-Stans in French Arrondissements whose laws were not those of the nation of France but of Sharia.</p>
<p>Note how this revolution began.</p>
<p>First we seed (or is that cede?) rule making to an obscure &#8216;rules and procedures&rsquo; group. (YKW throughout btw. The Rothschild quote &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care who writes the laws&hellip;&#8221; is a fabrication, Jews _always_ exert their pernicious influence through bureaucratic access).</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Next came the endorsement if not outright creation of victim groups (note, by 1970s the French had long since recovered from their WWII population depletions [which were never as severe as Germany or Britain&rsquo;s anyway] so importing foreign factory workers becomes about empowering white French cutouts to do the wrong thing &#8216;for economic reasons&rsquo; rather than any real need for EEC productivity expansion) and the creation of a privatized shadow government which could winnow out and punish the evil racists.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Nobody ever having asked if racism served a useful evolutionary psychology purpose.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Next we have the degeneration of those victim groups, probably with coaching, certainly with importation of known agitators and bad apples, into conditions where they act like Barbary Pirates, commiting crime until paid not to in the third oldest industry: the Protection Racket.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Atop the AntiRa legislation, this forces &#8216;negotiation with a known threat to the state&rsquo; and tires out the victim population, doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>All the while &#8216;Lilly&rsquo; plays along to make people think it&rsquo;s all real.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Finally, as the third generation of welfare dependents with no natural role in society and no reason to respect the French for simply letting them be born, come into their own, you have &#8216;nameless riots&rsquo; without ANY association by organization or attempt by governance, to stop the assault on society itself.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>And so arises a savior, as an ideal. Whose first emissary is denounced only to be proven Martyred Right (as opposed to Loony Left). And their successor becomes the convenient throwaway totem for all that will come to be seen as horrific and/or artificial when they are &#8216;Normalized&rsquo; out of existence, like the Romanovs (Marine Le Pen has a lousy and short future, in all likelihood).</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>And thus you are positioned for a globalist revolution as the &#8216;only choice remaining, however delusional, must be true&rsquo;.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Watch this video-</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Yuri Bezmenov On The Theory Of Subversion</p>
<p>https://www[dot]youtube[dot]com/watch?v=rNXmjhHZaY8</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>And see if you don&rsquo;t agree.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>First you Demoralize (which is easy to do in France as a country left out of the chivalric bloodfest of WWII as an occupied state, leading to radicalism by youth as the departure point from all the tradition which made them look bad).</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Then you Destabilize (Remember, French problems began with Labor Relations issues as the opening of a breach of trust between the governed and the governors over who had their best interests at heart).</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Then you push for a Crisis (Initially by pandering to the enemy group&rsquo;s occupational disruption, then by ignoring everyone as you let their predatory overrun go unanswered. Then by designating a &#8216;Hero&rsquo; to save the masses from their trust in the Old Guard.)</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Finally, by Normalization. (In which the heroes get shot and the people really responsible for the subversion effort step forth with the real agenda of their initial actions as group control mechanisms so tight they are all but undefeatable because they are based on Machiavellian Divide Et Empera tactics that leave balkanized ethnic and class micro populations who have no choice but to accept their own piece of the pie. Because they hate each other too much to overthrow their new conquerors.)</p>
<p>Please, TELL ME this isn&rsquo;t what is happening. Here and in France. Tell me that this isn&rsquo;t a massive effort to overturn our societies in favor of barbaric primitivism so that the &#8216;salvation&rsquo; which is offered can be seen as a &#8216;Better Red Than Dead&rsquo; alternative?</p>
<p>Because I think that&rsquo;s exactly what is happening. With remote control by far away globalist design the intended outcome. And the Banks and the Church letting it happen so that they can step in to have their piece of the pie when it all comes tumbling down. And feudalism is reborn as the caring of the many by a self-elected few.</p>
<p>This is what the Elites plan for us. And the YKW are at their head. It is evil beyond comprehension because it rolls back the first true democratic ideal of control BY the governed in over 2,000 years. We are just throwing it all away.</p>

Of course France will also become an Islamic state at an indterminate date somewhat later than that.<br/>
It is astonishing to note that in 1945, France hardly had a third world origin population to speak of.<br/>
The moral to be drawn is that the cowardice and incompetence of politicians, when they deliberately ignore impending danger, to give themselves an easy life, or when they pursue insane policies based on insane political/economic dogma, has very, very heavy consequences.<br/>
Another sad fact is that the European nations that have not, yet, embarked on this immigration madness, but which undoubtedly soon will, have learned absolutely damned nothing from the ongoing French disaster.</p>

<p>The media, like back then, is trying is best to trash her and her party. But since then, France has changed. The youth are being harrassed by the immigrants and now this happens even in the little towns and villages. Towns with 5&rsquo;000 inhabitants have no-go zones!!! Immigrants are not only in the big cities anymore&hellip; Beside the worsening of the economic problems that is forcing more and more French to emigrate. </p>
<p>Also between the two, only Marine addresses straightforward messages to the French workers they can understand and rely to now (unlike those of her father) and her plans are simple: French should get what they need before everyone else, French should get back to the way it was etc (It&rsquo;s almost if not exactly the messages of George Marchais, the French communist by excellence, before they communists went we-are-the-world bs) Melancholy works better when the situation is so dire, and that for so long. </p>

Even if all third world immigration into France was to cease absolutely and permanently from tomorrow, then the enormous numbers already inside France, and their prodigious fertility will ensure the certainty of a non White majority France by 2100 at the very latest.<br/>
Possibly only compulsory race based repatriation might just save France. But not even Mme Le Pen advocates this, and it is exceedingly unlikely to happen under any conceivable circumstances.</p>

The very best thing that can be salvaged from this disaster is this - France should, if intelligent politicians actually existed - be regarded as a physical concrete moral object lesson the danger of political cowardice and stupidity.

First of all, Obama&rsquo;s banana republic presidency has been pushing white people further and further to the right. Second, the South could exist as a full fledged nation entirely on its own and we to this day consider ourselves different from Yankees, Californians, etc. And, of course, Southern white men are the backbone of the United States military. So we have wildcard potential. Don&rsquo;t write us off yet.</p>

<p>The South isn&rsquo;t going to rise again. The natives like the GOP and the GOP likes cheap labor and globalism. Southerners are not going to hold the GOP to any kind of high standard vis a vis an ethnostate; the Yankees would oppose it and they live there now, with money and means to put down any kind of upstart, atavistic movement for independence. </p>
<p>And to be fair to Yankees: They&rsquo;ve done a lot to lift the South up economically, but I worry they will return to their backsliding ways. More traditionally Southern states are looking purplish.</p>

In the last 25 years of capitalism Poland most other central european countries have closed the economic gap considerably. They still have a ways to go certainly but most economic predictions I have read put economic convergence between eastern/central Europe and western Europe at about 2040-2050. </p>
<p>To give you some idea. In 1991 when Poland implement a free market economy its average GDP per capita (PPP) when compared with western Europe was about 33%. 25 years down the line its about 70% or so. This is the case for most of the former communist countries such as the Czech republic, Slovakia, the baltic states etc. Ukraine and Belarus are the exceptions but their fate has been quite different then ours since the fall of communism. </p>
<p>Having said all this predicting future economics is always very difficult as so many things can happen. </p>
<p>For example a war with Russia breaks out and economic progress is stalled considerably.</p>

They know all too well what it means to be stripped of your culture, a situation which we are only starting to understand now under the tutelage of our multiculturistic Cultural Marxist betters and the hordes of third-world immigrants they&rsquo;ve invited into our countries. </p>
<p>I would imagine that capitalism (globalism) also plays a substantial role in eroding national consciousness and tradition but that&rsquo;s an argument for another day. </p>
<p>Who knows, maybe being stuck behind the Iron Curtain and isolated from capitalism all those years will ultimately be a positive for Eastern Europe? They&rsquo;re in the fortunate position of still possessing national consciousness and pride we can only dream of, while being able to fully evaluate the more negative aspects of our current worship of globalizing capitalism. </p>

The work was given out to contractors who recruited workers in Algeria. The railroad improvement was probably the major motivation for the Pleven law. And of course more and more high rise projects and roads, sewers, utilities, schools, shopping centers and government offices had to be built to server the inhabitants of the projects. It was a bonanza for the building industry but a disaster for French construction workers because Pleven Algerians were hired.</p>

<p>As for clustering with other Jewish populations rather than the other north African that surround, that wouldn&rsquo;t be very surprising, since the Jews, until recently, have always married in, whether in Europe or elsewhere. So it&rsquo;s possible he&rsquo;s tenth- or fifteenth- generation North African <strong>and</strong> closer to, say, Ashkenazi Jews. He does look like a (slightly darker) typical European Jew.</p>

<p>During my journey in Race realism, I wondered if the IQs of the Ashkanaz Jews could be linked with the IQs of the Ancient Romans, i.e. that the people are related. This seems to me more logic than to think their IQs has be boosted because of a tiny minority of bankers, moreover in such a short time. </p>
<p>My speculation seems backed by Wade&rsquo;s article and Razib Khan&rsquo;s article &#8220;Genetics &amp; the Jews&#8221; in DiscoverMagazine:</p>
<p>&#8220;During Greco-Roman times, recorded mass conversions led to 6 million people practicing Judaism in Roman times or up to 10% of the population of the Roman Empire. Thus, the genetic proximity of these European/Syrian Jewish populations, including Ashkenazi Jews, to each other and to French, Northern Italian, and Sardinian populations favors the idea of non-Semitic Mediterranean ancestry in the formation of the European/ Syrian Jewish groups and is incompatible with theories that Ashkenazi Jews are for the most part the direct lineal descendants of converted Khazars or Slavs. The genetic proximity of Ashkenazi Jews to southern European populations has been observed in several other recent studies. Early history matters, and what these findings point to is that a division between western and eastern Jews which falls along the lines of Roman-Persian political division exists today even after 2,000 years. In terms of both culture and genetics there is &ldquo;first mover&rdquo; advantage. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>So after 500 A.D. it seems that what may have occurred was that a Jewish Diaspora characterized by geographically determined genetic diversity, despite some common original Levantine origin, was genetically isolated from surrounding populations. This explains why there seems relatively little influx of Slavic genes into the Ashkenazim despite their long sojourn within Poland-Lithuania and later the Russian, Empire. In contrast, the Roman Jewish community was already large in the days of Julius Caesar, and presumably intermarried with the urban proletariat of diverse origins.In an ironic twist these data suggest that modern Jews, in particular the Ashkenazim, but to a lesser extent the Sephardim as well, share common ancestry with gentile Europeans due to the unconstrained character of the pagan Greco-Roman world which Jews were to a great extent strident critics of. Contra Tertullian Athens had much to do with Jerusalem.&#8221;</p>

They were plenty of very dark Indians in England at the time, not immigrants but visitors. There were also a fair number of American black entertainers Josephine Baker, Brick top I don&rsquo;t know her real name and a famous jazz musician named Hutchinson I believe. There were usually several thousand black Americans in Europe in the 1930&rsquo;s, mostly entertainers but students and expats happy to be away from segregation.<br/>
Over the years I remember many posters claimed that French people are not White either as well as the Italians and Spanish.</p>

<p>It seems nowadays Southern Europeans are more nationalistic, family and ethnic oriented. Maybe also they know what miscegenation has done to their DNA, when they mixed with their slaves (Ancient Romans/Greeks/Spanish/Portuguese) or were raped during the centuries of jihadi occupations.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve found the problem here (and the authorities have condemned it): not the bad behavior but someone White noticing. Or someone White.</p>
<p>But wait till immigrants team up with conservatives in the home countries.</p>
<p>In the words of our own John PM: God let it be so.</p>

I think they have concocted in their minds this beautiful concept of &#8220;négritude&#8221;, that is completely unreal. Perhaps a reflex of Rousseaus&rsquo;s &#8220;le bon sauvage&#8221;. Or better: the &#8220;négritude&#8221; was perfect when Negroes/and Arabs stayed home, seen as far as possible. Now they roam French streets, so that &#8220;la négritude&#8221; is a quite different thing.<br/>

When the U.S. entered WWI, the French had already fought tooth and nail with the Germans and huge numbers of young French men were killed. They had fought valiantly but lost most of the flower of their youth, as they say. My grandpa was in all of the major battles in France and had a military map with a caricature cartoon figure of a Frenchman running away from the enemy on it. That was unfair and they had already fought bravely but had been thrashed. In WWII they were outmaneuvered and relied on an outdated static defense and were overrun by Germans, just like the Poles, Soviets, Czechs, and many other Europeans. In WWII the British were brave but had to retreat and barely got back to Dover with their lives early in the war. They initially got thrashed, too.</p>

<p>The late Assassin&rsquo;s Creed game on the French Revolution* sparked outrage recently among leftists and far-leftists in France over its supposed inaccurately bloodthirty depiction of the French Revolutionaries. And now the Royalists and the Republicans are at each others&rsquo; throats on YouTube and elsewhere over the Reign of Terror and the War in the Vendée.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting they forget their history, but Europeans should put their past differences aside for a while and focus on the much greater threats coming from the other side of the pond if they wish to survive in the centuries to come. Otherwise these quibbles will become moot as there won&rsquo;t be enough indigenous people descended from that era to care about them anyway.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-644680" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The immigration situation here in America is even more schizophrenic in some ways. It is somewhat similar to Obama&rsquo;s Libya and Syria policy, if you can call it that. Obama was allied with Al Qaeda in Libya. The same Al Qaeda and other Muslim extremists (sorry for the redundancy) that Obama supported in Libya killed our emabassy staff as Obama arrested and otherwise prevented admirals and generals from sending aid and watching the killing live via surveillance drone. These terrorists also went to Syria to attack the Assad regime which Obama opposes. Obama supplied them with weapons and low and behold, they gassed civilians and committed other atrocities. Then they took Obamas weapons gifts and formed ISIS/ISIL. Suprise, suprise. Now Obama opposes the enemies of ISIS, the Syrian regime and also Iran. But he opposes ISIS. But maybe the other Islamists will fight them? No. Now they have a truce. To make matters worse, NATO &#8220;ally&#8221; and European Union member Turkey supports ISIS. Obama can&rsquo;t make appropriate alliances because he opposes Iran and Syria but made a pact with the devil to oppose them. Now the fact that Obama supported and armed these &#8220;extremists&#8221; (actully mainstream Muslims following the stated dogma of Islam), prevented rescue of the embassy staff, and empowered ISIS in Syria is off limits and is almost never mentioned in the mainstream press.</p>
<p>The &#8220;anti-racists'&#8221; stance of immigration is just irrational and insane. They are obsessed with blacks and yet they import millions of illegal and legal aliens who displace blacks in the workforce and who hate blacks with a passion (in the case of many, many Mexicans, at least). The supposed supporters of blacks are displacing them and claiming to support them. The blacks seem to barely notice and still support the leftist socialists and communists who patronize them. Meanwhile the Mexicans vote for Obama even though they mainly hate blacks. Now, the people who shall not be named support blacks no matter what, even when they commit pogroms against them (Crown Heights). Those same people militantly demand massive immigration, even of people who will, and do, violently attack them, Muslims. In addition, TV talking heads, University Professors, people who shall not be named, and white &#8220;anti-racist deny what is easily verified as mainstream Islam which is in black and white right in front of anyone with the intellectual integrity to read it, The Koran and The Haditha. To confound the problem, the people who shall not be named and the white &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; put through draconian legislation which essentially creates thought-crimes. That is to say, they put through &#8220;hate crime&#8221; legislation making the wrong thoughts while committing a crime an added crime.</p>

History teaches us that these ethnic hodgepodge countries only &#8220;work&#8221; under the iron fist of totalitarianism. </p>
<p>The underlying themes of the above two posts of this writer are 1) jealousy,hatred and the wish to undermine whites (by all of the groups mentioned above) trumps even other intergroup antagonisms and 2) forcing incompatible groups together is a good way to make it essential to rule with an iron fist and therefore makes it possible to seize such power, which by any measure is not to be desired by any but psychopathic tyrants.</p>

<p>Muslims present the secular left with an existential dilemma. Muslims threaten every value of the secular left. Unfortunately, the secular left sympathizes with them because secular leftists are used to blaming Western civilization for all the evils of the world. </p>
<p>Actually, Western civilization nurtured the secular left. Karl Marx is ensconced in the Western intellectual tradition.</p>

That is true but I might add the important point that both leftist Democrats and politically correct Republicans refuse to admit the evil side of Islam and they insist on the idiotic claim that there are just a few extremists while refusing to see what is right in front of them in the Koran. To make matters worse, education increases the problem. When one takes courses on the middle east, the more palatable aspects of Islam are stressed while the negative aspects (which were written later and therefore supersede the more reasonable teachings, according to their doctrine), all without reading the Koran or the Haditha!</p>

Left meddling with Islam has often meant the Left comming off the worse. The iranian revolution was not a success story for the left.

It amazes me how liberal historians enjoy referring to &#8220;arabs&#8221; as this historically enlightened group who &#8220;saved Western Civilization&#8221; during the Middle Ages and who taught &#8220;dumb Europeans how to count&#8221;. </p>
<p>The truth says otherwise. The parts of the Middle East that were advanced before the European Greeks and Romans came on the scene, were confined to the river valley regions of the Middle East. By the time the Greeks and Romans improved civilizational knowledge ten fold, the only major competitor in the area was the Persians, who were possibly just as white as the Romans.</p>
<p>Then during the &#8220;Dark Ages&#8221;, Europeans were still represented by the Byzantine Greeks who played a powerful role in the Middle East up until the European Renaissance. And still, during this entire time, the main foe in the Middle East was the Persians, when examining intellect. The arabs and turks posed military threats but did very little with math and science.</p>
<p>The Arabian Peninsula, which is where these arabs in France originally came from when looking at genetic history, has given very little to the world. Neither has North Africa for that matter. &#8220;The uniqueness of Western Civilization&#8221; has just been delivered to my door and I can&rsquo;t wait to open it. It debunks modern day multicultural revisionist history, and actually pays the current lies about China&rsquo;s achievements, a great deal of visitation.</p>

<p>Jews place Jewish interests in first place and anybody else&rsquo;s interests a very distant second. It is not a technically difficult point to intellectually comprehend, but internalizing it seems beyond most people&rsquo;s ability. </p>

<p>I believe in reason, science and DNA. If Mr. Zemmour&rsquo;s family has full Spanish or Italian ancestry, then he is (Southern) European. If Carthagian&rsquo;s ancestry, i.e. Phoenician, he is a Levantine white. If not then he is mixed or North African.<br/>
European Jews are Europeans. But if they don&rsquo;t think they are white or think being Jewish is above being white, then hop they go to Israel like other non-whites will have to go to their countries. Moreover those anti-white, liberal leftists Jews destroying white countries, those are traitors, like other anti-whites they will be held responsible.</p>

The EU must be regarded as yet another anti-White force.

Perhaps western Ukrainians see the EU as some sort of &#8216;guarantor&rsquo; against Russian domination, but they are making a Faustian bargain. Inevitably, the EU will impose non-White immigration upon Ukraine, and it will end up as a non White majority state just like all the rest.</p>

In that conference, the Anglican Church went against Christian teaching and approved of artificial birth control. Then slowly other Christian denominations caved in. In the 60s there was pressure for the Catholic Church to accept contraception, but Pope Paul VI did not approve and wrote about the dangers of using birth control in &#8216;Humane Vitate&rsquo; in 1968 and how it would lead to destruction of the family, increase in homosexuality, rapes, and treating women like sex objects. Sadly most Catholics do not follow that teaching and contracept. These Catholics that contracept are white, but the non white Catholics like the spics they have kids by the boatload.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-645979" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>French colonization of north Africa only lasted from 1830 to around 1960. Their colonization of sub Saharan Africa was even briefer, from around 1890 to 1965. In the scheme of things, these stretches of time amount to nothing, in fact roughly half that time period has passed since post colonial times. As an aside, France only colonized north Africa as some sort of consolation for Napoleon&rsquo;s European ambitions being thwarted, and for England effectively ejecting France from north America.<br/>
France sent actual colonists to Algeria, with the intention of making this &#8216;new land&rsquo; an integral part of France. However, the Arab nationalist movement gained traction, stood firm and reconquered their native land from the French. The Arabs lost absolutely no time whatsoever in ejecting French colonists and making Algeria Algerian all over again.</p>
<p>The irony is amazing. The former colonized, in Algeria and elsewhere, have not only succeeding in turning the tables and starting to colonize their colonizers, but in all probability it is very very likely that they will fully succeed and render their prize, France, as an adjunct to the African, Muslim world.</p>
<p>I must say that history really has no parallel to such an appalling and stunning volte face being executed so speedily and decisively. Remember, we are talking about France, an ancient nation, which can justifiably be described as the world&rsquo;s premier nation, a nation that has been a major power for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>The moral is that nothing but nothing can withstand bad politicians.</p>

Much of their DNA traces back to the Near East and Northern Turkey (not the middle east) generally speaking, but they are not a monolithic group. Different Jews have very different histories and lineages. They show some regional/local admixture from every area they&rsquo;ve settled and also show some degree of mixing from founding lineages of Jews who settled in particular regions and married locals. Some 20 percent of Eastern European Jews for example are R1a, an almost specifically Slavic haplotype.</p>
