				Water-Cooler White Nationalism

				John Ingram, American Renaissance, July 25, 2014

				Getting out the message &mdash; safely.
			</p>
		<p>
			For decades, race realists, paleoconservatives, white nationalists, or white advocates &mdash; my preferred term &mdash; have known the score. Races are inherently different. These differences make any multiracial society an ungovernable mess. We&rsquo;d all be better off living separately, or at least acknowledging racial differences and allowing for them in public policy. Open immigration, affirmative action, color-blindness, forced diversity, heavy government spending-all these policies are bound to fail, because equality can&rsquo;t be legislated.
		</p>
		<p>
			And, finally: Whites are a bona fide <em>group</em> with the right to associate among themselves in all aspects of life (including governance), to exclude others, and to determine their own destiny.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, even to broach these topics will get most of us fired from our jobs. Our topic is too hot to handle. I have followed these issues for more than a decade, but never during that period have I held a job that would allow me to speak openly about race. Whether as a government attorney or a law firm associate, I was always a phone call from some busybody &ldquo;watchdog&rdquo; group that could have me fired and leave me unable to support a family. My wife lives in fear of such a call.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is infuriating. I can subscribe to forbidden journals and read forbidden websites. I can comment anonymously. I can even get on a plane and meet like-minded people at conferences. But I cannot publicly speak or write about the issue I&rsquo;ve decided is most central: the displacement and dispossession of whites. I certainly can&rsquo;t talk about it at work.
		</p>
		<p>
			We read accounts of white person after white person-none of whom is even a white advocate-who makes an off-hand remark, tweet, or Facebook post and is fired. Free speech in America is costly. So many whites have been fired for politically incorrect associations or expressions that they could probably form their own company somewhere.
		</p>
		<p>
			For better or for worse, most of the time it is perfectly legal to fire someone for his political views. The First Amendment prohibits government from punishing white advocacy, but private employers-and probably most public employers-are under no such restrictions. This <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2002/07/can_your_boss_fire_you_for_your_political_beliefs.html"><em>Slate</em> article</a> notes that it&rsquo;s harder to fire government employees for political beliefs, but imagine a New York City police captain writing under his own name for American Renaissance and keeping his job. There&rsquo;s some case law that would support him, but it would be very tricky litigation.
		</p>
		<p>
			A <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/dhs-still-hasn-t-fired-black-supremacist-who-called-for-mass-murder-of-whites-20131119">black nationalist</a> who called for mass murder of whites hung on to his job at Homeland Security for weeks, but even he was <a href="http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20131212-dhs-fires-black-supremacist-employee">eventually fired</a>. I don&rsquo;t doubt that a &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; would have been booted much more quickly.
		</p>
		<p>
			In many states, employment is &#8220;at will,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;at the will of the employer,&#8221; who can fire you for any reason or no reason-except because of your race, sex, national origin, etc. Perhaps a creative lawyer could argue that firing a white person for white advocacy is tantamount to firing him because of his race and is thus illegal. Far more elaborate notions have worked to the benefit of non-whites. Certainly, it would help for more lawyers to represent white advocates aggressively and creatively, but the court system is not our friend.
		</p>
		<p>
			Often, whites get in trouble on the job simply for reacting normally. I recently read about a woman <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/07/employee_fired_after_telling_c.html">who was fired</a> for complaining about Spanish-speaking co-workers. I don&rsquo;t know if she was white, but countless whites are driven nuts by constant Spanish chatter. In today&rsquo;s politically correct world, it&rsquo;s not the rude Hispanics but the aggrieved whites who are the bad guys. Instead of complaining to the Spanish-speakers directly, who probably turned around and complained about their &#8220;racist&#8221; co-worker, she could have filed her own complaint.
		</p>
		<p>
			In situations like this, whites need to keep their cool, document everything, and go through official channels. They need to get wise to how steeply the deck is stacked against them, and move cautiously.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is possible to arrange one&rsquo;s life in order to be free to speak, but this is hard. Even self-employed people have run into campaigns to drive off their customers or clients. Blue-collar jobs such as truck driving give more protection, since people in those milieus don&rsquo;t like being pushed around. When have you heard of a plumber being fired for his politics?
		</p>
		<p>
			And this is what got me thinking about &#8220;water-cooler white nationalism:&#8221; a form of white advocacy that could pass as chit-chat around the water cooler at the office (or the faculty lounge, factory break room, etc.) even if non-white co-workers are present.
		</p>
		<p>
			With this in mind, we need something that goes beyond the boundaries of our workaday lives but not so far as the grand phrases of Internet-and-AR-conferences white advocacy. We need terminology, mindsets, and concepts that won&rsquo;t get us fired and can be discussed around the water cooler or with relatives at Thanksgiving.
		</p>
		<p>
			Racial differences probably could not be part of that discussion-talking about race and IQ makes people think of gas chambers. However, it may be possible to bring up the impending minority status for whites, fair treatment for all races, and the right of free association.
		</p>
		<p>
			&#8220;Water-cooler white advocacy&#8221; could start with a reference to something in the news, such as the comments like those of a Canadian professor <a href="/">who complained</a> about the manipulation of white guilt. This could lead to saying that you aren&rsquo;t ashamed to be white, that whites have rights, and that maybe not everyone always has to be together. In other words, common sense.
		</p>
		<p>
			Preferably, the word &#8220;white&#8221; should be part of the conversation. Affirmative action is unfair <em>because it hurts whites</em>. You want your children to marry <em>whites</em>, you like living in a <em>white</em> neighborhood, and you&rsquo;re dismayed by the low <em>white</em> birthrate.
		</p>
		<p>
			If that&rsquo;s too strong, &ldquo;white&rdquo; can simply be implied. I used to live in an area with lots of Asians. One of my co-workers got a transfer to the West Coast and was trying to sell his house. It was a nice house in a nice suburb, but it had a terrible flaw-at least to Chinese. It was on a T-intersection, with a street that led to the front door. Chinese-even the fancy Chinese who live in the United States-believe in <em>feng shui</em>, which is mumbo jumbo about the orientation of houses and placement of furniture. According to <em>feng shui</em>, if a street leads to the front door, all the energy will drain out of the house. No Chinese would buy the house, and whites wouldn&rsquo;t buy it either, for fear that when it came time to sell, it would still be under the <em>feng shui </em>curse.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I heard this story, I said, &ldquo;Immigrants bring their crazy ideas over here, and now you can&rsquo;t even sell your house.&rdquo; Everyone in the room agreed. It started a useful conversation about what immigration is doing to America.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are ways to talk about key issues that emphasize the positive rather than the negative. Rather than talk about why we don&rsquo;t want to live in black or Hispanic neighborhoods-crime, poor work ethic, anti-white attitudes-we should focus on the solution: the right to live with the people of your choice. This approach draws more sympathy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead of criticizing illegal aliens, ask why we should have to pay taxes for the services they consume. Point out that immigrants come to take advantage of what we have created, and that it is wrong to exploit white guilt.
		</p>
		<p>
			We even have our own victim cards to play, and in certain circumstances we should play them: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like affirmative action because it hurts whites. Why shouldn&rsquo;t my son get to attend the University of Texas?&#8221; &ldquo;People always talk about how great diversity is, but they always mean people who aren&rsquo;t white. Is there something wrong with white people because they aren&rsquo;t diverse?&rdquo;
		</p>
		<p>
			Water-cooler white advocacy is not going to change the world. However, it is a good way to find out if you have comrades in the workplace. There are more racially conscious people around you than you may realize. They may be afraid to take the first step, but will follow if you give them an opening. Once you have made contact with other white advocates, you can pursue common interests outside of the office. If you can find others who are just beginning to understand race, you can help them along.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the same time, for anyone who works in an office or group it is good to have a network of fellow dissidents. Alliances are a useful part of office politics, and if you can trust someone with your thoughts on race, you can probably trust him with other things.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, talking about the terrible problems our country faces is one way to do something about them. Every new person whose eyes you can open is a new ally, a new comrade. If you can&rsquo;t risk your job by speaking publicly, &ldquo;water-cooler white advocacy&rdquo; can be your way to add to our ranks-and accomplish something.

									This is good for reaching white people who are in the middle or unwashed or uncommitted. But I happen to think that far many more people agree with us than we think. It&rsquo;s just that the reason why that has not translated into more social and political success is that people who think like us don&rsquo;t perceive a credible vehicle to translate their racial frustrations into positive effective social or political action and results.

										They&rsquo;re also afraid of being &#8216;seen&rsquo; as agreeing with you. Every day there is an article about a white person, and only a white person, saying or doing something &#8216;insensitive&rsquo; and the key message brought to you, being punished for it. I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;re at the point where they would &#8216;turn you in&rsquo; even though they agree with you. Maybe they would playfully twist the knife or needle you about it, move you closer to the coals but not try and Really harm you.

										I had an Asian guy as part of my work team for many years and I found that he and I could openly discuss race and racial issues almost as easily as I could with a fellow White Nationalist. This guy was many years older than i was, and had spent 20 years of his life in the US Navy - but, he most certainly had no problem discussing race realism. He most certainly knew the score regarding blacks and would even express his disgust whenever he would see an example of a White female going with black males. His attitude was basically: &#8216;Why would a White woman want to disgrace her father and destroy the genes that he and his wife had passed down to her?&rsquo;
									</p>
									<p>
										At the same time, however, this guy would tell me about how he wanted to import as many of his relatives from the motherland as he could. So, he wasn&rsquo;t necessarily pro-White. He was a race realist who was pro-Asian, but could see the point of view of native White Americans.

													Thanks, dear. I understand and share the desire for there to always be White and Oriental homelands where the stock remains more or less pure, but&hellip;
												</p>
												<p>
													Two bright and attractive industrious folk interact, things happen. Central Asia, now North America, especially the west coast, look like logical places for this.
												</p>
												<p>
													Welcome, despite your Irishness, you are quite welcome here. Love my Celtic cousins the micks, of course. Scrappy and kind of half crazy - something we could use some of&hellip;
												</p>
												<p>
													It was funny with the half Asians. At first they looked at me like I was crazy, then after I quoted some &#8220;Engelman stats&#8221; (IQ averages, etc) and let it be known I&rsquo;m not a Nazi (though the Nazis seemed to have a high opinion of both Japanese and Chinese)&hellip;
												</p>
												<p>
													They looked at me differently. When the great darkie knock-out horde comes, these guys will be my shieldmates, and welcome into the community.
												</p>
												<p>
													The Allemani - the &#8220;All Men&#8221; - a late antiquity Germanic Folk, took in escaped Roman slaves and handed out weapons. If they fought and stood by the Allmen, they were Allmen. I&rsquo;m sure they took in a Hun or two, lol&hellip;
												</p>
												<p>
													One more thing. I cannot speak for all the folk here, but there IS an alternative to &#8220;Castle Wolfenstein&#8221; style nationalism. This is it, and we are heartily disliked by some other strains of White Nationalism/Identitarianism/whateva-ism&hellip;
												</p>
												<p>
													The new American White will contain strands of non-or-questionably/arguably White DNA like humans carry traces of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA.

													Same here. Not on the mixed-race part (although I do have some North African ancestry), but of me being liberal on most issues, except on race and immigration.
												</p>
												<p>
													By the way, we do have a couple of mixed-race regulars on this site. One of them even makes the Top Commenters list. There&rsquo;s also a Korean guy and a - believe it or not - black guy that comment here from time to time.
												</p>
												<p>
													Those who are purist and frequently use the word &#8220;mongrel&#8221; tend to be supremacist, not just nationalist. I think at least half of the people here don&rsquo;t mind other races (especially Asian) being in the country as long as they remain a small minority and aren&rsquo;t overrepresented in crime and such things.
												</p>
												<p>
													I&rsquo;m normally opposed to race-mixing, because it would be genocidal if practiced on a large scale. However, I don&rsquo;t mind it if it&rsquo;s practiced on a small scale (like 2%), because the mixed-race will eventually be able to get back in line, and at some point, their descendants will be nothing like their non-white ancestor. Many Americans have some drop of Amerindian blood, but are today perfectly white. Therefore I don&rsquo;t mind people who are of mixed ancestry, especially if they&rsquo;re on our side, because, well, what&rsquo;s done is done. And also because it&rsquo;s reversible after a few generations; as long as this remains a marginal practice, the racial aliens and mixed-race can be successfully absorbed back into the dominant race. Just like the Homo Sapiens absorbed the Neanderthals.

													Yeah, I mean, if there&rsquo;s gonna be &#8220;pollutin&#8221; then a little East Asiatic is about the best &#8220;pollutin&#8221; I can Imagine. When east-Asian gets to a quarter it&rsquo;s already almost unrecognizable in most.<br />

													If any still doubt that&rsquo;s their bees wax, but let&rsquo;s take a look at the numbers and let&rsquo;s also take a look at the genetics of &#8220;White&#8221;, especially in the N. American context.<br />
													Tiny bit of N. African, eh? Seen &#8220;Intimate Enemies&#8221; on Netflix? I See why the Frenchies wanted to hold onto that real estate. Gorgeous and dramatic. Hey, maybe you have some retrogressed Vandal in there, lol. My drip drop of Sephardic Jew puts a tiny part of me kind of in the same neighborhood.<br />
													I&rsquo;m big on pragmatism and can tolerate almost anything depending on the individual, though the goal is White in the big pic. Different races and types, however, blend in better than others&hellip;

													<em>&#8220;When east-Asian gets to a quarter it&rsquo;s already almost unrecognizable in most.&#8221;</em>
												</p>
												<p>
													Not just East Asian. My grandmother was half-North African, and even <strong>her</strong> non-white ancestry was barely noticeable. At least, in the few pictures I saw.
												</p>
												<p>
													Sub-Saharan African is the toughest ancestry to fade across generations. That&rsquo;s why even in the One-Drop era, the one drop for black was one-sixteenth, while the one drops for the other races were either one-eighth or one-fourth.
												</p>
												<p>
													White Americans have always mixed races to an extent, but they&rsquo;re still perfectly white to this day (I mean, no one considers Brad Pitt to be mixed), because whites have always way outnumbered non-whites, which is why the latter were successfully absorbed. And it didn&rsquo;t affect their ability to build well-functioning white societies just like the other European societies they hailed from. It&rsquo;s all about ratios.
												</p>
												<p>
													However, today the race-mixing has increased to an alarming rate (11% for whites), and we aren&rsquo;t outnumbering non-whites enough anymore to successfully absorb the mixed-race. I&rsquo;m afraid if that trend is sustained, the race-mixing might leave indelible marks on white America.
												</p>
												<p>
													<em>&#8220;Tiny bit of N. African, eh? Seen &#8220;Intimate Enemies&#8221; on Netflix? I See why the Frenchies wanted to hold onto that real estate. Gorgeous and dramatic.&#8221;</em>
												</p>
												<p>
													I haven&rsquo;t seen that movie, but seems interesting. I&rsquo;ll put it on my to-watch list.
												</p>
												<p>
													The French clung to Algeria (which where my great-grandparent hails, I think) more than any other colony of theirs, yes. In addition to its geographic location, it was also because they physically settled there for more than a century, and it was considered as part of France after a moment.
												</p>
												<p>
													They clung even more to it after they discovered oil in the 1950&rsquo;s.
												</p>
												<p>
													But then the Revolution started. And even though the French were able to quash it militarily, there was international (the U.N., the U.S., the non-aligned movement), and even domestic (French commies and marxists) pressure to give the Algerians self-determination.
												</p>
												<p>
													Finally, I think the problem of demographics was what tipped the scale for De Gaulle. Once it had access to French medical care, the indigenous Algerian population went from 2 to 10 million, thus outnumbering the French there by a lot. If Algeria remained part of France, then who could keep this (racially and culturally) different population from moving to the mainland? So they were granted self-determination in 1962.
												</p>
												<p>
													<em>&#8220;Hey, maybe you have some retrogressed Vandal in there, lol.&#8221;</em>
												</p>
												<p>
													Possible. A tiny part of the Algerian population does have some Vandal contributions. The Vandals had their kingdom in modern-day Tunisia, but they also settled in modern-day Algeria, especially near the isolated mountainous regions (Djurdjura and Aures). They finally had it out with Romans some time in the 5th century, and got their a__es kicked. So a part of Vandals just fled in the mountains up north, and hid with the local Berbers (the Kabyle group especially) and they just stayed there and integrated with them. That Berber group to this day has higher concentrations of blondes and redheads. Same with other Berber groups, especially the Chaouis, and the Riffians in Morocco.
												</p>
												<p>
													<em>&#8220;My drip drop of Sephardic Jew puts a tiny part of me kind of in the same neighborhood.&#8221;</em>
												</p>
												<p>
													I guess it does.
												</p>
												<p>
													Most Sephardic Jews fled Algeria right after the independence, along with the other French. The few that remained fled when the Civil War broke out in the 90&rsquo;s. Some to France, others to Israel.
												</p>
												<p>
													<em>&#8220;I think Japan is destined to re-establish a new, Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but one its Asiatic allies will want to contain China. Sort of how Germany now de-facto rules Western/Central Europe&hellip;&#8221;</em>
												</p>
												<p>
													I&rsquo;m not against that principle, actually. I always think that the most competent should be the most entitled to rule the roost. Especially if the roost is racially homogenous.
												</p>
												<p>
													The only reason I&rsquo;m against the E.U. is that it&rsquo;s by and large pro-immigration. It&rsquo;s taking the easy way out for its need for labor, which is importing people instead of giving birth incentives to the natives.

													Pure Europeans require less than a quarter of non-white ancestries for it to be considered irrelevant. A quarter is still in the genes, in the ancestry, and will probably still affect the skin or face or head or brain or nature in some way or other.
												</p>
												<p>
													Whites with a quarter non-white ancestries don&rsquo;t look pure European, but ambiguously mixed. This is precisely the stage where you can tell how horrible it is to have non-white admixture! Because you look nearly white, but not quite. Something is always off! White people will slight and ugly Mongol and Negro admixture are ruined whites! This is catastrophic! The beauty of Europeans do NOT rise from admixture –either slight or strong. NONE AT ALL!!!

													I mean, looking at how it seems to work, like practically an average of the mix in terms of average IQ, that mix should yield a 97.5 average IQ, almost White standard.

													I think Japan is destined to re-establish a new, Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but one its Asiatic allies will want to contain China. Sort of how Germany now de-facto rules Western/Central Europe&hellip;<br />
													&gt;&gt;<br />
													Germany rules a coming-soon caliphate of Islam whose majority culture will, as a function of birth rates and regional IQ, destroy all that has quality in Europe. The Arab peninsula had 80 million people in it in 1953 when De Gaulle initiated &#8216;anti Americanism&rsquo; as rejection of Marshall Plan dominance, through the EADS dialogues. In 2003, they had 320 million. Their average IQ is around 84.<br />
													Allowing the entry of a warrior cult whose R-Breeder birth rates _precede_ Mohammed is begging for displacement as, every sixty years sees three North African or South West Asian generations of 4-5 children for every two of whites with 4 children, max.<br />
													Merging with them for cheap oil and the chance to sell goods for capitalist gain is inviting social degradation on a massive scale as those 15 children will either be welfare dependents for life or be given employment commensurate with their own achievement levels as 7-11 clerks and Restauranteurs.<br />
													Whites will _watch this happen_ within their lifetimes, as there are simply no jobs created for high tech capable minds and those who displace their own children will not miss such skills because they are used to living in squalor and have no comprehension of what created the wondrous fairytale landscape they enjoy and exploit.<br />
													In this, the Germans have gone from conquest to improve our racial position to trading moral and evolutionary correctness for absolute commercial power. And this, coupled with the negation of any right to talk against it, means that they are now a part of the problem rather than it&rsquo;s solution.<br />
													This makes Germans a lesser people than they once were for power in and of it&rsquo;s own sake is nothing if it doesn&rsquo;t seek to stand for quality. WE are evolution&rsquo;s choice. It simply selects, randomly, for &#8216;good enough&rsquo;. But WE can be the ones who determinatively choose, not simply to be survivors but to succeed beyond all measure.<br />
													Put our women back in the home as breeders until we can develop exogenics. Develop genomic therapies from fully mapped comprehension of the SNP chains which trigger developed intelligence.<br />
													And _stay white_. Because R-Breeding is now a social as well as genetic artifact of the lesser peoples of this earth and one whose locust swarming we can only roll back by having safe homelands at our backs which are genetically, and culturally OURS.<br />
													Not something that other racial groups can claim as their own, simply because they live where whites do what we do for our own people.

													I used to be completely liberal, even in regards to race and immigration, but that was due to youth, schooling, and the culture I am surrounded by (West Coast). But reality has been a BIG slap to the face for me, and despite my initial liberalness in those matters, I find myself less and less fearful of being called out as a racist, which in certain circles some liberals seem to fear more than death!

													I&rsquo;m curious about this too. My guess is she doesn&rsquo;t look very asian and therefore lacks a lot of the non-white privilege to talk about race.

													You are correct. I do look more White than Asian. It is the hair and the very slight almond shape to my eyes that gives me away. Sick of it: I have not been called a racist to my face yet, but where I&rsquo;m located, pretty much anything that casts a shadow is subject to being called a racist if any viewpoints differ from the pro-illegal immigrant, pro-welfare state stance.

													The trick to countering the &#8220;Waaaycisss&#8221; accusation around the terminally libtarded is to (first) not be affected by it (esp visibly). Then turn it around on them by making them, essentially, defend their empty little insult. When the libtards start calling names or get upset, they are out of argument (what little they had anyways). You can easily use this to your advantage.<br />
													.<br />
													I&rsquo;ve been in several debates with libtards, both subtle and heated. Once they drop the &#8220;R&#8221; word on me, its basically over. That&rsquo;s them telling me they&rsquo;re out of ammo. Remain calm, make your points, wait for them to leave. Sometimes it sinks in.

													On the other hand, what &#8216;sinks in&rsquo; as they ponder their moral supremacy vs. your simply being right is a tremendous resentment that their predatory empathy _still_ hasn&rsquo;t solved anything and they still cannot defeat the cold logic of &#8220;If you let invaders in and then they breed you out of living space without being able to secure their own existence, as yours because they are dumb, aggressive and uninterested in group conformism to what made white society work, it&rsquo;s all your fault.&#8221;

													Libtards hissy fits is the extroversion of their inferiority complex at being &#8216;nice guy&rsquo; types in a world which is still run according to unforgiving rules where incompetence means you are used.
												</p>
												<p>
													The entire &#8216;no race but the human race&rsquo; social revolution is the meek&rsquo;s declaration of war upon the intelligent by which they WILL HAVE dominance, even if the earth that they inherit is a festering cess pit compared to the one which would have eventuated if the wars between races had been allowed to play out to it&rsquo;s logical whites and dumb exogroups endgame.
												</p>
												<p>
													That combination of personal introversion as denial of their own weakness _still being weak_ in alliance with other non-competents whose agendas they don&rsquo;t share (because they are poor, dumb and ugly with little social gain potential).
												</p>

												<p>
													Will ensure that whatever sinks in, it will be the fury of the utter failure, lashing out to deny the inevitable (wrong from the beginning) that punishes us for their stupidity.

													It is because of this that there is only ONE HOPE for the residual greatness that was once white to survive: Retreat.

													You are just making targets of yourselves, not least because anything you say or do that they admire will come with a requirement that you join their group-social dynamic before it will be accepted in.

													The danger in low level race mixing lies in elimination of the tiny slice of the white population that has a natural ability for technology and science.

													Well, it&rsquo;s all about proportions and ratios. Modern-day southern European countries (just like the rest of Europe at the time) had a population of a few millions each in the Middle Ages. The Muslim invaders (North Africans, Arabs, Turks) were counted by hundreds of thousands. The ratio was dangerously high if any race-mixing were to occur.
												</p>
												<p>
													Don&rsquo;t forget that the northern populations of Norway, Sweden, and Finland also have some admixtures of Sami and Lapps blood. But the race-mixing remained limited. Compare those to the Irish for example, who may be the only Europeans who never had to deal or mix with any non-European population, and yet they&rsquo;re way behind the French, English, and Scandinavians in social and economic advancement.
												</p>
												<p>
													So I still believe that limited race-mixing isn&rsquo;t that nefarious, as long as the percentage of the miscegenators remains very low proportionally to the entire population. When it gets higher, it may leave indelible scars, which what I think happened in the Iberian peninsula, Greece, southern Italy, and a few other southeastern European populations, who had to deal with <strong>centuries</strong> of non-European occupation.
												</p>
												<p>
													The race-mixing rate for whites in the U.S. is alarmingly high though (11%). I&rsquo;m afraid that if that trend is sustained for many other decades, it might leave its indelible scars too. Even though I&rsquo;m sure a large part of it is Asian, therefore it won&rsquo;t affect intelligence that much, but still.

													Race mixing with Asians does have the advantage of not producing intellectually inferior offspring, as is the case when Whites mix with AmerIndians and especially Negroes. This does not, however, mean that race mixing with Asians is okay. The Asiatic peoples have different personality traits from Whites, and produce societies very different from White European societies.

													It goes beyond loss of intelligence to shifting of potential.<br />
													The low end whites who cast their lot with whomever &#8216;simple minds distracted by simple things&rsquo; will give them pleasure or non-shame about their bottom of the layer cake existence, will gift the resulting (Hispanic or mulatto) hybrids with a .5 MSD displacement upwards which makes them able to further the infiltration of our culture with it&rsquo;s inevitable &#8216;fellow countrymen must be treated as fellow kin&rsquo; sociopathic results.<br />
													Now consider that the smart whites live as though their own lives were all that encompassed the total of our species potential (for that is what race really is, a pre-speciation event separate gene pool) and seldom have children or if they do, don&rsquo;t have them with &#8216;maternal types&rsquo;, happy to trade security for authority within the household of large families.<br />
													Instead breeding with other hyper intelligent, equally distracted, types whose competitive nature leaves them dissatisfied and feeling burdened.<br />
													Their children then growing up latch keyed by ambition as divorce with typically no hope for a future at their parent&rsquo;s level of income achievement, even if they care to repeat the cold, lonely, isolated existence.<br />
													This is the full truth of a world where female liberation has destroyed our generational base as the confidence to tackle the world from a loving family home filled with niche` competing siblings as the challenge as much as security to go forth and _be white_.<br />
													While the radical undertow from non-whites swamps us with a predatory empathy that ends with pregnancy and hybrid populations whose average IQ is _downwardly mobile_ &#8216;somewhere between the white and Hispanic or black norms&rsquo;.<br />
													Say No To Mixing.<br />
													If you want to get white women off the work force and into the sustaining our gene pool battle, you need to create social environments where white men can build wealth through exclusive access to white&rsquo;s only labor positions, throughout the strata of our society.<br />
													Just as you need to turn the tools of science away from war and entertainment, back to their intended use as _improving us_.<br />
													Failure to see and act on these conditions will see society fragmented and destroyed by those groups whose short generational interval and highly profligate total offspring numbers generate &#8216;the work force of tomorrow&rsquo; with the IQs of societies from 10,000 years ago.

													Those who are purist and frequently use the word &#8220;mongrel&#8221; tend to be supremacist, not just nationalist.<br />
													&gt;&gt;
												</p>
												<p>
													In a world where beauty and fierceness are not their own excuses to predominate In a cultural setting, reminders of where the potential came from are an important &#8216;rep&rsquo; (resentation as reputational entry) to any condition where other racial supremacists seek to lessen our position to raise up their own.<br />
													It is not our fault that ours is the culture that the globe _chooses) to emulate. It is our responsibility to maintain the separation which created that genius and continues it within the pure bloodlines. It is a horrific tragedy to generate accomodationists out of those whose lack of intelligence as self esteem lets them be swooned into losing what _their children_ might someday find brilliance in, provided that half their own DNA is not lost to the ordinariness of other races.<br />
													&#8220;Great things. Terrible, yes. But Great.&#8221;<br />
													Has a genetic base underpinning.<br />
													Did every other race on this earth disappear tomorrow, whites would abide and thrive. Did whites leave this world tomorrow, even the East Asians would be hard pressed to live.<br />
													That we can and do form balances within our own communities that are homeostatic is the true mark of our &#8216;supremacy&rsquo; over others because the real danger is not IQ driven but population numbers equivalent and the other nations of this earth have been R-Breeders to our K-Breeding for so long that it is had evolutionary side effects.
												</p>
												<p>
													&gt;&gt;<br />
													Therefore I don&rsquo;t mind people who are of mixed ancestry, especially if they&rsquo;re on our side, because, well, what&rsquo;s done is done.<br />
													&gt;&gt;<br />
													No. Because you must find a place for them. And if you will not abide breeding with them and the majority of your fellow whites, blacks, Hispanics or Asians will not either, what happens is that the hybrid breeds to hybrid until vigor becomes slump.<br />
													And since this is a world ruled by information dominance as the direct artifact of intelligence and given that it is also a common genetic rule of thumb that your children will have intelligence somewhere between the average of your combined IQ and your population mean, you have instantly created a situation where &#8216;accepting the reality&rsquo; of consequence to someone else&rsquo; bad choices means either generating a sub class who are less able to compete (white to black becomes mulatto to Eurasian or mestizo to mulatto on a sharply downwards hybrid slump basis).<br />
													Or importing more of another, lesser, population who look up at the hybrid as still being better than their own social position allows for as a function of material or genetic wealth.<br />
													DO NOT THINK that this doesn&rsquo;t happen. Anyone who has traveled through central America has seen the Casta System in action as the artifact of a color continuum where only the top flight Mestizos can hold onto their position by continually importing white genes in a blonde container.<br />
													&gt;&gt;<br />
													And also because it&rsquo;s reversible after a few generations; as long as this remains a marginal practice, the racial aliens and mixed-race can be successfully absorbed back into the dominant race. Just like the Homo Sapiens absorbed the Neanderthals.<br />
													&gt;&gt;<br />
													You make multiple assumptions here you are not qualified to do as indeed, the fate of the Neanderthals is one which even the best scientists know will likely never be answered as it is lost to the depths of time.<br />
													While the nature of racial blendout is not one of conserving genes but spreading them to annihilation. This happened when the Aryan peoples &#8216;got lost&rsquo; on one of their river trips and ended up in Northern India. Northern India is a land of 84 IQ morons where one in a million is born with blonde hair (and olive not white skin and _intermediate_ IQ).<br />
													What is certain is that our immediate ancestors, sometime between 6-10,000 years ago, suffered a mutation which altered the way our bodies dealt with certain fats and in particular the manner by which our females laid down those fats on their thighs to feed their growing fetuses high proteinated acids which accelerate brain growth and lead to huge leveraging of conceptual intellect without losing the rational, logical, reasoning capabilities that many other races have in some measure.<br />
													The result has been an evolutionary gateway which, if we protect it, will allow us to separate completely from the existing homo sapiens sapiens speciated group.<br />
													And it is an underlying, instinctive, awareness of what this means that causes the rest of the planet, having already seen what we have done, historically, to Primal Fear their own replacement as anachronistic remnants whose evolutionary maximum will be snubbed by our overriding demands for the resources and space for our people.<br />
													This is the reality of evolutionary competition. You grow up in Terrain Isolates, developing internal genetic modulations of a common (since last expansion) genome and then you spread.<br />
													And those groups who get in your way get dead or beat you back or annihilatively absorb you, dependent on their own genetic strengths.<br />
													We are perverting this process by allowing failure to infiltrate and annihilate the genetic as social resource potential for success to take the next evolutionary step.<br />
													It is bad enough to be forced to assume a neutral posture of homoestasis (as the tree which doesn&rsquo;t grow, dies) within out own environment. But to be forced to a submissive posture as -everyone else- fulfills the expand-to-succeed genetic recombinancy instinct of failed Genetic Algorithms is truly evil.<br />
													As is anyone who endorses this or makes a backhanded accommodation of it.

													As I said in my earlier comment, I&rsquo;m against miscegenation in general. But if you see <strong>any</strong> drop of non-European blood as poisonous, then you&rsquo;re assuming that<br />
													<strong>every</strong> non-white is mentally inferior than<br />
													<strong>every</strong> white person. And anyone who&rsquo;s dealt with racial aliens in his/her life knows that to be untrue.
												</p>
												<p>
													That&rsquo;s the reason that kind of supremacism is getting unpopular among white nationalists, and I&rsquo;m glad it is. Wanting your folks to have a homeland and have dominance over it is one thing; seeing every non-white as an inferior polluter to every white is just irrational bigotry.
												</p>
												<p>
													I see you&rsquo;re hoping for speciation. Well, I wish it had occured earlier too. That way, we wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about miscegenation. Although that&rsquo;s not entirely certain, since the different <em>Homo</em> species could still interbreed.
												</p>
												<p>
													As for Neanderthals, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how they went extinct. The fact is that most of us have some of their DNA, as well as Denisovans&rsquo;. And even though we had better mental capacities than them, we still managed to remain overall superior than other races who hadn&rsquo;t been as &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; by Neanderthals as us.
												</p>
												<p>
													You also seem to imply that the European race is typically a K-breeding one. And that&rsquo;s not true. Numbers have always surpassed quality among Europeans up until the invention of condoms and contraceptive pills. And even if it is today, then it&rsquo;s not the only race, since the fertility rates of Northeast Asians are even lowers than ours*.

													You love whom you love and all that, fine. Your choice, your mistake, nobody has a right to gainsay you, this generation.
												</p>
												<p>
													But when your progeny have no one among whites whom they want to interbreed with, do you then say: &#8220;Oh alright, let&rsquo;s bring in just a few more so that nobody has to go lonely&hellip;&#8221;??
												</p>
												<p>
													Then I say no because you are indeed poisoning our gene base by destroying options of future white generations to benefit by _being white_. Not brown. Not yellow. Not inbetween. But phenotype recognizeably of an advanced gene pool, unequalled by other races and envied to the point that the number one global cosmetic industry is that of making dark skin look brighter.

													Chinese is 93% ethnic Hahn. They have quite a few racial subtypes among them but they are so demanding in their conformism to the cultural norm that they manage to get along.
												</p>
												<p>
													And yet&hellip; With a shortage measured in the tens of millions thanks to the general Chinese denigration of the role of women as breeders during the &#8216;one child policy&rsquo; era (which is still, officially, in place for most of China, only those successful partners with &#8216;urban residence certificates&rsquo; generally having access to superior multi-child families), what has happened is an _artificial_ down turn of some tiny fraction of the 1.37 billion population. Since China still does value sons and still are culturally homogenous, they don&rsquo;t face imminent (we will not see 2200 at present rates of miscegenation and population implosion), self-induced, blendout.
												</p>
												<p>
													We do.
												</p>
												<p>
													And if we let in competing groups and do not breed with them as a function of aesthetic or economic or cultural distaste we will find that they out breed us, 3:1 @ 3-5 kids per woman. in a sixty year arc.
												</p>
												<p>
													Whites cannot survive multiculturalism. Our power as a culture comes from our being a low birth rate, long personal development race. Combine those factors of non cultural homogenity and low birth rate with a preference not to share but live apart and you will see that not only will what we give away through miscegenation be forever lost but their chunk of the socio-economic pie will increase until we can no longer support our children&rsquo;s welfare, _no matter how few of them we have_.
												</p>
												<p>
													This is unacceptable and it cannot be changed because the baseline IQs of the other races which underline the qualtiy of our society, as a group average, are so much lower than our own. Mexican&rsquo;s cannot melt into an American pot as Poles, Germans, Dutch and British have done. Because they lack the mentality, as a whole, to be a match. What they share, as a whole, is a catholic ingrained belief in large families.
												</p>
												<p>
													Low IQ and high Birth Rate results in societies that don&rsquo;t favor advancement of the whole through the successes of the few but rather maintenance of the whole -as is-, entropically.

													Which is why group-think social norms appeal to the low IQ because they are the safety of self through the slowest-march presence of the herd. But they have nothign to do with what has made whites the dominant global culture even though we now number less than 16% of it&rsquo;s numbers
												</p>
												<p>
													And if you look at historical studies, white birth rates have always been low. It is why we persisted with a serf culture for so long. The notion that subsistence agro induces large families as slave labor is false for the simple reason that primogeniture ensures that only one will get the landed inheritance and even in the comparitively rich fields of Europe, that policy would only lead to disenfranchisement of a huge, wandering, hopeless, homeless, dispossessed class.
												</p>
												<p>
													Instead, farm work was so brutal that it could only provide for small families whose labor went primarily to the estate Lord via his knight sheriff tax collector, irrespective of how bad a year it was or who died in the family.
												</p>
												<p>
													Now add in that enormous mortality rate for women who died giving birth and a general knowledge of effective birth control going all the way back to Egypt (and no, I&rsquo;m talking herbs, not &#8216;technique&rsquo;) and you have a lot of reasons to understand why Europe&rsquo;s historical birth rates were -never- those of China, India or Africa.
												</p>
												<p>
													We have been different from those cultures since the Paleolithic. We have had no choice.
												</p>
												<p>
													If this was not a campaign by Jews and their deluded Liberal friends to destroy whites by denying us the very homeland they claim for themselves, we would take the logical approach of exporting whiteness, through genomic therapy and robotic labor as well as saturation attacks of hygiene and health care improvement via mass manufacture of things like washing machines and refrigerators and the infrastructure to support them. Essentially exporting our Genetic Algorithm rather than importing their&rsquo;s.
												</p>
												<p>
													Instead, what you see is a dedicated pursuit of liberal ideals and capitalist greed, backed by vicious attempt to genocidally annihilate a competitor sub species by &#8216;the usual suspects&rsquo; and whites as a whole suffering for it.
												</p>
												<p>
													This situation is made worse by the Bowling Alone syndrome by which whites no longer even help each other because they perceive that they are no longer helping their own culture as geneline. And so we begin to implode because we refuse to _SIMPLY SAY_: &#8220;Evil or no, we are not going to share what is ours with you. Develop your own.&#8221;
												</p>
												<p>
													And back it with zero growth system that empowers whites, generationally, to wealth levels as personal property rights that DO NOT have to be regenerated through each &#8216;working generation&rsquo;. That is the real key to speciation event. That we stop acting like the medieval peasants we once were and dedicate ourselves, full time, to being creatures driven by and rewarded for being, intelligent.
												</p>
												<p>
													And we were getting damn close to this realization threshold. Until someone decided to spoil things by saying: &#8220;Oh no, we dare not let the whites get ahead, if they won&rsquo;t kill each other off in useless wars then let&rsquo;s pretend they are guilty of more than being successful competing species and force them to invite the serf culture of fatalism and squatter entropy back in from the rest of the world.
												</p>
												<p>
													They come for the soup, they stay for the welfare, is NOT a model for global success.
												</p>
												<p>
													They are too many. We too few. And they (the world&rsquo;s genetically impoverished) are converting our society to look like the ones they left behind.
												</p>
												<p>
													In 1950, we were 27% of the global population, 5 years after a war which killed 100 million.
												</p>
												<p>
													In 2010, we were 16%.
												</p>
												<p>
													In 2060, we will be 9.8%.
												</p>
												<p>
													In 2100, we will be less than 4%.
												</p>
												<p>
													We need no other excuse than that WE SHOULD SUCCEED, no matter what, to avoid The Horde&rsquo;s conquest of our open, bountiful, lands.
												</p>
												<p>
													And smart or not, the easiest way to do that is to harden up lines of demarcation behind which it is made clear that if you don&rsquo;t breed white, as a white, your children will be completely disenfranchised from the benefits of our society.

											Sounds like Engleman would have enjoyed this guy. He certainly saw the Negro race accurately, as an inferior race, and displayed proper abhorrence for miscegenation with them. He would also be pleased to see White homelands swamped with Asians, though, and that does not preserve our race and culture.

									I work for a travel publication (I am on the editorial staff), and it&rsquo;s not what I would call a safe haven for race realists. Most journalists and editors are maddeningly pro-diversity. Heck, most travel companies (airlines, hotels, etc.) also spout this drivel. However, I do talk to one IT guy who is wise to white displacement. I haven&rsquo;t looked too hard for anyone else, though.
								</p>
								<p>
									I recall a Christmas party at my boss&rsquo; house, and we were talking about how the Dominican Republic has a thriving tourism business, but the other half of the island, Haiti, is a basket case. He admitted that the differences were due to more than bad luck from hurricanes. I asked him what the difference was. He said he didn&rsquo;t know. I said I didn&rsquo;t know either.

									I never had problems with expressing my view in public, but I consider myself an identity advocate (thus i support the freedom of association for everyone), because i believe separation is the best solution against ethnic conflicts.<br />
									People are more accepting if you don&rsquo;t exclude anyone, i always say how Whites have the right to exist, have the right to not lose their territory and way of life and it&rsquo;s essential to exclude non-whites to maintain their identity, but I&rsquo;m not indifferent or an hypocrite and always add that i support other ethnic groups to do the same in their territories.<br />
									Tibetans and Indians are a great example to make since people are not going to call the Dalai Lama an &#8220;hater&#8221; for resisting Chinese invasion, they are not going to call Gandhi a racist for not wanting the British in India, otherwise that would make them hypocrites and you just need to call them out on that and it will invalidate their argument against White &#8220;racists&#8221;.

											The social climate is better, some of the pro-immigration types tend to be really anti-racist and are not going to jump at your throat if you don&rsquo;t like immigration, but we have the anti-White extremists too of course, like the people from the &#8220;centri sociali&#8221;, full blown commies anti-Western morons, that protest with the immigrants when something happen, then we have problems with some judges (real commies too) and the present government and its absurd operation called &#8220;mare nostrum&#8221;, instead of blocking the invaders they are taking them in the main land, all over Italy and there are daily protests.<br />
											I don&rsquo;t know how it will end, but many of my fellow citizens are not happy about the whole immigration deal, that&rsquo;s for sure.<br />
											About the kid, anyway I&rsquo;m not too familiar with the Jersey guidos, I&rsquo;ve seen the guys from that vile mtv show, those are not Italian at all, some are even non-whites like snooky i think she is called.

												Oh Lord no. Trash like that can be found all across my degenerating land but I&rsquo;ll not consider some people White, regardless of specific breed.
											</p>
											<p>
												The hard working, life loving, Italians and Italian mixes are still out there, though. There are different strains of mongrel Whites in America, based on regions but ever disappearing even without White genocide. The northeastern Catholic White (Italian-Irish-Polish) has largely blended with the old Yankee stock of Mayflower types with a drop of Indian.
											</p>
											<p>
												Southern White standard is English, Scotch/Irish, French, some Germanic, some Indian in certain places.
											</p>
											<p>
												But since modern transportation and communication, Italian genetics have spread across the country. Like the lovely loud mouthed woman I described. Sigh&hellip;lol&hellip;

													Wilmington is a nice city. I have to admit, it&rsquo;s a very progressive city. It always maintains the highest unemployment in the state because so many people want to live there. It also has the highest accident rate in the state (likely boosted by the fact so many people are there vacationing). They say a fair amount of nasty stuff goes on in Wilmington that isn&rsquo;t talked about much, but it&rsquo;s a very nice city. The local TV stations never show &#8216;The Jerry Springer Show&rsquo;. If you live there you can&rsquo;t get it on cable. I suspect locals would find the show too hard to believe. There are TV and movie production companies in Wilmington. Matlock and One Tree Hill were filled there. And I believe a lot of those shows such as &#8216;Judge Judy&rsquo; draw their &#8216;studio audiences&rsquo; from &#8216;extra&rsquo; pools in Wilmington, NC. I suspect it will be the black hollywood. Funny thing is there seem to be few blacks who work for the studios, aside from extras.

													I remember being in Rome and riding the buses all day and not paying a dime. I remember thinking, &#8216;Communists must control Rome&rsquo;, lol, I think I may have heard something about it. I&rsquo;m still not sure, maybe I was committing a crime. In Portugal, that same year, there were huge elections. Giant murals painted over buildings all over town. The Red party had the hammer and the word I can&rsquo;t spell and the workers marching. The Blue party advertised &#8216;Leadership Competensia&rsquo;. I have photos of these, I could print the actual slogans. I asked someone else and he said the left had won that election. The left messed up bad sometime in the last decade or so and the right have taken over from them. That&rsquo;s the nearest I know about the situation in Portugal now.(outdated it&rsquo;s true).

									<i>But I cannot publicly speak or write about the issue I&rsquo;ve decided is most central: the displacement and dispossession of whites.</i>
								</p>
								<p>
									This is the crux of our problem. If it was easier for consciously pro-white people to go public with their views then things would change much more quickly. The ability to get someone fired is a matter of top-down control. This strongly suggests that the anti-whiteness of our culture was brought about by the elites of our society. The Civil Rights movement, for example, succeeded because the establishment supported the demonstrators. As another example, the leadership of the GOP is to the left of ordinary members.
								</p>
								<p>
									Finding ways to &#8220;walk the line&#8221; in racial discussions is all well and good, but what is really needed is a way to break through the barrier to white advocacy that is imposed by the elites of society. One route for people who want to go public is to first become financially independent. There are trade-offs to be made. People may want to consider that before taking on new responsibilities.

										Multiculturalism and diversity are the end result of top-down bureaucratic collectivism. After all, why would an entire race voluntarily decide to hand over their countries to third world invaders who lack the mental ability to build successful first world societies in their own countries? How did this internationalist seizure of power take place? Leftist intellectuals, disenchanted by the failure of proletarian revolution to achieve any measurable success in western Europe and N. America immediately after WWI, decided that the best way to change western culture would be from within. By gradually infiltrating the dominant social and political institutions of civil society, leftist intellectuals would be able to manufacture a new consciousness and replace the &#8220;false&#8221; consciousness of the old ruling class and bourgeoisie.
									</p>
									<p>
										The leftist intellectuals achieved their greatest successes in the 1960s, when a whole generation of student radicals were seduced by sex, drugs, rock &#8216;n&rsquo; roll and the leftist politics of the Frankfurt School and Che Guevara. The American student radicals who came of age in the 1970s and 1980s only made worse what was begun in the 1960s by traitors of the &#8220;Greatest Generation.&#8221;
									</p>
									<p>
										Yes, the achievement of complete economic independence from Third World American society is good. Grow and hunt your own food, build your own house, generate your own electricity, homeschool your own children etc. It is important that all whites realize that their tax dollars are being used by the feds to subsidize their ethnic cleansing and race replacement. Now it&rsquo;s time to starve that beast. Stop allowing the tyrants to collect your tax dollars! The more whites who abandon this genocidal, anti-white society to create their own parallel, explicitly &#8220;whites only&#8221; societies, the better.

											<i>Multiculturalism and diversity are the end result of top-down bureaucratic collectivism.</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											Don&rsquo;t overlook the role of ethnic group interests. See Kevin MacDonald.
										</p>
										<p>
											<i>Grow and hunt your own food, build your own house, generate your own electricity, homeschool your own children etc.</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											Financial independence primarily means having enough money to live on and also keeping your expenses down, e.g. by living away from the major metropolitan areas. I am talking about how people can get into a position where they can be pro-white advocates without the fear of losing their jobs. If you have no money then you can&rsquo;t get your message out. Don&rsquo;t spend all your time figuring out how to farm and hunt. Save up some money and then spend your time and money getting an explicitly pro-white message out.
										</p>
										<p>
											<i>The leftist intellectuals achieved their greatest successes in the 1960s, when a whole generation of student radicals were seduced by sex, drugs, rock &#8216;n&rsquo; roll and the leftist politics of the Frankfurt School and Che Guevara.</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											Again, don&rsquo;t overlook the role of ethnic group interests. Bad ideas tend to be self-limiting, but when an ethnic group sees a set of bad ideas as serving their interests, and if they have the ability to promulgate these ideas, then they will be harder to get rid of.
										</p>
										<p>
											The fact that whites can&rsquo;t publicly stand up for their own people without losing their livelihoods speaks volumes. If this were just about ideas then people would not be getting fired over it. It is not about ideas. It is about threats and perceived threats.

											If someone speaks up for whites publicly he risks losing his livelihood. This clearly is not about bureaucratic control and collectivism. Think about it. When people get fired it is usually not by bureaucrats. It is by their boss. Look at this for what it is instead of trying to shoehorn it into some sort of libertarian agenda. When I say elites I mean elites. Not just government bureaucrats. I mean people who are higher up on the socioeconomic ladder.

										Also unfortunately, you will run into a lot of liberal white women at a hospital. I guess people who make good money and live apart from non-whites can afford to buy into the egalitarian myth. I can tell you that immigration is a hot button issue across the board these days. People are ticked. It&rsquo;s an excellent icebreaker (unless you live on the West Coast?).

													Nonwhites are incompetent. Imported nonwhites get their degrees from third world diploma mills, in addition to purchasing degrees in mechanical engineering, medicine, law etc. on the black market.
												</p>
												<p>
													Big business loves nonwhites because they don&rsquo;t mind working for low wages and under poor working conditions. Imported nonwhites are grateful to big business because they&rsquo;re getting paid more than the 5 or 10 dollars a day they normally receive in third world countries. From the perspective of big business, this is good because this means the nonwhites will be docile and compliant, unlike many white workers, who are continuously demanding better conditions for themselves and their families. Nonwhites are only here because they&rsquo;re being used by TPTB to ethnically cleanse whitey.

To claim all non-whites are &#8221;so stupid&#8221; makes no sense, you make the same mistake others make who can&rsquo;t seem to grasp the bell curve or the concept of &#8221;average IQ&#8221;.

													You&rsquo;ve made some good points, and I agree with them. However, I&rsquo;m not talking about &#8220;hiding&#8221; our race-realism, but being wise, discretionary and prudent in both HOW and WHOM we choose to discuss these matters. Yes, there&rsquo;s a time to be bold, but we must also be discerning when and when not to open our mouths.
												</p>
												<p>
													Moreover, as I&rsquo;ve already pointed out, our message is NOT for non-whites. There is little about it that will do them any good and, in all likelihood, it will be used against us (especially be blacks).
												</p>
												<p>
													While it&rsquo;s true that some non-whites would probably agree with us, their agreement does little for our cause in the overall scheme of things. I&rsquo;d rather concentrate my efforts on open-minded and reasonable white men and women who would do our cause much more good.
												</p>
												<p>
													Sharing with other whites these great truths is quite another matter, but even then it&rsquo;s better to be wise in one&rsquo;s approach. Many naive whites would rather have us fired from our jobs than hear anything we have to say on racial matters.

											My guess is that, in the Netherlands, you are able to speak more openly about the behavioral traits of non-Whites than we are able to here in the United States. Our country has become irrationally obsessed with political correctness. The average workplace here has no freedom of speech for Whites with racial realist views. I would guess that The Netherlands has a fairly strong spirit of Nationalism, and that one can speak with pride with regards to Dutch culture pretty freely, and that many want to keep their fatherland Dutch. Race is implicit in keeping The Netherlands Dutch. In this country, race is not implicit in a discussion of keeping our land American. Keeping England English, or The Netherlands Dutch automatically includes keeping these lands White. All of the European fatherlands hold this advantage over the colonies.

												at $500,000 per drug resistant TB patient its relevant due to funding all health care. Drug resistance happens because low IQ 3rdworlders get free meds from do gooders, but the 3rdworlders stop taking them when they feel better and sell the rest of the free drugs.

												It will be happening sooner than you might think.

There are also the allegations that some of the &#8220;chilluns&#8221; coming across the border have tested positive for TB exposure and have been waved on rather than quarantined.

											No surprise in Negro/Leftist dominated Cuyahoga County. Between the Negroes, and the Beachwood Leftist Tribe members who love to coddle them, I would expect nothing less from Greater Cleveland. Drive an hour South, and you will be in solid red county territory. The Liberal tribe members from Cleveland continually try to make Ohio resemble NY or Massachusetts, but, South of Canton/Youngstown, we tend to agree with our friends down in good old West Virginia. Ohio became a great state as a result of the society European Americans have built here. Negroes have only destroyed what Whites have created here.

He does not seem to even take seriously the fact that &#8220;death by government&#8221; has befallen hundreds of millions globally during the past century.

													Exactly. The Boer Genocide should be front and center in the media in all Western Nations. The Netherlands should be collaborating with Canada/United States/Australia to give safe new homes to Dutch extraction South Africans, and should also have troops in South Africa aiding the safe escape of White South Africans. The Netherlands should be aiding Boer farmers in resettlement along with aforesaid triumvirate of former colonies, and Great Britain should be partnered with aforesaid triumvirate in aiding White South Africans of British Isles extraction in safe resettlement. That the human rights crisis in South Africa that is the Boer Genocide is not being properly addressed by the European world is proof positive of the extent of anti-White sentiment in our Governments. The Boers are not receiving proper help and support because they are White. No other reason.

											Caucasians of Ashkenazi extraction are an intelligent sub-race of Caucasians. That Ashkenazim are brighter, as a sub-race, than Teutons, Slavs, or Anglo-Celts is not something that I believe. I&rsquo;m aware of what The Bell Curve says about this, but I am not convinced. I believe that Ashkenazim intelligence is on par with aforementioned Caucasian sub-groups, not greater. Greater tested IQ levels result from the Jewish culture of learning, not from inborn genetic superiority.

													Commerce is impossible without finance. Finance is impossible without the payment of interest.

													Money lending was the most important factor in the evolution of the high IQ&rsquo;s of the Ashkenazim. Jews living in Christian Europe were forbidden to own land, and they were excluded from most trades and professions but money lending.
												</p>
												<p>
													Money lending required mastery of arithmetic. Arithmetic was more difficult before the introduction of Arabic numbers. Jews who could not learn the necessary skills did not have children, or they left the faith.

													Much depends on the rate of interest, the acquisition of security in payment default, state provision of coinage, international exchange rates, and especially in recent times the escalation of fractional reserve lending, hedge funds and complex speculation.

												I agree. You and I know that this is true, but Engelman likes living in a dream world where Ashkenazim genes are superior to the genes of other Caucasian sub-races. His thinking is in line with Herr Hitler, who believed that Teutons are a race, not a sub-race of Caucasians, and that Teutons are a genetically superior sub-race to the other Caucasian sub-races. This kind of thinking divides Whites, causing White genocide, and giving power to non-Whites. Engelman&rsquo;s Ashkenazi supremacy ideologies are pie in the sky theories that have no place in White Nationalism. They are the grade of fuel which powered Jewish usurious money lending in Europe, which, in turn, catalyzed Gentile hatred of Jews.

									Well this is a topic that&rsquo;s been on my mind for a while. How to get the message across that you won&rsquo;t sit there and be racially abused without making yourself look like a Nazi or Clansman..
								</p>
								<p>
									I remember that &#8220;What we Call Ourselves&#8221; article and remember suggesting white advocate back when I used to post on here on my Yahoo account (which apparently you can&rsquo;t use anymore).
								</p>
								<p>
									Anyway, I consider myself to be unabashedly Eurocentric and I have never made that a secret to anyone. I tend to keep my opinions to myself. It&rsquo;s the lefties around me who feel the need to agitate in a self-righteous and arrogant manner. When they say particularly egregious things is when I step in. I try to refute their claims in a calm manner. I wear sarcasm like a shield and is one of my strategies when speaking about these issues. Though probably not the best one, I use it because it makes them look like ranting fools. I have learned that it&rsquo;s not what you say it&rsquo;s how you say it. It&rsquo;s all a matter of choosing your words, topics and ideas carefully in order to shift perspectives.
								</p>
								<p>
									Politically I would say that I am a moderate so I can effectively use economic, social and environmental arguments against mass immigration. I use Malthusian and standard of living arguments to good effect. The person that I was talking to pretty much said I was making too much sense.
								</p>
								<p>
									During a conversation I mentioned I wanted to live in Switzerland, which someone felt the need to say it was too white (among other negative things) to which I resoponded &#8220;oh no, too many white people in one place! Somebody call the UN!&#8221; followed by an eye roll. That ended the nonsense.
								</p>
								<p>
									When someone at one point vilified Columbus and the celebration of his birthday I pointed out that nobody had their hands clean during colonial times. I also told someone that he is vilifying the man that made his life possible in the country that he takes for granted. When the whole &#8220;we stole this land from the Native Americans&#8221; argument comes up I point out that this land was conquered as was the norm in the past for people of all races and if they felt so strongly they are on stolen land they should pack their bags and head for Europe.
								</p>
								<p>
									When it comes to Islam I point out that Islam is incompatible with Western civilization and point out the litany of misogynistic, anti-gay, etc. behavior exhibited by its practitioners.
								</p>
								<p>
									When someone on a forum uttered the words &#8220;white devil,&#8221; albeit possibly in a joking manner I pretty much said &#8220;I thank nature every day for being born white. To hell with the detractors.&#8221; When an Asian person made white jokes I made Asian jokes to see if he liked it.
								</p>
								<p>
									One time when the topic of why the US has birth right citizenship came up I said the US was stupid in this regard and the rest of the world is smart. Someone said to me xenophobia is unsustainable,&#8221; to which I responded &#8220;no, overpopulation is unsustainable.&#8221;
								</p>
								<p>
									When I debate these people I try to take the moral high ground from them. I pretty much play psychological games with them.

								</p>
								<p>

									In a work environment I only discuss politics with those who enjoy political discussions, and who can discuss controversial topics without getting angry.

									Many people in any environment - including an internet website - have strong opinions, but they are not well informed. When their opinions are challenged they do not change their minds; they get angry.

									Years ago I thought that I had a list of facts that could change the minds of those who disagreed with me. I have since then learned that people have different values and concerns. They like different things. These are not really debatable.

												I think your wrong in one respect. Whites worship blacks in this country, and frankly, it could be argued, ever &#8216;decent&rsquo; policy this country has ever had has been reversed, because this is true. It&rsquo;s certainly not in whites self-interest to support blacks and their causes, which they have.

												Preconceived views of life and humans do play a role in one&rsquo;s political leanings. However, when someone keeps being confronted with facts and solid logic, or when they get called out on their fallacies, then even if they don&rsquo;t radically change course, they will in the very least become more moderate in their positions and more open to opposing views.
											</p>
											<p>
												<em>&#8220;A political message is only effective if it tells people what they want to believe, or what they know to be true from their lives.&#8221; </em>
											</p>
											<p>
												Well, we&rsquo;re part of what people base their &#8220;truths&#8221; upon. We, as well as our message, are part of people&rsquo;s lives. If our message hits a sensitive spot, or make people see things from another perspective, it could also become what they want to believe.
											</p>
											<p>
												People may want to believe that we&rsquo;re all equal because they think that diversity is the greatest thing, that racial kinship is futile, etc. But if they were made to realize that extreme diversity isn&rsquo;t that great, or that willingly turning themselves into a minority isn&rsquo;t the smartest thing to do, then maybe they would be more open to our stances.
											</p>
											<p>
												My point is that we shape people&rsquo;s beliefs and &#8220;truths&#8221; just as much as anything else. And water-cooler white nationalism is one way to go about doing that.

													I believe that I have an obligation to my people above others and would extend that obligation to even those of my racial family that I very much disagreed with. Perhaps I could convince a White person to, if not think more along my line of thinking, at least get them to be less anti-White or at least less stupid. I may not always agree with my family members but they are always family. If nothing else we need to get the &#8220;progressives&#8221; to see that.

													There is no moral imperative to save any non-White group by Whites simply because: 1) they outnumber us by huge margins; 2) they have their own advocacy groups; 3) they generally don&rsquo;t stick up for us, we give, they don&rsquo;t. Heck, even the Jews don&rsquo;t need us and stab us in the back every chance they get and they are a tiny minority.

													We have been over all this again and again, and as usual you come back with the same old ideas and same old phrases unreconstructed by even the mildest correction. Jews are on average very intelligent, but some of them have other traits that also differ however slightly on average from other &#8220;ethnic groups&#8221;. They have always been known for a certain degree of ethnic &#8220;nepotism&#8221; and a skill at money-making unimpeded by moral criteria accepted by Christians. You can see cultural and temperamental differences just by studying Jewish humor.

												Yep, astronomy is a great way to take a vacation from both non-whites and politics at the same time. That is why I am willing to drive 50 miles or more each way to a dark site where I will be alone and under dark skies with my 10 and 15-inch Dobsonians. I have seen galaxies as far away as 3-billion light years through telescopes up to 25-inches in aperture. With my own telescopes, I&rsquo;ve looked at galaxies as far away as 800-million light years, including the spiral galaxy seen among the other merging galaxies in the photo below.

									global warming is a good topic. It is hard for environmentalists in the workplace to deal with a proposal to limit carbon emissions by limiting immigration from low carbon footprint to the highest carbon footprint countries in the west. The USA has doubled its population unnecessarily, almost entirely due to immigration, which profits only the immigrants themselves and the open border globalist that hire them and pass on all social, economic and environmental costs to the communities,<br />
									another good topic is to bring up how David gelbaum have the sierra Club 100 million on the condition they never talk about how harmful immigration is on the environment.<br />
									Or the 1965 immigration act and read to them the lies Kennedy said when he helped pass it.

									A couple thoughts:
								</p>
								<p>
									It is best to try and stay away from large bureaucracies such as corporations as much as possible, though often that is not a realistic goal. But it should be something to aspire to. If you are good at what you do, it is much harder to drive away your clients when you are self-employed than it is for some human resources idiot to go through the motions of firing you.
								</p>
								<p>
									Beware of &#8220;spies&#8221;. Just like in dictatorships, these are people who are on the lookout for people they can get in trouble with superiors. They may pretend to sympathize but then turn around and&hellip;
								</p>
								<p>
									Most people are cowards. Most people agree with the ideas propounded on this site but don&rsquo;t have the courage to stand up for them. It&rsquo;s always the loudest group that wins, and for now that&rsquo;s our opponents.
								</p>
								<p>
									I&rsquo;d say try and avoid contact with that system as much possible and build kindred networks.

												This site promotes white racial interests, white racial identity and white racial existence. In various ways you oppose all three so you refute yourself. It&rsquo;s the voluminous quantity of your postings (trolling) that makes you fit for banning, however; not the mere fact of your disagreement. Other sites you have attempted to troll have caught on more quickly to your activities and banned you sooner, which has provided an immediate (and potentially permanent, lasting for as long as your ilk is kept out) improvement in the quality of their comments sections.

													You also ignore many facts and realities that dispute your statements. If that&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re opinion, that is your business. To keep repeating it over and over is pointless. Everyone knows what your opinion is already. People see it as a form of harrassment and anti-white racism. It is a form of fanaticism. I suggest that you move onto something else more relevant, such as black on white crime, white genocide, amnesty, etc. If you continue to focus on Asian and Jewish &#8220;supremacy&#8221;, there is a good chance they will ban you.

													You ignore realities and statistics related to Asian gang activity and organized crime. You also ignore stories about Asian criminal behavior from law enforcement professionals, such as strike_team. Koreans actually do eat dogs, but less than they did in the past. East Asians test well, but they never produced any modern inventions. The Japanese and Koreans have created some brilliant innovations. The Chinese tend to produce third rate products using slave labor. South East Asia resembles Mexico. Jews are a varied group. They orignate from all over Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Each Jewish individual reflects his geographical, racial origin, to some degree. ie Western European Jews have a higher average IQ than Ethiopian Jews. They are not all the same person. Not everyone who brings up facts is jealous or a hater.

													Anyhow, you completely missed my point. I was trying to help you, but you keep belaboring the same statements, over and over. Have a disagreement with someone, great, but move on.

													There are billions of Asians in the world. I&rsquo;m sure they have millions of patents registered&hellip;but how about something major like Tesla Motors? (Elon Musk is a white South African.) When have they ever produced any signficant modern invention? You keep ignoring that question and continue to repeat the same mantra. You also ignored my statement on gang activity. And how is Vietnam superior to Scandinavia? As a Vietnamese friend of mine stated, &#8220;Vietnam is a very dangerous, corrupt, and covered with trash. Vietnam makes Mexico look like a nice, clean country.&#8221; Do you know more than a local? I don&rsquo;t generally resent Asians, by the way. Most of the local Asian businesses I know of are &#8220;cash only&#8221;. They are prosperous because they don&rsquo;t pay taxes (or they pay fewer taxes). I actually do resent that, but not out of jealousy. Jews are too diverse to generalize like you commonly do. I am banging my head against the wall. I know you will keep repeating, &#8220;whites are jealous because they are inferior&#8221;, etc. I have tried to be open minded with you, but you are only making people hate you. You are not having an open discussion, you keep ignoring statements and facts presented to you, as usual.

													Some of my favorite posts come from strike_force and Diamond_lil. They are working on the front lines in Los Angeles law enforcement, and public school system, respectively. Their points of view come from daily experience and acquired knowledge. I respect them and enjoy their commentary. Also, there are non-whites on this site whom I respect as well: Korean_guy, Cannot_tell (a very nice young black woman), and occasionally Jewamongyou (who could be classified as white). Your personal experience seems to be based on a small group of friends from your school days. That was very limited contact, and it was decades ago. You speak your idealism from your small apartment and have very little contact with the real world. You do not know more than the other commenters I mentioned. I work with Asia, and I have lived and worked in Asia. I believe I have more knowledge than you about those cultures. You continue to ignore almost all of my statements. For the third time, how can Asians be superior if they have never invented anything signficant in the modern world? I am not saying they are inferior, but how can they be superior to Europeans without these achievements? Why do you indignantly ignore my statements about Asian gang activity? About half of your comments are race realistic statements about blacks. You were mugged by them, and you choose to see the reality on this issue. About half of your other comments are blatant white bashing. In my opinion, that negates anything sensible that you might say. You are extremely offensive, and you do not belong on this site. I encourage people to stop engaging in pointless arguments with you. It&rsquo;s time a number of us stand up and request that you are removed from this site. We have all read your anti-white screed, once too many times.

													According to The Color of Crime, which attracted me to this website, &#8220;Asians commit violent crimes at about one quarter the white rate&hellip;
												</p>
												<p>
													&#8220;Hispanics are 19 times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs. Blacks are 15 times more likely, and Asians are nine times more likely.&#8221;
												</p>
												<p>
													There is no mention of what these Asian youth gangs do. I suspect that they are groups of friends who join together for social purposes and mutual self defense from the blacks and Hispanics with whom Asians often must live. Asians have a lower rate of violent crimes than whites. If they also have a lower rate of property crime, and I am confident that they do, I do not care what Asian youth gangs do.

													Asians are diverse, as are whites. If Jared Taylor made those statements, I question them. I would also need to see the rest of the text. Statements can be taken out of context. I was impressed with Tokyo and Singapore, but Cambodia, Laos, Burma, etc have some serious problems. (Even the worst of places have some decent, intelligent people though). SE Asia is not superior to Western Europe in any way. I have enjoyed the lights and excitement of Tokyo and Singapore, as well as the safe streets&hellip;but who invented those lights? Who invented their automobiles, computers, and skyscrapers? You keep ignoring my succint questions and veering off onto a tangent.

													Jared Taylor&rsquo;s quoted opinion here MIGHT reasonably apply to Chinese minorities in the USA, but not to China itself. You have (of course) ignored the data I have provided on Chinese crime in the USA, and I am not going to dig it out from my files a third time.

													In a single computer screen I can demonstrate that blacks tend to be less intelligent than whites, that they have higher rates of crime and illegitimacy than whites, and that these differences are durable geographically and historically. These are legitimate criticisms of blacks.

													I am not anti semitic. Many of the Jewish people I have known were as race realist as someone you would see on Amren. Many have very European features as well. As a community, they are not perfect. There was a common saying where I&rsquo;m from: &#8220;when the Jews move in, the blacks soon follow&#8221;. I have seen this pattern several times. They allow homes and neighborhoods to get run down, and they sell them to blacks. I have seen this happen in Mattapan (Boston), Beverlywood (Los Angeles), Brooklyn, NY, and various small towns. I am not jealous or mean-spirited. I have simply observed this pattern. To make sweeping generalizations that all Jewish people are intelligent and successful is erroneous. I grew up with Jewish people. Some were doctors, business owners, lawyers, teachers, etc. Many were blue collar and average. Some were even crude, lazy, alcoholic, and criminal. The same description could be applied to Irish, Italian, Scandivian, or German. The Jewish community is not superior to white Christians/non-Jewish.

													Very well written. I&rsquo;m an eighth Ashkenazi descent myself, but those ancestors coverted to Christianity upon settling in America several generations ago, so I think my view on the Jewish question tends to be sensible and balanced. I think that Jewish psychology in America is very similar to White Southern psychology, in that both envision themselves as put upon minority groups due to having been at the losing end of a war. Many Jews are still fighting WWII, just as many White Southerners are still fighting the Civil War. Both groups fail to own up to the misdeeds which put them on the losing end of their respective war. Jews want to pretend that their forebears were not guilty of generations of usurious money lending, which was nothing but theft from European Gentiles. They do not want to admit that they carried on with this far too long, felt no guilt, and that generations of rage were unleashed when Hitler took power. Likewise, Southern Nationalists want to conveniently ignore that their forebears could have ended slavery long before the Civil War, and sent every last Negro back to Africa, solving the problem.

													I agree with Jefferson on this and on several other things he said, even without reference to Ezra Pound.
												</p>
												<p>
													I am not fazed by any actual facts you provide since, unlike some Nordic Episcopalian Zionists, I can correct what I already think and integrate new information into my worldview.
												</p>
												<p>
													How many times are you going to tell us that you personally have always thought Chinese females more beautiful than white, that you liked CPUSA members, that you vote Democrat, that you have read through the whole Bible in seven translations, that you already possess all the facts you need without further study, that you have enjoyed arguments since a child and have always won them, that you alone possess &#8220;the truth&#8221; (as exemplified by the same old quotes you found on AmRen or Nizkor), that you arm yourself in case blacks attack you again, that you nevertheless have all your limbs intact - unlike many &#8220;biologically inferior&#8221; Arab children after a visit by the IDF (I made this last one up).
												</p>
												<p>
													As for your insistence that &#8220;the Jews&#8221; are wholly superior to &#8220;Aryans&#8221; aka &#8220;White Gentiles&#8221;, I suggest you add to your little library of Hitler, Hoffer and Harpending, at least some works by T. Herzl and M. Hess which will show how the &#8220;antisemitism&#8221; question is a good deal more complex, and indeed interesting, than &#8220;your&#8221; endless repeated &#8220;facts&#8221;.

									I know, sometimes, playing the white victim will be seen as the Most racist thing you can possibly do. Probably because, on some kind of unconscious or even reactionary level, they understand that this counteracts this idea of &#8216;black men as ultimate victims in our society&rsquo; that they just know is true, and they will object to this reality being questioned. The conditioning will kick in, lol. I still remember, when The Bell Curve came out, and the subject came up on campus when I was a student, I would always say, &#8220;What a racist. How can he say Asians are smarter than whites&#8221;. I still remember the reaction to this. They will probably rebel against the &#8216;idea&rsquo;, and what you&rsquo;re &#8216;really&rsquo; doing, and not you. They&rsquo;ll react to the argument. Baby steps for them, because if they are white, on some level they do Know that at least some whites (if not whites as a group) are victims. Or course that was 20 years ago?
								</p>
								<p>
									I have a liberal friend who always tries to convert me. He&rsquo;s always trying to modify my behavior and curb my &#8216;racism&rsquo;, &#8216;ignorance&rsquo;, &#8216;bigotry&rsquo; and any idea I have that might seem to him to be coming from a right wing agenda. He&rsquo;s always watching the MSNBC type of news, so he&rsquo;s not fooled. He&rsquo;s open to some racial ideas. &#8216;Tolerance&rsquo;, perhaps, is more so coming to accept that whites, in some cases, are victims, too. It will get there eventually, probably. My friend is sometimes more open to racial ideas than he is to accept ideas that he thinks must be coming from the ignorant and backward right.
								</p>
								<p>
									He probably suspects, that blacks, on average, will turn out to be less intelligent that whites, on average (this is even something I don&rsquo;t believe myself). He probably suspects that Asians are more intelligent that whites. If you choose this angel (asians are smarter than whites) not the method I chose, to be a white advocate, to &#8216;introduce race difference&rsquo; (which the author above wisely advises against), unless you are Jared Taylor himself, the liberal will see what you&rsquo;re trying to do, trying to say that whites are smarter than blacks (I suppose even if, in a rare case, you are not), he&rsquo;ll see you are trying to promote racism, and the liberal will most likely be right. In America everyone is obsessed with blacks. No one cares about whites. Not even white advocates. My friend is not fooled by &#8216;genetics&rsquo; arguments.
								</p>
								<p>
									The liberal, like the Spiny Starfish, can see where your argument is leading to, even if you are making a seemingly innocent comment. For one thing, they see those &#8216;straw man&rsquo; arguments all the time on MSNBC. They all have imaginary ideas on what &#8216;racists&rsquo; or &#8216;republicans&rsquo; think. Most shows on TV seem dedicated to making fun of &#8216;conservatives&rsquo; or conservative ideas. We can yell all we want, most of them are smarter than us (excluding race issues, most likely). It would be wise to consider that. Just try and make friends with them. That&rsquo;s a start.
								</p>
								<p>
									&#8220;Rather than talk about why we don&rsquo;t want to live in black or Hispanic neighborhoods–crime, poor work ethic, anti-white attitudes–we should focus on the solution: the right to live with the people of your choice. This approach draws more sympathy&#8221;.
								</p>
								<p>
									I thought the author was going to suggest pointing out positive attributes of neighborhoods that happened to be whiter. They say you can challenge the status quo in the form of asking open ended, rhetorical, questions. All very good advice in the article.

											I guess it&rsquo;s because Whites can be proud of our people, if you know about your history and accomplishments you can be confident in who you are.<br />
											For example you can take an English stereotype and overplay it, an Englishman might be angry at it first, but in the end they have contributed so much to the world that they will disregard it as something marginal and not be upset about it&hellip; an African? well i don&rsquo;t need to describe their reaction since even mentioning watermelon makes them irrationally angry.

											People in the south tend to be more warm, but the image of the obnoxious Italians that scream and are overemotional is closer to the city of Napoli, they are kinda shunned though, in Italy we have a thing called &#8220;bella figura&#8221; since the communities tend to be strongly tied (especially in little cities and the south) everybody know each other and if you act in a bad manner people are going to talk and you basically get to be known because of what you do, so if you are a moron that talk on people faces and is obnoxious in general, you are going to get stuck with that reputation.<br />
											There are obviously people that just fit in the stereotype, after all it comes from somewhere.<br />
											We tend to be a bit warmer in general, but for example i felt at home in various part of Europe, so we are not all that different.

												My older brother - almost 2 decades - spoke fluent Italian when a naval officer over there many years ago. Stationed mostly in la Sardinia, but traveled throughout the country. Kinda Robert Redford like with a little nerd steak, he was apparently quite popular with the girls, if that hot commie chic who came to visit him after he came back or those artfully done black and white photos I found cleaning out his drawers are any indication.<br />
												My father, a generation earlier had fought in Italy against the Nazis, after the collapse of Mussolini&rsquo;s gubbamint. Or was is right before. My crazy Scarlett O&rsquo;Hara mom was brutal on the old man and one of his favorite passive aggressive tactics was to tell the story of an Italian countess who got him, a junior officer, flown to a bigwig party on one of the seven hills of Rome.<br />

									Very important subject.
								</p>
								<p>
									My advice is &hellip;
								</p>
								<p>
									No, do not do water cooler race realism. Keep work and even graduate school and race politics seperate .
								</p>
								<p>
									I was burned very badly when I was an MBA student at Stern New York a University supposedly the #1 MBA program in the USA. I made the mistake of agreeing to attend a teaching assistant &#8220;party&#8221; to watch the Vice Presidential debate between Dan Quayle and Loyd Benson. The TAs and the Woman Prophessor were all ragging on Dan Qualye saying how terrible, evil and stupid he was. I just said &#8220;he was a Midwestern White guy like me and what was wrong with that?&#8221;.
								</p>
								<p>
									I got blacklisted and didn&rsquo;t receive any job interviews, let alone job offers. Later it got back to my graduate school and high school that I had worked on David Duke&rsquo;s campaign for governor.
								</p>
								<p>
									🙂
								</p>
								<p>
									So, my advice is to not discuss religion or politics let alone race realism politics around the water cooler.

									The exceptions are Mario Cuomo and his terrible don Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The current race mixing Committed mayor of New York City isn&rsquo;t really Italian, he changed his name to appeal to anew Yorkers who respect Italians.

									In the world of make believe, such as education, entertainment, and government, being a white male is a horrible curse, and we are becoming a hated minority in our own countries. In the real world, where one must produce, the situation is quite different. For example, I work in exporting. Almost all of my customers are non-white. They are Asian, hispanic, Arabic, and black African. A small percentage are white Europeans. I like almost all of them, and I appreciate their business. They come to me because I am white and they know I probably won&rsquo;t rip them off. Would they do business with a black Nigerian, a fellow Venezuelan, a Chinese trader on a secret island?&hellip;not a chance in hell. They don&rsquo;t want to get ripped off. Even blacks dont trust other blacks. My black African customers pay in advance and high five me. They love me. I am a &#8220;horrible racist&#8221;, but I don&rsquo;t steal from anyone. I go out of my way to help my customers, and I would use my own money to fix a problem. I don&rsquo;t care what color the person is, I give them 1000%.That is a white attribute&hellip;most others would steal from them. In the real world, being a white male is a positive attribute. White privilege actually does exist (because of honesty and hard work). Liberals and the federal government virulently hate white males&hellip;but they don&rsquo;t produce anything. Eventually that will all collapse.

									I wouldn&rsquo;t follow this author&rsquo;s advice. You are bound to get ostracized or even fired. I would concern troll, and tear down arguments as they come. Example:
								</p>
								<p>
									Me: my neighborhood is so White (shrug)<br />
									Them: yeah, that must be so bad<br />
									Me: why would you say that? I like it<br />
									Them: it must be dull and vanilla and boring<br />
									Me: actually no, the families are quite different and fun. We all have dinner parties, and our kids play together. Some people are doctors, some lawyers, others musicians and teachers. Quite a diverse group.<br />
									Them: but everybody looks the same and the food must be bland.<br />
									Me: There is so much variety. Don&rsquo;t tell my wife but the redhead next door is quite something. There are some brunettes and blondes, tall and average height. Long hair shrt hair. blue eyese, brown eyes. Serious folks, this one funny guy who invents limericks it seems on the fly. the food at these parties is great. We have creme brulee, pasta sometimes, greek roasts and yoghurt, brisket, corn bread, paella, hot dogs, Genoa salami, pizza, crepes, you name it! What do you like to eat?<br />
									Them: I like curries and jerk chicken and mergez sausage. I cook it myself.<br />
									Me: so you just get the recipe. You don&rsquo;t for you, right?<br />
									Them: um yeah, sure but it&rsquo;s more fun with them. Plus ther music is cool.<br />
									Me: so you live around a lot of diversity? You have many minorities as frien

									Good article!!! In Canada, the epitome of political correctness, it is problematic to say the least! I work in a politically correct environment as do most of my friends. Privately many people share my frustration but i have to be very careful when introducing Amren articles in general. the Post WW2 liberal establishment has seized the day. Many genuinely believe in racial harmony and hold the White race culpable for all evil in the World. Radical feminism is one of the biggest problems faced by the White race. Sadly I know many White rat bastards that would sell their own people out at the drop of a hat. Canada is in bad shape people!

									My take: Yes, I appreciate that there are things you can&rsquo;t say at work. I don&rsquo;t either. I want to keep my job. It is verboten for a White person to criticize a government approved &#8220;oppressed&#8221; group of people. But there are ways I use to undermine our enemies anyway. I constantly drop phrases like &#8220;liberal media&#8221;; &#8220;leftist college professors&#8221;; &#8220;PC point of view&#8221;; &#8220;racist position&#8221; (used against blacks), etc. What the cumulative affect of all these is, while not attacking any race or ethnic group, is to constantly undermine anti-White arguments and positions on every issue. I am thus undermining the very institutions of liberal multiculturalism: Colleges, news media, politicians, even non-White leaders themselves, along with White defenders of non-Whites. I have learned to use the same tactics that the Left has used so successfully against us. Undermine the enemies beliefs and chip away at the very foundation until the whole structure collapses. That is what we can do even in a workplace that censures free speech.

												The overwhelming majority of black doctors are AA. Matriculated whites score an average of about 35 on the MCATs (out of top score of 45); about 17 for blacks. If they didn&rsquo;t have AA there wouldn&rsquo;t be many black doctors but those who made it would have some respect.

									I go to liberal sites and advocate for whites with the most clarity I can muster. I am retired so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about getting fired, which for many I know is a real concern. I try to be your white surrogate and speak for the silenced.<br />
									The usual reaction I get from non-whites is not a plea for equality or civil rights; it&rsquo;s a warning for the revenge they seek. It&rsquo;s liberals who got them in this frame of mind by telling them that whites are the reason they&rsquo;re &#8220;oppressed&#8221;. If you&rsquo;re on the fence concerning race relations, I give you fair warning that someday your life may depend on the decision you make.

										Ah yes, the &#8216;Angry Brutha&rsquo; syndrome. It&rsquo;s a wonder this isn&rsquo;t more widespread and virulent than it is. Blacks have been taught from the moment they can understand it that they are being held back, used, victimized and looked down upon by whitey, and that society owes them EVERYTHING. You take a reasonable and intelligent people and brainwash them with that and you would have trouble. How much more so with a people that have low impulse control and poor future time orientation ?

									Actually, I became a paleo-conservative back when I was still saying that race was a way to divide people and blacks should get off &#8220;the liberal plantation.&#8221; So once can be a paleo but not be hip on race. Granted, we paleos are VERY fertile grounds for the message, but we still have to take it to them, as it was taken to me. Now race has risen from &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; to the MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE because, if we&rsquo;re not here or are a powerless minority, then no other issue matters. Race is the threshold issue to all other issues.

										I respectfully disagree with you, mike. The damage done by Jews who promote immigration in traditionally gentile-white countries only is certainly enormous, but that does not mean the value of Jared&rsquo;s influence is unimportant. I believe Jared&rsquo;s methods of describing our plight while generally avoiding attacks against other ethnic groups is very powerful because it makes the intentions of his detractors much more obvious. For example, Jewish individuals who express animosity against Jared or Jared&rsquo;s ideas don&rsquo;t do so because Jared said anything bad about Jews. They do so only because they hate gentile-whites. They&rsquo;re showing their hand in a way which is much more obvious than it would be if they opposed someone who expressed ill will toward Jewish people.

											I think you missed the point. They are simply an alien group warring on Whites as well, moreover, sounding the bugle and leading the charge.

									I think the author is both right and wrong. I never talk to coworkers about this. That&rsquo;s foolish. However, I always talk to clients. Why? I don&rsquo;t have to see them every day if there is a problem. Also, it&rsquo;s my word against theirs. If there is a problem then it gets chalked up as a &#8220;learning experience.&#8221;
								</p>
								<p>
									I&rsquo;ve never had a problem with clients. I&rsquo;ve also never opened up to coworkers. Some have opened up to me about illegal immigration, Amnesty, and the future of America. I can&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s anyone who believes America is going to survive. Liberals think evil, White, Racists will destroy America. I&rsquo;m not kidding. I live in California so this is quite common to hear. However, other&rsquo;s believe we&rsquo;ll just go bankrupt and look like Mexico. No one talks about Whites or the future of the White race but me. And I never talk about that with coworkers. There&rsquo;s pretty much no point unless I had another job lined up.

									You&rsquo;d be shocked how many people actually believe in the tenants of race realism. Even in the NYC area. Many white people I work with speak in lingo. We give each other &#8220;the look&#8221;. For example, &#8220;Jamal is on break…again…&#8221; and people roll their eyes as if to say &#8220;of course…he&rsquo;s black and lazy&#8221;. People are well aware of race differences. A perfect example is basketball and jumping ability. White people seeing black people dunk always seem to be in awe. But why? Can&rsquo;t whites do it easily if we just try hard? Nope. We don&rsquo;t have the same explosive muscle fibers. And you can look at other whites and they just &#8220;know&#8221;. In the same way that whites are in awe of black jumping ability, blacks are in awe regarding whites and how smart we are. They know we are just different.
								</p>
								<p>
									I always get a good laugh when I talk to my grandmother and say &#8220;Yeah, there&rsquo;s a new guy at work…black guy&#8221; and she says &#8220;oh no…&#8221;. I really admire her generation…they were one of the last to be totally blunt and honest and refuse to apologize for their views. But the point is, she knows too. We all know there are massive differences in racial ability and behavior. I went crabbing from a dock recently in a 95% white town (0.6% black) and saw a black guy in a beat down car parked with his car on just sitting in there staring. I kept my eye on him and I noticed other whites who were nearby kept glancing over. We just KNOW. Blacks are a threat. They are just different. No one will come right out and discuss IQ differences, but fellow whites definitely give &#8220;the look&#8221;.

									All good advice. Fortunately my life is now free of office politics. Unfortunately, though, it is not just about not getting fired. Many people hope to get promoted. Lots of luck with that if you become known as a White advocate. Even if your superiors are not hostile to you, they will not want anyone promoted who will raise the likelihood of multimillion-dollar lawsuits.

									Biggest Example of a mixed society being a mess and why we need separation is Brazil and yes I agree we are better off living alone but the fact is their is always trouble makers who want to wreck everything. There are very few jobs were people can discuss race relations in the open without getting fired or having your thoughts recorded. It is fine for Black in Govt to call for a race war and death of blacks but you criticize their black Pres. then you are a racist. If they bring about the violence then maybe that will be the proof that we really do need to live separate and bar them from entering our lands at all costs. It is do or die.

									By the way, I don&rsquo;t think feng shui is necessarily mumbo jumbo. The earth is magnetic, we are made out of electricity, so, for example, one should sleep head to north feet to south. Having a front door that opens to the street could be a safety issue - you get a car flying down the street, go through the intersection, into your front door. If you open the door and you see the bathroom, they believe their money will fly out the door. Russians don&rsquo;t think you should whistle inside your house or you&rsquo;ll lose your money.

									I don&rsquo;t want all Chinese moving to the USA, but I&rsquo;d rather have a Chinese neighbor than a Trayvon. Also, Chinese aren&rsquo;t out to upgrade their genetic line by breeding with whites the way blacks and hispanics are. one could cut off an inchoate relatioship between one&rsquo;s white child and a Chinese kid by talking to the Chinese parents. They will very likely cooperate in ending the relationship.

									&#8220;Races are inherently different. These differences make any multiracial society an ungovernable mess. We&rsquo;d all be better off living separately, or at least acknowledging racial differences and allowing for them in public policy. Open immigration, affirmative action, color-blindness, forced diversity, heavy government spending–all these policies are bound to fail, because equality can&rsquo;t be legislated.&#8221;<br />
									This is exactly what the Separate Development / Apartheid policy in South Africa recognised. The British promulgated the first legislation to manage this reality in The Cape Colony post 1806. The legislative trail up to 1990 can be followed in www. O&rsquo;Malley Heart Of Hope / <a href="http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/</a> when the policy was abandoned and all segregationist legislation has been systematically removed from the statute books. Prior to this the UN passed a resolution declaring Separate Development &#8220;A Crime Afgainst Humanity&#8221; To see what has become of Nelson Mandela and Bishop Tutu&rsquo;s Rainbow Nation Utopia post 1994 visit: <a href="http://sunettebridges.co.za/" rel="nofollow">http://sunettebridges.co.za</a> Click the buttons: News; Articles; and Wall of Remembrance

									I just retired, but I&rsquo;m old enough to remember when whites thought nothing of using language that would get them fired or imprisoned today. What this means is that whites are no longer dominant in the US. Non-whites have the power to determine what can be said in public and what cannot. And this in a country where whites are still 60%+ of the population. The only way whites can return to a country like we knew in the 60s is to return to a population like we knew in the 60s &mdash; that was 88% white. Water-coolers aside, who believes whites today are up to doing what that would require?

											When JFK was elected Prez, the US was 90-10 wh*te. And that wasn&rsquo;t enough, as we now know. I think Israel is making a mistake with its minority policy. Most of the Israeli Arabs will become a 5th column the minute Israel is truly threatened. No matter how many adjustments to reality are made, operating from a Leftist perspective means that every initial response is going to be wrong.

												True, but part of that 90% counted as &#8220;White&#8221; 50 years didn&rsquo;t identify at all with traditional European America.

									The Greeks were not Northern Europeans and they are not mixed sorry! The Southern Europeans are the same as they have been since generations ago. The amount of foreign admixture they have is completely negligible and not enough to affect the overall population. They look different because the environment of Southern Europe pressures their phenotypes to look different.<br />
									Northern Europeans couldn&rsquo;t even start civilization by the time the Romans expanded into the Rhine river and there were many rivers in Germany then to start civilization. This stupid internet rumor of Northern Euro&rsquo;s jumpstarting civilizations is a stupid made up fantasy on the internet without historical basis. Otherwise your points on Islam is spot on!

										You are dead wrong.

										Then you have several centuries of warfare with the cultures of Asia Minor (Troy) and Crete (The Bull is not what you think it is), along with multiple iterations of natural disaster related to tidal waves, volcanism and internecine warfare between Mycenaean cultures as well as between them and displaced migratory populations, all with the result that a gravely weakened Greek state is overrun when the first Greek Dark Age occurs, fragmenting and dispersing the culture across the Mediterranean as survivors of a pogrom like genocidal occupation from the North and East.
									</p>
									<p>
										It is important to note here that this period did not last half as long as it was said to have (from the two kings lists and falsely attributed pottery shards among others, nobody thinking to ask if multiple kings might co-rule over the same lands or similar pottery types meant diaspora of similar culture groups rather than &#8216;reinvention of the wheel&rsquo; etc.).<br />
										Which in turn means that whatever caused this upheaval was both _very_ severe in it&rsquo;s effects and quite sudden in it&rsquo;s onset.
									</p>
									<p>
										The genetic donais of the marauders from Asia, likely Turkic or Altaic steppe cultures, are what gives modern Greeks their characteristic stocky stature; dark, flashing eyes and swarthier appearance.<br />
										Even as they are nothing like the historical tradition of earliest pre-Classical Greece.
									</p>
									<p>
										So, while it is true then that modern Greeks have retained some fraction of their intellectual greatness (forced to flee into other cultures, there was great pressure upon them to be &#8216;very clever indeed&rsquo; to retain a separate identity and yet for all this, it is likely this is the group from which the Jews stole their myth of enslavement and escape in Egypt).
									</p>
									<p>
										But they have also lost their original cultural as racial identity, which is as North Europeans.
									</p>
									<p>
										Given what we know of the phenotype, from derivative variants of the M1CR gene and associated Y factor mutations, that place it as as having arisen only sometime in the period 6,000-10,000BCE, it is almost impossible for these First Greeks to have come from anywhere else but the Latvia/Belarus region where the trait first came forth.
									</p>
									<p>
										All of which highlights exactly the problem which we face today.
									</p>
									<p>
										Believing that cultural interchange without a secure homeland and dominant control over our own interests will lead to anything but repetition of this outcome as the destruction of our best traits and lost-forever civilization is a fools hope which has NEVER been supported by historical reality.
									</p>
									<p>
										Be it Egypt and Kush or Valens and the Visigoths. Or Islam and the Roman remnants of an already Judeo-Christian fragmented Mediterranean Classical society.
									</p>
									<p>
										The multicult kills whether it is overrun or invites it&rsquo;s destroyers in, willingly, stupidly.
									</p>
									<p>
										You are ontop or you are _dead_ as other groups help themselves to all you have and then demand not just the golden eggs but eventually the goose her pretty girl self.<br />
										Until you have nothing.<br />
										Refusing to note this repeated cultural suicide factor is a psychopathology among the egalitarian left that is utterly, genocidally, crazed.

									White Christians are the most anti-white. They feel noble in welcoming minorities to our country. They feel that all people should have an opportunity to live here. Christianity has destroyed the sanity of the white man, just as the apostle Paul knew it would when he preached the gospel. America is doomed because of some Jew who lived 2000 years ago.

									Dear John,
								</p>
								<p>
									I found a new man and&hellip;<br />
									No, I want to ask why the greatest source of political power in the USA is not harnessed and used to address your concerns. This power is so substantial, once released it cannot be ignored and stands to end most, if not all, of your/our complaints. Blue Collar White Males, BCWMs are the group of whom I write. Leftists knew this group amounted to substatial votes and stood to derail their vote for stipend/subsidy political alliance. So, from the beginning of their race policies, they initiated plans to marginalize and restrict and remove BCWMs Civil Rights and thereby their political power. BCWMs are sent to the back of proverbial bus in today&rsquo;s society. They lack the education and money to fight back and the political Right refuses to champion their cause - restoring their civil rights enumerated in the 1964 act. Collectively, this group amounts to approximately 30 million uncast votes - add their wives and that number gets so large it casts a threatening shadow - no wonder the Left fears them. BCWMs Do Not Vote! They do not trust either political party. They view them as no different - because neither will advance their plight. Most presidential campaigns are won by a margin of 5 million votes in a &#8220;Landslide&#8221;. Get out half of these votes and the political landscape shifts goes seismic immediately. The Left would soil their union suits. This number of votes could not be ignored - the past 50 years (the same amount of time as segregation) alongside the fundamental rights enumerated in the 1964 civil rights laws, is more than enough time to argue ending AA laws and revisiting the other race laws that have deprived the essential civil rights of these men. Educated whites, who shut their mouths in fear and whose credentials permit them to advance in the current racial environment, will find a voice once the BCWM vote is resurrected. Significant and meaningful changes can only occur with BCWMs votes - Congress, the courts, government employment laws and government employees will face new pressures they thought was were silenced and neutered. These men are the last considered if considered at all for employment and admissions to any operation where gov&rsquo;t dollars and policies are implemented. The white race is divided and largely conquered due to the politics of division. BCWMs are the largest white voting bloc! United with others will present an undeniable force to smash the race, sex, sexual behaviors cabal.
