And because of their low IQ, they didn&rsquo;t realize the implications: acknowledgment of IQ would remove the biggest White excuse of all - that Whites are uniquely evil and their ineffable hatred for darker hues causes them to hold Blacks and Browns down. If poor Black outcomes are not explainable by White perfidy, then the responsibility for Black failure shifts to Blacks themselves.<br/>
.<br/>
Do spoiled children respond well to correction from either no-nonsense adults or cold hard reality? Rarely. Liberals are right to fear the tantrum that they themselves ultimately cause. Further, will Blacks be content to drive a bus and live lives of modest compensation, when they already have no clue - due to their low IQs - as to how wealth is created? Sad to say, as long as they live amongst us, the pressure of leftist agitation and their own magical thinking will constantly push us back in the direction of cultural Marxism and White accommodation.</p>

Eugene Terreblanche is a good example of where such thinking leads.

<p>The SA government usually forces businesses to hire two to do a job - a black for the &#8220;job&#8221;, then hire a white to actually do the work. If the Boer farmers got rid of their black farmhands and replaced them with poor white Afrikaners, the ANC-controlled SA government would swoop down on them in an instant&hellip; also, I think once word got out that the Boers were hiring only whites, the genocide against the Boer farmers would escalate. </p>

If you listen to any old Lefties, or read their writings, you&rsquo;ll see instantly that the Great Depression was their heaven-on-earth. They loved it so much that they intended for it to continue the minute we&rsquo;d saved the USSR in WW II. The historic event that was the GOP landslide in 1946 was the only reason the rationing and economic controls that the New Dealers had instituted in 1933, and significantly tightened during the War, were scuttled. And that alone ended the 1929-1945 Depression.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-551661" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&rsquo;ve always found low IQ to be a bit of a canard&hellip;..mostly because so few people understand IQ, intelligence, normative testing and the like. There are three issues here. The last is the only important one with regard to blacks.</p>
<p>1. For 3000 to 5000 years, depending on how reliable you insist your historical record be, humans have gotten along just fine with a civilization where only a tiny handful of people need to be intelligent while the rest need not be any more intelligent than the cows they are sheparding. This is getting more, not less true in the modern era. Sure, you must have at least a normal IQ in order to engage a first world way of living (that is what it really means to have a normal IQ). Often, but not always, your status will be higher, the smarter you are. But if you are dumb as a rock, you&rsquo;ll hardly starve. In fact, you can be as dumb as a rock and still have most first world luxuries. In our society, an out and out retard still lives in a heated/air conditioned home, sleeps in a soft bed and has plenty of food and other needful things, even if he does think the white man&rsquo;s magic creates it all out of nothing. It really is not a big deal to provide these things for a nation, as long as the number of retards doesn&rsquo;t get out of hand. Which is to say, we can tolerate the negro as long as his presence isn&rsquo;t dysgenic. Unfortunately, it is starting to be.</p>
<p>2. Negros are not simply dumb as rocks. This is not an issue of them simply having less of a trait (intelligence) than white people. That is neither what low IQ in an individual, nor a population means. A person who is not as smart as another, can often do much, if not most of what that smarter person does, by applying more effort. And here is where almost all white people, including 99% of white nationalists fail to &#8220;get it&#8221;. Negros are mentally defective. IQ does not measure an amount. It measures people who are different than &#8220;normal&#8221; on a test and then sees what that means. Blacks are different than us. How they are specifically different from us is they are unable&hellip;.completely unable to cooperate, integrate, and contribute to a first world standard of anything. This is an extreme source of conflict and confusion among whites. Most white people assume blacks can get something, contribute something, become something if only they apply themselves. This is untrue and not possible. It is unreasonable to expect and will always fail.</p>
<p>3. And it is also not the problem at all. So what if blacks will never be able to read? There are still many, many ways, normal, unskilled labor can, and has contributed to every civilization, including our current one.<br/>
The problem is, blacks are evil. The problem is not that they don&rsquo;t contribute to society. It&rsquo;s that they destroy it. Turn your back on one and he will put a knife in it. Feed them and they reproduce and turn into a menace. They rape, rob, murder and assault right up to the limits physical restraint, violence and death are used to stop them&hellip;.and continuously test those restraints. Best case scenario&hellip;..Haiti. Under a military police state of US soldiers forcing negros to behave, Haiti did pretty good&hellip;..twice. And for extended periods of time. Both of these times, the very second white people stopped forcing them, they immediately and dramatically engaged in rape, robbery, murder, assault&hellip;.even cannibalism and human sacrifice. The recent earthquake in Haiti finally tore up most of the foundations of the cities white people built for them but they were in rubble long before then</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the mental defection white people need to address about blacks. It&rsquo;s this universal, innate propensity for evil. To say blacks are uncivilized isn&rsquo;t even the point. They are anti-civilization. A clearly observable and documentable pattern of behavior that holds true anywhere they are in appreciable numbers. Every country. Every time in human history.</p>
<p>The normal check and balance to such a thing is death. Blacks in Africa and elsewhere have a tendency to barely hang on with extremely low survival value. Most of their groups cling to edge of extinction. The last 50-100 years or so, white people have done something heinous and unnatural. We compensated. Fed them. Clothed them. Never asking why they were on the cusp of extinction in the first place. At best, this was hubris. Eventually, blacks will outpace the ability of whites to compensate for them and then a catastrophe will wipe most of them out. It is literally inevitable.</p>
<p>The question is&hellip;..will they take us all with them.</p>

<p>Blacks will do whatever they&rsquo;re <i>allowed</i> to get away with: murder, rape, torture, robbery and hackings to death in the most vile, brutal manner possible. I&rsquo;m convinced they enjoy it.</p>
<p>This was the basis of apartheid laws and segregation in the old south. It is a mistake to allow blacks around us and our children <i>ever</i>, in <i>any</i> capacity. There must be 100% segregation from blacks at all times, in all circumstances for an area to be considered safe for Whites. They must not be allowed to work in our homes and places of business. </p>
<p>If someone wanted to destroy Western civilization and, especially the Whites that created it what better way than to use blacks as a terror force against White Americans by forcing them into our schools, neighborhoods and cities to unleash violence, murder and mayhem? Do that and then meet <i>any</i> resistance with government force.</p>
<p>Wait a few years for blacks to do their dirty work: utter destruction of White cities (Detroit, Camden NJ, parts of Philly and New York City, Miami, etc.), metro lines that bring blacks into white areas so they can mob, assault and create havoc for Whites, move Section 8 housing into all-white areas, settle refugees from the most depraved parts of Africa into the Whitest communities possible in places like Idaho and Maine, cover up and then justify blacks-on-white-crime and murder against Whites, blame all black violence as a normal and reasonable reaction to racist oppressive Whites&hellip;well, you get the idea.</p>
<p>There is a truly evil, hidden agenda that being carried out by the government that must be destroyed, an agenda to destroy White civilization and Whites along with it. Blacks are being used to carry out this hateful anti-White agenda and are nothing more than naturally violent, low IQ, useful idiots and cudgels used to destroy White American history, heritage and culture.</p>
<p>We could take care of the black problem easily if we were allowed to; violence met with extreme violence to drive blacks away from us and out of white areas. Any violence against Whites would be met with three times the violence against blacks until they got the message that any continued violence against white children will be met with immediate death.</p>
<p>That is the ONLY thing that will work.</p>

<p>So? He <i>governed</i> like he believed the complete opposite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks will erupt in fury&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to race riots involving blacks and whites in the United States, the year 1963 was a turning point. Before then, almost all of them were white riots. After, almost all of them were black riots. Riots are not an expression of powerlessness, they are an expression of power, of victory. Notice sports riots happen because a team wins or the rioters think that a team that came close to winning but didn&rsquo;t should have. The cellar dweller team&rsquo;s fans don&rsquo;t riots. Cubs fans haven&rsquo;t had an occasion to riot in an extremely long time. Blacks started rioting after 1963 not because they lacked civil rights and other &#8220;rights,&#8221; but because they had attained them. Whites stopped rioting in a racial fashion after 1963 because they thought they lost racial power. Therefore, telling black people about racial differences in IQ won&rsquo;t make them riot, in fact, if it accomplishes anything, it will make them less likely to riot, and in fact may make white people more likely to riot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black pathologies ramped up starting in the early 1960s&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, corresponding with the start of the legislative success of the civil wrongs movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks not insulted by real honest dialogue about race&#8221;</p>
<p>I think the few blacks that actually try thinking, i.e. not the typical denizen of Bell Curve City whose only concerns are his foodstuff consumption, gratuitous consumption of bling and libido, they hate more than anything people who they think are phonies. The blacks who were pleased by Jared Taylor&rsquo;s honesty think that your typical egalitarian-lite conservative Republican is lying to them when they put on egalitarian airs. I happen to think the only people they&rsquo;re lying to is themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asians dominating CSIT-STEM courses in college&#8221;</p>
<p>Their propensity to cheat and cram in high school gets them into college. College courses tend to expose that some and many of them wash out.</p>
<p>&#8220;How to get black people to hate white people&#8221;</p>
<p>A common argument against real honest dialogue about race is &#8220;stereotype threat.&#8221; I think the real danger is the opposite: If we fill the heads of young blacks with egalitarian fantasies, and when reality inevitably doesn&rsquo;t turn out that way, then they&rsquo;ll solve the paradox with anti-white violence.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-551162" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good point. Yes, riots are not an expression of the powerless. They are an expression of the powerful. The German people did not engage in Kristal naught because of powerlessness toward the Jews; it was orchestrated and people went along because they knew the powers that be condoned and supported the violence. The same with the growing &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; by blacks against Whites. Strange how they became more common when the first black became president. </p>
<p>More to the point, violence and criminal behavior are NOT caused by powerlessness or by low self esteem. They are caused by people who have an entitlement mentality. More power and higher self esteem only encourage this mentality more.</p>
<p>Blacks need to relearn humility. As White Southerners knew: They need to stop being &#8220;uppity.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that, the government and media started to justify black rioting as a normal reaction to White racism and oppression and it is Whites who were punished.</p>
<p>One example, of many:</p>
<p>&#8220;On July 27, 1919, an African-American teenager drowned in Lake Michigan after violating the unofficial segregation of Chicago&rsquo;s beaches and being stoned by a group of white youths. His death, and the police&rsquo;s refusal to arrest the white man whom eyewitnesses identified as causing it, sparked a week of rioting between gangs of black and white Chicagoans, concentrated on the South Side neighborhood surrounding the stockyards. When the riots ended on August 3, 15 whites and 23 blacks had been killed and more than 500 people injured; an additional 1,000 black families had lost their homes when they were torched by rioters.&#8221;</p>

<p>First off, noticed that both blacks and whites rioted.</p>
<p>Second, even though blacks were powerless in the country as a whole in 1919, in Chicago they were pandered to and groveled to as they were pouring into Chicago moving there from Mississippi coming north on the Illinois Central railroad line. Blacks participated in race riots in Chicago in 1919 because they felt racially empowered in Chicago. Two years earlier, there were race riots in another Illinois city well downstate: East St. Louis. Entirely done at the hands of white people.</p>
<p>There would not have been a black riot in the Deep South in 1919.</p>

<p>Nobody ever did anything indecent to them, it&rsquo;s all a big lie, they started it, all evil flows from them, we are utterly innocent in our own genocide, poor, good, folk who are just powerless dupes and victims of the clever ones who despite their godlike nature, do not have 15 points average IQ on us. They&rsquo;re just clever in an evil and sneaky way, while we are always good and honest.</p>
<p>External locus of control. Sometimes it is legitimate, but too much ascription of outside perfidy to explain personal shortcomings is the sign of something other than sanity.</p>

<p>Now the Japanese offered to take them off Hitler&rsquo;s hands and settle them in Manchuria and other Asian conquests to help develop and industrialize the places. That would have endeared them to the Manchurians, I&rsquo;m sure. When the Nazis tried to get the Japanese to hand over the tiny east Asian Jewish community or just kill them themselves, the Japanese hesitated. After a meeting with the top Jewish Rabbi in the area, who pointed out the non-Aryan nature of the Japanese, the &#8220;Asiatic&#8221; origen of the Jews, and posed a &#8220;what if&#8221; sort of question about the nature of a post Axis victory world&hellip;</p>
<p>The Japanese refused to hand over or kill their Jews.</p>
<p>There is also evidence that Franco decided against entry into WW2 on the Axis side because he knew what Hitler was doing to the Jews.</p>

<p>It has been shown to you on numerous, repeated occasions that Jews made up the majority of the Bolshevik party. Why do I keep having to post this again and again? </p>
<p>What is it you don&rsquo;t get, Engelman, about the Russian Revolution? You are woefully ignorant of history:</p>
<p>Even the Jews brag about their roll in the revolution:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was the work of Jewish planning and Jewish dissatisfaction. Our plan is to have a New World Order. What worked so wonderfully in Russia is going to become reality for the whole world.</p></blockquote>
<p>-The American Hebrew, September 10, 1920</p>
<blockquote><p>In the Bolshevik era, 52 percent of the membership of the Soviet communist party was Jewish, though Jews comprised only 1.8 percent of the total population</p></blockquote>
<p>– Stuart Kahan, The Wolf of the Kremlin, p. 81</p>
<p>Russian president Vladimir Putin has said that Jews made up &ldquo;80 to 85 percent of the first government of the Soviet Union&rdquo; following the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.</p>
<p>Putin&rsquo;s speech, made on June 13 2013, was reported by the official Jewish Telegraphic Agency in an article six days later dealing with Putin&rsquo;s visit to the Moscow &ldquo;Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the JTA report, Putin said with reference to a library belonging to Rabbi Joseph I. Schneerson, the late leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, that he &ldquo;thought about something just now: The decision to nationalize this library was made by the first Soviet government, whose composition was 80-85 percent Jewish.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Jews instigated, carried out and were responsible for the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia that ended in the deaths of 60 million Russian citizens before it was over.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The Jewish Role in the Bolshevik Revolution and Russia&rsquo;s Early Soviet Regime&#8221;</p>
<p>www ihr org/jhr/v14/v14n1p-4_Weber html</p>
<blockquote><p>Although officially Jews have never made up more than five percent of the country&rsquo;s total population, they played a highly disproportionate and probably decisive role in the infant Bolshevik regime, effectively dominating the Soviet government during its early years. The facts cannot be denied.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>With the notable exception of Lenin (Vladimir Ulyanov), most of the leading Communists who took control of Russia in 1917-20 were Jews. Leon Trotsky (Lev Bronstein) headed the Red Army and, for a time, was chief of Soviet foreign affairs. Yakov Sverdlov (Solomon) was both the Bolshevik party&rsquo;s executive secretary and   &mdash;   as chairman of the Central Executive Committee   &mdash;   head of the Soviet government. Grigori Zinoviev (Radomyslsky) headed the Communist International (Comintern), the central agency for spreading revolution in foreign countries. Other prominent Jews included press commissar Karl Radek (Sobelsohn), foreign affairs commissar Maxim Litvinov (Wallach), Lev Kamenev (Rosenfeld) and Moisei Uritsky.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lenin himself was of mostly Russian and Kalmuck ancestry, but he was also one-quarter Jewish.</p></blockquote>
<p>=</p>
<p>Winston Churchill, for one, warned in an article published in the February 8, 1920, issue of the London Illustrated Sunday Herald that Bolshevism is a &#8220;worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality.&#8221; The eminent British political leader and historian went on to write:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistical Jews. It is certainly a very great one; it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are Jews.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Engelman, Winston Churchill was wrong and you are right? Laughable!</p>
<p>According to Solzhenitsyn in The Gulag Archipelago, 66 million Russian Christians were put to death on the orders of the Cheka or Russian secret police. Those devising the tortures, and giving the orders to rape and kill ethnic Russians, were mostly Jews. Yuri Slezkine&rsquo;s candid quote from historian Leonard Shapiro is too well known to be casually dismissed: &ldquo;Anyone who had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Cheka stood a very good chance of finding himself confronted with and possibly shot by a Jewish investigator.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Out of 388 members of the new revolutionary government in Russia, only sixteen were real Russians. &#8216;Apart from one negro,&rsquo; we are told, &#8216;the rest were Jews.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>-Solzhenitsyn </p>
<p>So, Engelman, Solzhenitsyn, who was a first-hand witness to the Revolution and lived through it is WRONG but you are RIGHT?</p>
<p>There is more, the evidence is irrefutable so stop spreading the LIE that Jews weren&rsquo;t responsible for the Russian Revolution and aftermath that slaughtered 66+ million innocent White Christian Russians.</p>
<p>The Russians certainly did NOT do this to themselves, as Solzhenitsyn reported:</p>
<blockquote><p>You must understand. The leading Bolsheviks who took over Russia were not Russians. They hated Russians. They Hated Christians. Driven by ethnic hatred they tortured and slaughtered millions of Russians without a shred of human remorse&hellip;More of my countrymen suffered horrific crimes at their bloodstained hands than any people or nation ever suffered in the entirety of human history. It cannot be overstated. Bolshevism committed the greatest human slaughter of all time. The fact that most of the world is ignorant and uncaring about this enormous crime is proof that the global media is in the hands of its perpetrators.</p></blockquote>
<p>-Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who himself suffered greatly in the Jewish-run Gulags, and who later won the Nobel Prize, stated these powerful words.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons Marxism was appealing to some Jews who lost their religious faith. The Marxian ideal of the classless society after the Revolution resembled what religious Jews hope for after the coming of the Messiah. There will be no war, crime, or poverty. </p>
<p>Moreover, in order to deflect hostility from itself the Czarist government fomented pogroms against Russian Jews. Those pogroms caused many Russian Jews to immigrate to the United States during the turn of the last century. We have benefited from the talent of those Russian Jews. Those pogroms also caused many Russian Jews to join various Russian revolutionary groups, including the Bolsheviks. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Bolshevik Party, and the Soviet Communist Party it evolved into were never primarily Jewish. No dictator of the Soviet Union was a secular Jew. The Soviet government persecuted religious Jews. During the Six Day War of 1967, and the Yom Kipper War of 1973 the Soviet Union supported the Arabs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Minority Rites: Modern Lessons from the Bolshevik Revolution&#8221;</p>
<p> http //www theoccidentalobserver net/2014/07/minority-rites-modern-lessons-from-the-bolshevik-revolution/</p>
<p>Those who promulgated the Russian Revolution that slaughtered millions were themselves victims of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must carry along with us ninety million out of the 100 million of Soviet Russia&rsquo;s inhabitants. As for the rest, we have nothing to say to them. They must be annihilated.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Jewish Commissar, Grigorii Zinoviev</p>
<blockquote><p>Grigorii Zinoviev is described as &ldquo;Lenin&rsquo;s Mad Dog&rdquo; in this fascinating and disturbing book. Zinoviev launched &ldquo;the Red Terror&rdquo; after Uritsky&rsquo;s assassination and Lenin&rsquo;s &ldquo;close call&rdquo; in 1918. Moisei Uritsky was the head in Petrograd of the Cheka, the murderous secret police that later became the OGPU, the NKVD and the KGB. Its first leader was Felix Dzerzhinsky and one of its chief torturers was Yakov Peters. This book describes how Peters &ldquo;interrogated&rdquo; the &ldquo;Socialist Revolutionary&rdquo; Fanya Kaplan, the woman arrested for the attempt on Lenin&rsquo;s life. In response,Yakov Sverdlov promised &ldquo;merciless mass terror against all enemies of the Revolution.&rdquo; Sverdlov was another of Stalin&rsquo;s victims, another of the commissars who vanished.<br/>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s an important pattern in the preceding paragraph. A negative one: although it describes a very important episode in Russian history, it does not contain a single ethnic Russian. Zinoviev, Uritsky, Sverdlov and Kaplan were all Jewish, Stalin was Georgian, Dzerzkinksy was Polish and Peters was Latvian. Lenin was half Mongol, a quarter German and a quarter Jewish. The Bolshevik Revolution is an example of what happens when paranoid, vengeful minorities win power over a majority with whom they do not identify and against whom they have historic grudges. This is exactly what is planned for the White inhabitants of Europe and the United States: they will be ruled by minorities who have been encouraged to hate and scapegoat Whites</p></blockquote>

This is the real reason I debate the hardcore anti-Semite here. I think they are far worse for our movement, our Folk, than all the Eric Holders in the world.</p>

<p>We cannot begin to fight back unless we know WHO is seeking our genocide and WHY. That a genocide is being conducted against the White race is not in question, it IS happening in all and only White countries.</p>
<p>Propaganda and Engelman were rightly banned from Alternative Right for trying to distract, divert, poison and undermine pro-White advocacy.</p>
<p>For example, the post by Engelman above says, &#8220;On several occasions I have pointed out that Jews were always in the minority in the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet Communist Party, and that that no Jews was a dictator of the Soviet Union.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is 100% wrong and has been shown to him on this site and Alternative Right repeatedly with hard facts, data and empirical evidence that has been well-researched over the past decades. </p>
<p>That Jews instigated and led the Bolshevik revolution is not in dispute yet comments like Engelman&rsquo;s are allowed to stand.</p>

<p>For the theme is not really that one of IQ, but the attitude prevalent in liberals and the attitude which they subsequently present to Blacks as reason and rationale for their status, which, in turn, leads them to &#8216;racial hatred&rsquo; against us.</p>
<p>The part about never tiring to rake up history - even though we were not singularly to blame as a race - is clear enough to most of us here, but may well resonate as a valid point to a wider audience. </p>
<p>I refuse to watch certain films, but I suspect that The Butler, 12 Years A Slave, Django Unchained, Planet Of The Apes, Avatar, and many more, are served up to instil perpetual racial hatred against whites and continue the agendas of the liberal left. Didn&rsquo;t some black people in the States tweet after one of these films that it makes them feel like going out and hurting white people?</p>
<p>Not all of the video translates directly to Britain, but the element of fostering hatred to us and ignoring reality in favour of &#8220;emotion&#8221; and &#8220;good intentions&#8221; is universal within white societies.</p>

<p>It is not the first time, and will certainly not be the last. I have not tuned into it, but from the clips being aired to advertise it, I can already tell the tone of it. Ie, how it was all magical and covered in a completely one-sided way.</p>
<p>Not only does it annoy me that the airwaves seem filled with this kind of thing, but that (apologies) the American civil rights issues have nothing to do with Britain anyway and is used as just another tool to foster our &#8220;white guillt&#8221;.</p>

<p>What is certain is that blacks are stupid. There isn&rsquo;t a single IQ test that blacks perform better than whites on, unless you consider the BITCH-100 a legitimate IQ test. People always knew that blacks were stupid. Even the Muslim Arabs who first explored darkest Africa knew that blacks were stupid. In fact, you don&rsquo;t even need to give blacks an IQ test to know that blacks are stupid.

<p>Arthur Shopenhauer, the man in my avatar, thought that whites were superior because of their &#8220;sensitivity.&#8221; I think he was on to something. I won&rsquo;t be surprised if Asians are a bit cleverer than we are, but we have something that produces people like Plato, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. Asians don&rsquo;t have that, whatever it is.</p>

<p>In <i>Group Differences in Intelligence</i> (2000), the psychologist John Loehlin writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is some dispute as to whether Asian Americans obtain higher average scores on IQ tests than European Americans or<br/>
score at about the same level. Richard Lynn has estimated that the IQs of<br/>
Asians in their native countries average around 106 but that those of Asian Americans might be a little lower (Lynn, 1991). In contrast, James Flynn has argued that many studies that have compared the test scores of various Asian-American samples with U.S. norms have involved an artifact, namely, they have failed to allow for the prevailing upward creep of IQ test performance over time (the so-called &ldquo;Flynn effect&rdquo;; Flynn 1984, 1996). <b>When the results from studies using just Asian-American samples were adjusted for this effect and combined with those from studies in which both groups were simultaneously measured on the same tests, Flynn found little overall IQ difference between European and Asian Americans – perhaps a couple of IQ points in favor of European Americans</b> (Flynn, 1991).</p>
<p>[…] </p>
<p>There is also a large difference in how effectively Asian Americans and European Americans convert their cognitive skills into professional and occupational achievement (Weyl, 1969). Flynn estimated that Asian Americans tend to achieve at a level characteristic of European Americans with IQs 10 to 20 points higher. This is partly because a greater proportion of Asian Americans who are qualified for higher education in fact undertake it and partly due to their being able to succeed at lower ability levels by working harder (Flynn, 1991). </p></blockquote>
<p>The Coleman Report (1966) is one of the largest and most representative studies of racial-ethnic differences in IQ and achievement. According to this report, Asian Americans (Chinese and Japanese) have lower IQ&rsquo;s than white Americans. When the report&rsquo;s final scores are converted to an IQ metric, the average scores for the different racial-ethnic groups are as follows: </p>
<p>European Americans: Verbal: <b>102</b> Nonverbal: <b>102</b></p>
<p>African Americans: Verbal: 85.5 Nonverbal: 85.9</p>
<p>Asian Americans: Verbal: <b>98.2</b> Nonverbal: <b>101.5</b></p>
<p>Native Americans: Verbal: 88.9 Nonverbal: 95.0</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-551292" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>But why do Asians in Asian countries score so much higher? I have wondered if it&rsquo;s due to unrepresentative population samples, but I don&rsquo;t know if there is any evidence of that. Other than Flynn&rsquo;s rebellious take on the data, which I&rsquo;ve seen before, most everyone else seems to agree without much debate that Asians have a higher IQ.<br/>
Judging by history, you would expect whites to be a few points ahead of Asians, not the other way around. But I don&rsquo;t want to be the sort of person who refuses to accept facts, either.</p>

The IQ tests and the conclusions drawn from that data are just another example. IT is clear from achievement alone that whites are far smarter than blacks, we do not need IQ test data to know this. The supposed IQ data a bout white verses Asian IQ though conflicts with real world achievement. In that case, either the data is wrong, or the real world is wrong. Academics will say that the real world is wrong, never their data nor their conclusions.</p>

<p>Wherever you look, Asians outperform whites academically and financially&hellip;</p>
<p>we have a considerably less than one standard deviation difference between Asian IQ  &mdash;  North Asian IQ  &mdash;  and white IQ. I think that, too, is a result of genetics, and I think that that is what explains the dominance of Asians in certain fields, and their lower rates of illegitimacy compared to whites, their lower crime rates, their better achievement in school, their higher average incomes&hellip;</p>
<p>I think Asians are objectively superior to whites by just about any measure that you can come up with in terms of what are the ingredients for a successful society.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to discount that but you know what ? Last 2 times i arrived in Italy, i came from Hong Kong International and Incheon airports. Few minutes after i landed i was wondering if i boarded the wrong plane and i ended up in Kurdistan and honestly thinking of Galieo, Da Vinci or Galvani wasn&rsquo;t a great relief.</p>
<p>Modernity must be created continuously, it is not automatically inherited. Now i would never discount the Anglo world but Continental Europe, even the North, didn&rsquo;t have a technological breakthrough in generations.</p>
<p>It gets by producing luxury goods and the same upgraded versions of upper midtier industrial goods. All stuff already suffering from rising Chinese competition.</p>
<p>Aside from a few pockets here and there where are the European companies of the future ? Even from a cultural point of view there&rsquo;s not much going on: the Korean entertainment complex (online services, videogames, tv drama and pop music) revenues vastly exceed the equivalent for the whole Continental Europe landmass. There are more kids in France listening to k-pop, watching anime and buying stickers or Line than Korean or Japanese kids listening to Daft Punk and catching some French movie. </p>
<p>Now if we go back in history, you know who was the true giant of human civilization until about a millennium ago ?</p>
<p>It was the Middle east and no it wasn&rsquo;t white people who created the great civilisations of Sumer, Akkadia, Dyanstic Egypt etc etc. (even ancient Greece) It was the ancestors of the people we call now generically Arabs: people whose y DNA is marked by haplotypes E, G, J etc. that are still commonly found in the area.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden the Mediterranean world disappeared from history, i personally believe islam is to blame as it triggered a devastating disgenic, mind you i&rsquo;m not necessarily talking about miscegenation with the darkies, effect in the areas where it ruled.</p>
<p>So a 10000 years history of intellectual dominance (from the initial mastering of agriculture) came to an abrupt end and you know what ? I don&rsquo;t feel particularly inclined to pay roylaties to Ahmed every time i run a Markov chain Montecarlo simulation because of the achievements of ancient Sumer.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-551314" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Northeast Asians in Asia do not score higher than whites. The research, which is entirely based on the work of Richard Lynn, happens to be seriously methodologically flawed. In <i>The Learning Gap: Why Our Schools are Failing and What We Can Learn from Japanese and Chinese Education</i> (1994), the psychologists H.W Stevenson and J.W. Stigler write:</p>
<blockquote><p>The claim that Japanese students are more intelligent than American students has been made by the Irish psychologist Richard Lynn, whose work was publicized several years ago in the cover story of a national magazine. Using American norms, Lynn computed Japanese children&rsquo;s scores on a commonly used test of intelligence. On this scale, Japanese children&rsquo;s average IQ was significantly above the American average. Lynn&rsquo;s claims, if correct, would add greatly to our understanding of cultural differences in achievement, but as another publication has pointed out, they are wrong. Asian children may learn more during their school years, but their <i>capacity</i> – which is what intelligence tests measure – does not differ from that of American children. </p>
<p>The fundamental flaw in Lynn&rsquo;s report was his failure to<br/>
consider two important variables: location of residence (urban versus rural) and socioeconomic status of the children&rsquo;s families. One of the consistent findings since intelligence tests were devised nearly a century ago has been the large differences between IQ scores of city children and children living in remote villages, and between children from upper-income families and from disadvantaged homes. Lynn did not gather any of his information himself, but instead relied on the norms of the test that were published in the test manual. His choice was unfortunate. Because intelligence tests in Japan are primarily used in large cities, only urban children had been tested to establish the norms. Moreover, no attention had been paid to the necessity of selecting a representative sample of children from each Japanese city. The norms for the American test, by contrast, were based on a truly representative sample of urban and rural children of all socioeconomic levels.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Contrary to what would be expected if cross-cultural differences in general intelligence could explain the striking differences in<br/>
achievement, we found little overall difference in the levels of cognitive functioning of children across the three cultures. American children did not display lower intellectual abilities than Chinese and Japanese children.</p></blockquote>

I&rsquo;m &#8220;suggesting&#8221; that the relevant comparison is not between Asians and Americans taking the same test in American Standard English, nor is it between Asians and Americans taking the same test in the relevant Asian language (e.g., Japanese, Chinese, Korean). It is between Americans and Asians taking a test WHICH IS COMPOSED OF THE SAME QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS, each in his or her own native tongue. Any other way introduces all sorts of &#8220;fluency bias,&#8221; e.g., are the particular Americans taking the test in Korean more fluent in Korean than the particular Koreans taking the test in ASE are fluent in ASE?</p>

For all their accomplishments in STEM courses, and aptitude in math and science in general, one wonders when or if the next Steve Jobs will have Chen or Wong as a surname. Any lover of classical music will find many highly accomplished Asian musicians, but few, if any, as composers or showing an aptitude for jazz and its improvisational elements. It starts at the adolescent level for most Asian countries. I recently read that the last seven winners of the national spelling bee champions were of Indian descent. While that may be a source or pride to the winner and his or her parents, it shows nothing more than a proclivity for rote memorization. Knowing how to spell &#8220;knaidel&#8221; won&rsquo;t get you far in life.<br/>
Finally, if you believe that winning a Nobel prize is a highly distinctive honor, take a glance at a list of any of the winners in science in almost any year. If all it took were a profound knowledge of the subject matter the list would read like the Honk Kong phone book- but it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>In another article i read they mentioned the number of Chinese college graduates in America returning to the PRC should exceed the inflow of new students coming to the US for the first time in 2017, i&rsquo;ll find the link.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a parallel phenomenon: more and more Western companies in China are loosing talent to their Chinese competitors as the latter offer more opportunities in terms of career advancements, stock options bonuses etc.</p>

I do not think that having high IQ mean you will get ahead faster than others. A high IQ just mean you can learn things faster, but persistence is much more important. Intelligence tests are cultural biased, because, I met Indians in the deep Amazon jungle,that I discovered were very intelligent. Why they still live in a hut in a jungle? Because, there they know how to<br/>
survive, they master their own environment, They learn how to hunt and fish, and which plants are useful as medicines or food. They can name most insects, animals, difference between trees and vegetation, some of these people know more about<br/>
their rainforests than scientists specialized in rainforests for!<br/>
However, I understand that you are interested in helping people to achieve more and that is wonderful. I think, it is very important to give a baby a book (cloth book) as soon as he/she can hold it. It<br/>
is also very important to talk to children much less about money, and more about &ldquo;interesting things&rdquo;. To give a child<br/>
a subscription to some of the following magazines, like National Geographic for children, Scientific American Mind magazine, Cricket Magazine, Detective Science, Active Kids Magazine. Children should visit Museums more often than Disneyland. Children should go at least once per week, to a Library and a Bookstores, instead of the Shopping Cter. The more mental stimulation a child gets around the age of four, the more developed the parts of their brains dedicated to language<br/>
and cognition will be in the decades ahead. Even is a parent is not educated enough, he/she can read books, and share his newly acquired knowledge with their children in a simple language, for example &ldquo;Books are full of secrets, do you know that ……. Most galaxies in the universe are……… A child will start developing scientific curiosity. My best wishes</p>

I would like to offer just one minor criticism: Mr. Taylor talks about how even most blacks want honest discussions on race. This may or may not be true. But that is beside the point. Our race realist positions are right because they are right. We have the facts on our side. We are not right because some blacks might agree or respect them. I don&rsquo;t know if Mr. Taylor made this video this way because he shrewdly didn&rsquo;t want to scare some White fence sitters away from race realism; that is a possibility. But, I do think that we as White people have to get away from the habit of seeking vindication from blacks, who history has shown, are not exactly the wisest or most virtuous race of people in the world. That&rsquo;s all, thanks.</p>

<p>The tests I&rsquo;ve seen and taken can be gamed. I believe many Asians seemingly have higher IQs because of the nerd factor and that if Whites were as motivated in studies they&rsquo;d come out on top for the highest average IQ. One proviso here, Whites are very varied in all of our characteristics, so a White population would have to be properly constituted to give a an accurate &#8220;average score&#8221; for Whites as a whole.</p>

It is so painfully obvious in the Middle East. Israel plays it like a fiddle. While all groups of religious nut heads squabble with each other, the Jews grab everything, oil, gold, treasure, the works. The U.S.government is thoroughly bribed and has been since Truman. The plan is to move on to Russia once the petrodollar is finished, an event coming much quicker than the original 2016 forecast.</p>

They were the SOLE group who fought for decades to change the immigration laws of this country and they achieved that in the sixties. They controlled the media and public debate for decades. They made once common sentiments and beliefs about the races something that people are destroyed for now if the utter them. Now, are country is on the very brink, we have day after day of whites being killed by blacks and browns, we have borders overrun and we have Americans now being attacked for protesting illegal alien dumping.

I&rsquo;ve been very nice to you, little boy, offered the other cheek, olive branches, openings to dialogue, and you&rsquo;ve been pretty slimy in your responses. So what?

Thank God, Gog, and Magog for the internet, eh?<br/>
If Mr. MacDonald would admit to the self willed culpability in White Genocide of MILLIONS of intelligent, well educated non-Jewish Whites, I&rsquo;d be much more amenable to his points.<br/>
What never gets unstuck from my craw, however, is the godlike utter and complete culpability of these &#8220;alien reptiloid&#8221; type 30 to 40 million people worldwide, combined with the mewling, whining, external-locus-of-control complete eschewing of personal culpability and responsibility for unpleasant realities.<br/>

Have you heard of &#8220;Biorock&#8221; created by mineral accretion? It requires a weak electric charge run through metals. A metal framework in the ocean can be turned into a rock structure in a rather short period of time. The framework could contain floatation cells. They could make the framework in the shape of a hexagon and then continually add new hexagons on top or on bottom, building down into the ocean, creating a tower. They could have more buoyancy chambers inside the tower to raise it up out of the water during big storms. Unlike concrete, this system could heal itself when damaged, just run the current again and the cracks will fill in, and it would grow instead of being degraded by the ocean over time.Several hexagonal towers could be put together to make an ever increasing structure. One could start out small and grow the structure. IT would be great if we could relocate them to an &#8220;ocean nation&#8221; where they would be free from the negro at last. Perhaps they could keep the western part of SA and SWA.</p>

Blacks may have been less violent in the past, that point in the past when those graphs started, but that was because they had been beaten back down after they had run rampant during reconstruction. Run those graphs back to the period after the civil war and it would become symmetric. There would have been a high level of black violence and lawlessness, then the level would have decreased after they and been constrained by whites. .They were beaten down and a necessary constraint was placed on them and &#8220;jim crow&#8221; was a manifestation of that constraint.</p>

It&rsquo;s not Jim Crow that was effective. It was the fact that, were a white person to shoot dead a negro, it was universally assumed to be self-defense and no big deal. It was unheard of for police, let alone courts, to do anything except haul the dead criminal away.<br/>
Often, black violence was responded to as a group. A black person who raped a white woman would spark a riot with many blacks shot dead before whites were satisfied.</p>

<p>The Great Society rapidly changed the dominant profile of the black underclass. They breed twice as fast as whites, and our experiment selected for pathologies.</p>
<p>The black population in America has bifurcated. We have some blacks that can live among us, the &#8216;black middle class&rsquo; -the affirmative action beneficiaries. Their well being would be enhanced by a public acknowledgement of racial differences. They are the folks Mr. Taylor met at Temple. </p>
<p>Then you have the legions of misfits. The people incapable of learning to read or understanding cause and effect (&#8220;My baby may a hold a gun at the pohleese but they didn&rsquo;t gotta kill him like that&#8221;). The black men in mugshots with dead eyes. No social control can make this a manageable population at this point. We need to cut our losses, withdraw support, and let nature take its course.</p>

<p>Blacks were kept rightfully separated from Whites for decades before Brown v. Board of Ed and other anti-White &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; laws were passed to force blacks into our children&rsquo;s schools, neighborhoods, on public transportation and in places of business.</p>
<p>It was never about helping blacks; it was and is about destroying Whites.</p>
<p>These laws were specifically designed to unleash blacks upon Whites in order to destroy White Western Civilization. The 1965 Immigration flood act that favored non-Whites was the second of the one-two punch. These was no reason on earth to open America&rsquo;s borders to the 3rd world, the results of which have been disastrous for the Native Born White Population.</p>
<p>These are part of a long-term, coldly calculated and planned out agenda to destroy White countries.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-551279" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Black-on&rsquo;white violence has nothing to do with black &#8216;hatred&rsquo; of whites. It has everything to do with black CONTEMPT for whites as slow, flabby &#8216;white boys&rsquo;. Blacks are naturally stronger, tougher, faster, and more aggressive than whites. Blacks are obsessed with muscle power, thuggery, and violence. Evolution in hot and wild Africa favored the warrior gene. So, when blacks see white guys, they feel contempt for the wussy white boy. Blacks see white boys as easy bully-bait. </p>
<p>But then, blacks do the same to Hispanics and Asians even though the media(run by Jews) don&rsquo;t teach blacks to hate browns and yellows. Blacks bully and attack all races because they just love to feel the power. </p>
<p>Taylor talks of IQ differences but far more significant are physical differences. Blacks are tougher than whites and despise wussy white boys. If blacks were scrawny and weak, no amount of anti-white propaganda taught to them could make them attack whites since whites would kick black ass. Imagine if your average black guy was like Gary Coleman. The problem is too many are built like Muhammad Ali and Jack Johnson and Earl Campbell. </p>
<p>Also, there is a sexual element to this. Women evolved to prefer the alpha male. So, as white women see blacks whup white ass, more will run after Negro studs, esp as porn-available even to young white girls-celebrate the BIG black guy plowing white girls and since white girls shake their booty to rap music where black guys holler about conquering all the white girls away from dorky white dweeb losers. </p>
<p>IQ differences are not the main problem. It&rsquo;s physical differences. Blacks kick white butt and white girls are turned on tough white guys and lose respect for slow white guys.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-551440" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Here&rsquo;s the reality:</p>
<p>1. Most Blacks lack impulse control and can&rsquo;t think through the consequences of their actions. So, they quickly attack Whites. Whites on the other hand do have impulse control and do think through the consequences of their actions and engage in ritual combat more than actual combat. That is, Whites are prone to yell and call names while Blacks are prone to just attack.</p>
<p>2. Blacks are better at some sports because of chicken legs. Big thighs and butts and skinny lower legs. Kick their shins and you can easily break them, but kicking shins isn&rsquo;t part of, say, regular boxing. Most Blacks in prize fights will win because of the chicken legs, not because of arm muscle strength-although it appears this way to the casual viewer.</p>
<p>3. Blacks have stronger chins and don&rsquo;t fall so quickly if hit with right crosses to the point of the chin. However, they are weak in the neck area just below the ears and blows to those areas, such as with left and right hooks will often knock them out. In fact they are so weak in those areas that most police departments now keep cops from using sleeper holds because Blacks often die from them, while they don&rsquo;t hurt Whites.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Whites need to fight the genes, not the man.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the reality of innate racial differences has legitimate public policy implications. Ignoring those implications has lead to failed government programs, and the widespread assumption that the government cannot do anything right. </p>
<p>In 1958 73 percent of Americans trusted the government to do the right thing most or all of the time. That rose until 1964. In 1964 the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed. The War on Poverty was begun. What also begun was five years of black ghetto rioting. The crime rate doubled from 1960 to 1970. In 2013 only 19 percent of Americans trusted the government to do the right thing most or all of the time.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-551593" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;As someone who is half Black&#8221;  &mdash;  (I place this in quotes because the statement, while cliché, and overly used, for whatever reason lends &#8220;credibility&#8221; to my comments below; it shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip; but it does)  &mdash;   this video can be summed up in one sentence:<br/>
&#8220;Blacks need to have the virtue of humility, whereby they acknowledge the truth about themselves individually, and collectively, as a people.&#8221;<br/>
No purpose is served in trying to state that Blacks, taken collectively, are as smart as Whites in every area. Nor do we need (through taxation of Whites, of course) to fund tests or research to establish these truths. That would be both pointless and absurd. One need do no more than look at the world around them and draw what is obvious to one&rsquo;s own very eyes.<br/>
There is no dishonor in Blacks having jobs which are considered &#8220;lower&#8221; in nature, provided one is both honest and industrious in their duties. Telling someone  &mdash;  anyone, White or Black  &mdash;  that they can do &#8220;whatever they set their minds to&#8221; is both disingenuous and wrong. It sets one up for inevitable failure besides, and the concomitant frustration that comes with the inability of successfully fulfilling one&rsquo;s obligations.<br/>
Furthermore, in the many, many videos that I have seen wherein Jared Taylor debates someone, or is a featured speaker, never once have I witnessed  &mdash;  even remotely, or tacitly, a sentiment which might be described as evocative of &#8220;racial hatred&#8221; or &#8220;racism&#8221;. If given the opportunity, I&rsquo;d publically defend Mr. Taylor on this  &mdash;  and gladly so. I simply don&rsquo;t see him as &#8220;racist&#8221; at all  &mdash;  -but even if he were  &mdash;  he&rsquo;d still every right to his views; nor should he be in anyway penalized for this. Last time I checked, this is still the United States (Keep me updated on our national status; this is changing by the hour!)<br/>
Along the same lines, in video debates that I have seen  &mdash;  I have in mind one in particular that he had with a racist Hispanic professor(?)  &mdash;  I have seen Mr. Taylor conduct himself with class, sophistication  &mdash;  and, above all, logic. Whereas, I found the other side glib, evasive of facts, illogical, incendiary, and entirely emotive, to say nothing of being rather pedestrian and childlike.<br/>
My judgment on Mr. Taylor: He&rsquo;s almost like a living saint. A very honorable and decent man, indeed. You can just look at him and tell.</p>

I am pro-me-and-mine, not inherently anti-other. If an other, however, is anti-me-and-mine, I am fiercely and unapologetically anti-other.<br/>
That said I respect honestly and intelligence and decency, and probably &#8220;get along with&#8221; blacks better than anyone else here in person, being a well trained sociopathic chameleon, an evil White southern man and a former Democrat.<br/>
Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s decency and dignity have been an inspiration and sterling model for me and for many others.<br/>
I call my conversion from liblefty-ism my &#8220;dark enlightenment&#8221; and it has not been pleasant.<br/>
But it&rsquo;s better than worshipping a big Lie, you know?<br/>
Thanks for your post. You&rsquo;re not Obama, are you, lol?</p>

Look up the definition of the word and you&rsquo;ll see that hate is not the definition of racist. It simply means that one prefers one race over another, which is only normal. Whites need to get over caring about being called racist. As Americans we all SHOULD have the freedom of association. Only whites do not have that freedom; we&rsquo;re forced at gunpoint by the US government to work, go to school with, and live with those the government commands that we associate with. If whites prefer to be with other whites instead of other races, they&rsquo;re considered evil, mean, &amp; hateful. Only whites, though. Other races are free to do as they please.</p>

Allow me to frame the matter generally: Incentive directs action towards reward (and away from punishment).

<p>One can hardly blame individual members of a so-called &#8220;aggrieved&#8221; group when rewards are dangled in front of them. It&rsquo;s like being on the payroll of a grievance regime   &mdash;   and they are going to PAY me for believing their militant B.S.? And the greater my belief in the B.S., the more I get paid? Sign me up.</p>

You have trouble understanding this because such a thing is so alien to your nature. Blacks are evil. They literally choose to do extremely evil things even when their own survival is at stake. Haiti&hellip;.great example. A natural catastrophe hit them. Virtually NONE of them banded together to help each other.

I understand that MRI scans have revealed that Oriental brains are slightly larger than white brains, with more neurones. Orientals also do all those things we associate with having a high IQ. So why would anyone think that whites have the same IQ?</i></p>
<p>There is a weak to moderate positive correlation between brain size and IQ, so it&rsquo;s obvious that brain size isn&rsquo;t the sole determinant of intelligence. For example, men have larger brains than women, but the general consensus is that there are no sex difference in IQ. In addition, the Inuit and indigenous Siberian peoples have the largest, heaviest brains on the planet, but have significantly lower IQ&rsquo;s than whites.</p>
<p>If IQ accurately predicts real world achievement and whites have achieved far more than Northeast Asians, it logically follows that whites have higher IQ&rsquo;s than Northeast Asians.</p>

They have a work ethic, values, an education. Remember biology works on a bell curve and there are exceptional people in every group, just as there are failures and dimwits in each group. But those blacks who make it into an upper middle class community will be exceptional. This skews the opinion of many whites. Few people in many neighborhoods ever meet the urban black, and there are many, many more of those than the urbane ones in the suburbs. Political correctness and a very selective experience both skews the world views of so many white folk to the detriment of white folk.<br/>

I recognise that other White men are smarter, richer, stronger, more athletic&hellip;etc&hellip; That knowledge does not justify deviant behaviour based on jealousy and resentment. Black justification comes from a general &#8216;genetic&rsquo; lack of intelligence and liberal permissiveness and misplaced White guilt. Period.</p>
