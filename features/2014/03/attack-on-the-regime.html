<p>&ldquo;Human evolution has been recent, copious, and regional.&rdquo; With these heroic words, <i>New York Times </i>science writer Nicholas Wade opens fire on two of the obligatory myths of our time: that there is no such thing as race, and that human evolution stopped in the Stone Age.</p>
<p>It is gratifying to see someone firmly planted in the mainstream poke the regime in the eye, and the regime&rsquo;s reaction will be a diverting spectacle. Bravo Mr. Wade, and we wish him a thick skin &mdash; though we wish he had not been quite so circumspect on certain matters.</p>
<p><strong> Race is real</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Wade notes that the early peddlers of race-is-a-myth, such as Ashley Montagu (the stylish name British-born Israel Ehrenberg chose for himself), were clearly trying to distort science for political purposes, and that more recent peddlers, such as Jared Diamond and Steven Jay Gould have done the same thing.</p>
<p>The physical differences we see in human groups reflect separate evolutionary paths that led to unmistakably biological differences. Hunter-gatherers left Africa about 50,000 years ago, and once they wandered into all of earth&rsquo;s habitable spaces, they stayed put and bred with their neighbors. DNA testing shows there was essentially no crossing until the modern era. For tens of thousands of years, independently breeding populations developed distinct genetic patterns.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade explains that the physical traits of populations are dramatically and consistently different even though there are very few alleles, or gene variants, that occur exclusively in only one group. This is because most traits are influenced by many genes. Norwegians, for example, need have only a <i>preponderance</i> of Norwegian-style alleles in their genes in order to give birth exclusively to Norwegians &mdash; and never to Malays or Pakistanis. As Mr. Wade puts it, &ldquo;The fact that genes work in combination explains how there can be so much variation in the human population and yet so few fixed differences between populations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wade also spends a few pages batting down some of the other side&rsquo;s silly arguments. He patiently explains that, yes, there are mixed-race people but they do not disprove race. There can be mixed-race people only because there are races. He also explains that disagreement about the number of races does not disprove their existence either. Different people just draw lines at different places.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Mr. Wade points out that &ldquo;brain genes do not lie in some special category exempt from natural selection. They are as much under evolutionary pressure as any other category of gene.&rdquo; And since human evolution is &ldquo;recent and copious,&rdquo; the brains of different populations function differently. This is the book&rsquo;s main heresy: After the races separated, they evolved different mental patterns that gave rise to different social patterns.</p>
<p><strong> Social behavior evolved</strong></p>
<p>The idea that human races have been evolving right up until the present is not new. <a href="/ar/2009/05/index.html#article1"><i>The 10,000 Year Explosion</i></a>, written in 2009 by Henry Harpending and Gregory Cochran, is the best introduction to this subject, and explains why evolution has been roaring along 100 times faster during that last several thousand years than it did during the Stone Age.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade goes over some of the same ground, pointing out how dramatic a change it was for our ancestors to switch from nomadic hunting to settled agriculture. For the first time, something more than bare subsistence became possible. This led to trade, wealth and poverty, government, taxes, con men, priests, etc. &mdash; an evolutionary environment completely different from the African savannah. As Mr. Wade notes, new circumstances produced new people:</p>
<blockquote><p>As soon as the mode of subsistence changes, a society will develop new institutions to exploit its environment more effectively. The individuals whose social behavior is better attuned to such institutions will prosper and leave more children.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some old habits were no longer useful. Farmers had to think ahead and save seed corn, whereas hunters immediately gorged themselves on kills that would rot in a few days. Smash-and-grab made sense for fast-moving nomads but not for city-dwellers who had to live with neighbors. As a rule, the longer a population has been farmers, the more the hunter has been bred out of it. The last 10,000 years has therefore seen the domestication of what had been the equivalent of a wild animal.</p>
<p>Not all groups are equally domesticated. Tribes that have been nomads into modern times do not adapt well to settled life. The Kalahari Bushmen think of animals only as game, not as livestock, so if someone gives them goats to tend, they eat them. Australian aborigines have not adapted well, either.</p>
<div id="attachment_108155" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/KalahariBushmen.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-108155" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/KalahariBushmen.jpg" alt="Kalahari Bushmen" width="550" height="413"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kalahari Bushmen</p></div>
<p>The Yanomano of the Amazon are notoriously violent, not just against outsiders but among themselves. According to one anthropologist, Yanomamo men who have killed someone in battle have 2.5 more children than those who have not. The means the Yamomano are evolving towards more violence, not less.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade emphasizes that behavior of this kind is influenced by genes, although only a few alleles that affect social behavior have been found. One is MAO-A, the &ldquo;warrior gene,&rdquo; variants of which are clearly associated with a hair-trigger temper and violence. Maoris, for example, are warlike and crime prone &mdash; and they have a high incidence of this variant.</p>
<p>This, in fact, is Mr. Wade&rsquo;s boldest assertion: that different races behave differently because they are genetically different and genetic differences give rise to differences in social institutions. He is at pains to argue that the genetic differences are small &mdash; so small that they are almost undetectable at the individual level &mdash; but that once a group has been nudged even slightly in a particular genetic direction it may be receptive to institutions that completely change the nature of society.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade cites one study that estimates fully 14 percent of the human genome has been under evolutionary pressure since the races separated, and that substantial differences are therefore inevitable. DNA studies show that Tibetans split off from Han Chinese only 3,000 years ago, so it must be only since then that Sherpas evolved their ability to function so well at high altitudes. Indeed, there are more than 30 lung- and circulation-related gene variants that are more common in Tibetans than in Chinese. Mr. Wade also notes that American blacks may already be less likely than Africans to have sickle cell anemia &mdash; because they live on a continent without malaria where there are no benefits to sickle cell alleles. Evolution is constant.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade makes the crucial point that what is known as &ldquo;national character&rdquo; is undoubtedly genetic, and that is why group behavior is consistent. Jews prosper everywhere they go. So do overseas Chinese. If the Malays and Indonesians envy the success of their Chinese minorities, why don&rsquo;t they just copy their good habits? Mr. Wade argues that they can&rsquo;t; they don&rsquo;t have the genetic predisposition to act Chinese.</p>
<p>Africans likewise cannot maintain government institutions. Their colonial masters wrote nifty constitutions for them, showed them how elections work, and explained the importance of an independent judiciary. That all ended up in the ditch once Africans took over.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Gene3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108152" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Gene3.jpg" alt="Gene3" width="550" height="310"/></a></p>
<p>Mr. Wade repeatedly emphasizes the importance of public trust &mdash; the ability to deal fairly with people who are not kin or fellow tribesmen. If a race has not evolved this level of trust it will not get beyond tribalism. That is why Americans can&rsquo;t get Iraqis or Afghans to behave like good democrats no matter how many of them we shoot. Middle Easterners don&rsquo;t have the genetic capacity for republican government, so it is just as crazy to try to force our ways on them as it would be to try to turn Americans into tribalistic, cousin-marrying Afghans.</p>
<p><strong>Europe</strong></p>
<p>One of Mr. Wade&rsquo;s lesser breaches of good manners is to note that Europe made crucial breakthroughs in civilization that many groups have yet to adopt: &ldquo;Europeans, probably for reasons of both evolution and history, have been able to create open and innovative societies, starkly different from the default human arrangements of tribalism or autocracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Academics have long chased their tails trying to explain why some countries are rich and others poor. Mr. Wade points out that their fatal blunder is to assume that all populations are interchangeable. He uses findings by the economic historian Gregory Clark to suggest that in Britain, where records go back far enough to make such studies possible, there was steady evolution towards the qualities crucial to the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>According to Professor Clark, who teaches at UC Davis, from 1200 to 1800, the British became less violent, more literate, more inclined to save, and more reliable workers. Prof. Clark&rsquo;s ingenious studies also show that the rich, who were more likely to have these useful traits, had more children than the poor, many of whom were erased from the gene pool. This naturally occurring eugenics program laid the foundation for the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BritishEmpire.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108148" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BritishEmpire.jpg" alt="BritishEmpire" width="600" height="446"/></a></p>
<p>Mr. Wade points out that most European populations had been evolving similarly, so were quickly able to industrialize as well. So, it turned out, were East Asians, with the Japanese first, followed by Koreans and Chinese.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade argues that science and industry did not first arise in China partly because of millennia of conformist pressure. Chinese were relatively meritocratic, with the Mandarinate open to anyone, but the examinations mainly tested rote memorization. Mr. Wade points also out that Chinese rulers showed an utterly un-European lack of interest in science and exploration, and argues that this reflected long-bred traits of conformity and submission to authority. Even today, Chinese have been unable to adopt one of the cornerstones of Western Civilization: the rule of law. Communists, just like emperors, routinely violate laws they force on others.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade concludes with this heresy:</p>
<blockquote><p>It seems a fortunate outcome that the world&rsquo;s dominant military power has turned out to be the West, with a system of international trade and law that offers benefits to all participants, and not a purely predatory and militaristic state like that of the Mongols or Ottomans, as might have been expected, or even a civilized but autocratic one like that of China.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Timidity</strong></p>
<p>This is all very fine, even courageous stuff. Any assault on dogma is welcome and laudable, and Mr. Wade will certainly take a beating for it. However, there is much waffling in this book, which was no doubt meant to ward off beatings but that, at least to undeceived readers, rings of timidity.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade has a whole chapter on the evils done in the name of race and genetics. We learn that the Comte de Gobineau, Herbert Spencer, and Madison Grant were rotten people, and that even the genius Francis Galton led us down &ldquo;a dangerous path, to the proposal that human populations could be improved by controlling breeding, just like those of domestic animals.&rdquo; There is also the obligatory salaam to the memory of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>None of this belongs in a book about science. It is a clearly an attempt to demonstrate virtue and avoid beatings, but it won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Wade&rsquo;s angle of attack &mdash; social behavior &mdash; is a curious one. It is undoubtedly true that genes influence time preference, radius of trust, lack of aggression, and all the other qualities that make civilization possible, but these characteristics are not well studied and we don&rsquo;t know much about the relevant genes.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade almost completely ignores the psychological trait that has been studied the most: intelligence. He goes into details about the codons and base triplets that result in interesting but peripheral racial differences in hair texture, ear wax consistency, and type of sweat glands, but completely ignores the genetics of intelligence. He even writes that no genes for intelligence have been found, but that is not true. In 2005, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/08/science/08cnd-brain.html?ex=1283832000&amp;en=631902c8dabfb269&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">Mr. Wade himself</a> wrote about the discovery of genes that are implicated in brain development, and researchers recently <a href="/news/2014/02/scientists-identify-gene-linking-brain-structure-to-intelligence.html">isolated a gene</a> that appears to account for 0.5 percent of human variation in intelligence.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade includes a chapter on the superior intelligence of Jews &mdash; this is something people can write about without losing their jobs &mdash; but skips over the question of black intelligence. He has a very superficial account of the debate over the genetic contribution to black-white IQ differences, but then scuttles off to safer territory: &ldquo;That issue needn&rsquo;t be resolved here.&rdquo; Does he really think he can write that Africa is stuck with tribalism for genetic reasons, but avoid a spanking because he refuses to commit himself on IQ?</p>
<p>Mr. Wade&rsquo;s discussion of the MAO-A gene is even more contortionist. He concedes that American blacks are no less than 50 times more likely than whites to carry the variant most closely tied to violence, but says we must draw no conclusions. Why? Whites might have different, <i>as yet undiscovered</i>, alleles that would make them just as violent as blacks.</p>
<p>In his discussion of the evolution of racial differences, Mr. Wade notes that light skin may have spread rapidly through northern populations, in part because it was considered sexually attractive. But he can&rsquo;t bear to stop there and risk leaving the wrong impression. Without one word about the millions of dollars Asians and Africans spend on skin lighteners or about the clear preference even of American blacks &mdash; the widespread preference for light skin &mdash; he suggests that tanning salons prove that dark skin is inherently more attractive.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade also assures us that whites will keep their scientific and creative lead over the Chinese for &ldquo;many generations, barring some major setback.&rdquo; This is because we are genetically less conformist and more open to new ideas. And yet there is no mental plague in China that even approaches the conformity and closed-mindedness Mr. Wade is trying to combat with this book. The ease with which our rulers have driven common sense about race, sex, and nation underground shows how cowardly and conformist the heirs to the Industrial Revolution have become. If the Chinese succeed in widespread embryo selection &mdash; an openly eugenic practice that terrifies Westerners &mdash; they will outstrip us in <i>one</i> generation. Meanwhile, the West is filling up with the very people Mr. Wade tells us are genetically limited &mdash; Amerindians and Middle Easterners &mdash; while China remains resolutely Chinese.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/China.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108149" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/China.jpg" alt="China" width="550" height="310"/></a></p>
<p><strong> Whistling past the graveyard</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Wade writes that his book is an attempt &ldquo;to dispel the fear of racism that overhangs discussion of human group differences and to begin to explore the far reaching implications of the discovery that human evolution has been recent, copious and regional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not possible. If human differences have &ldquo;far reaching implications&rdquo; there is no way to &ldquo;dispel the fear&rdquo; of what goes by the name of &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; What, to begin with, are these far reaching implications? Mr. Wade himself manages to propose exactly one: that foreign aid is probably wasted because poor countries are not genetically prepared for the institutions necessary for wealth.</p>
<p>Mr. Wade even criticizes Steven Pinker of Harvard for thinking about implications. Mr. Wade accuses him of dishonestly running away from the idea of race differences because, in Professor Pinker&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;it could have the incendiary implication that aboriginal and immigrant populations are less biologically adapted to the demands of modern life than populations that have lived in literate societies for millennia.&rdquo; That is exactly what Mr. Wade implies &mdash; but does not say.</p>
<p>The liberal façade is all of a piece. It cannot be punctured only in a few safe and convenient spots. That is why its guardians plug every chink with such bloodthirsty zeal. To accept what dissidents call human biodiversity would open the door to everything the regime most piously hates: immigration control, inequality, self-segregation, nationalism, mono-culturalism. Whether he knows it or not, and no matter how hard he denies it, Mr. Wade has lit a match to the entire liberal/modern world view. The next thing you know, someone might say the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should be repealed or that women have no business on submarines.</p>
<p>That is why the reaction to this book, which goes on sale on May 6, will be so interesting. Lefties will not be placated by the back-cover assertion that &ldquo;Wade believes deeply in the fundamental equality of all human peoples.&rdquo; They will realize that a very respectable figure is blowing a raspberry at their religion.</p>
<p>The smartest thing they could do is ignore <i>A Troublesome Inheritance</i>. The next-smartest thing would be to have truckling scientists calmly &ldquo;refute&rdquo; it by peeing on it from a very great height. Raging about &ldquo;racism&rdquo; would be stupid, and prove only that lefties are believers rather than thinkers.</p>
<p>Alas, it may make no difference what they do. As I wrote <a href="/">20 years ago</a> about a book that goaded the stooges into a record-breaking rage, &ldquo;Unfortunately, the United States is probably capable of weathering a 90-day lather over <i>The Bell Curve</i> that leaves the country exactly as it was before.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tank.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108156" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tank.jpg" alt="Tank" width="450" height="410"/></a></p>
<p>No one knows when sanity will return. Can this book break the logjam? Probably not. But all praise to Nicholas Wade and his publisher, Penguin Press, for trying.</p>

The problem is that if you don&rsquo;t go gently, the true believers will dismiss you, and the power mongers will tar and feather you. If you can produce something that stays at least parallel to the party line, you have a better chance of moving some people a little closer to rational. Most conversions to reality are gradual, and there really does need to be gentle nudges for a great many people. The indoctrination of lies has been gradual. If someone told my grandfather in 1950 that he needs to embrace affirmative action, gay marriage rights, an unqualified black leader gutting the economy and military while openly professing socialist ideals etc&hellip; He would have simply rejected it and scoffed. Gradual. It&rsquo;s frustrating for those of us who can see, but if the day comes that we will all have to go big, every lemming we can peel from the herd will be needed. </p>
<p>But yes, the fact that one must tread this lightly is infuriating   </p>

Within a homogeneous eco-system of a specific culture, compassion and high-trust values are very adaptive.  When perpetual altruists live among freeloaders (low-trust, high-context), it becomes maladaptive.<br/>
The Japanese appear to understand this, while the Scandinavians do not.</p>

<p>Too radical for almost everyone, but probably true. Another spin on it is rebooting history, and seeing how it plays out. Some say history has rebooted once or more than once already. Inevitably, it will reboot again. Just a question of whether it is slow or fast and whether in the near future or the far.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s probably an exaggeration, but not far away from the truth . China has bigger issues besides technological backwardness, including their catastrophic demographic situation (there are places in China where<b> the birth rate is less than a third of the replacement rate </b>, and that is catastrophic in the long term, no matter how smart you are), but with time, the yellow race will overtake us if we don&rsquo;t wake up soon .</p>

<p>I was agreeing with him. In addition, my observations refute the &#8220;city mouse/country mouse&#8221; idea that is rampant, probably throughout the world, that urban folks are somehow &#8220;smarter&#8221; than rural folks.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-469806" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Here&rsquo;s the problem I notice: So many of these discussions on Amren devolve into Jewspiracy nonsense.<br/>
Among the weird people of the Internet, I have read the following stated: Jews started WWII, the Bolshevik revolution was a Jewish revolution, Jews started the French revolution, the American revolution, they &#8220;own&#8221; the Federal Reserve, Christianity is a Jewish plot, and (my favorite) whoever disagrees or refutes any of it is a Jew themselves&hellip; The list goes on.</p>
<p>And people are surprised that racialism isn&rsquo;t taken more seriously when in nearly every respectable article by Jared Taylor, the comments section reflects a weird basement-dwelling people that belong to this absolutely kooky demographic. If I didn&rsquo;t know any better, I would suspect that a certain number of the anti-Jewish agitators here are actually anti-racists that try to hamper racialism.</p>
<p>For the record, and risking the possibility that I will be labeled a &#8216;rabbi&rsquo; by a bunch of Internet thugs, I would like to point out that many of the above Western inventions were Jewish inventions. Cellular technology was invented by Israelis, satellites/GPS/etc. use not only Einstein&rsquo;s understanding of gravity in order to operate but they use technology developed by various Jewish technicians. Communications satellites were invented by Harold Rosen. Jews have discovered many elements to add to that periodic table. William Rankine invented sonar and radar.</p>
<p>Airplanes? Airplanes were not invented by Jews, but David Schwarz<br/>
(1852-1897) is the pioneer of aviation. He is responsible for flying machines, such as the Zeppelin, from years before the Wright brothers had success at Kitty Hawk. </p>
<p>Phones? It&rsquo;s worth looking into one of the most prolific American inventors in history: Jerome H. Lemelson. His inventions made possible the cordless phone, walkmans, camcorders, VHS, and industrial robots.</p>
<p>Computers? Michael Rabin invented magnetic disk memory, along with many other things (like optical character recognition). Jacob Ziv, an Israeli electrical engineer, is responsible for data compression and the algorithms associated with that. Are you ever impressed by small devices holding vast amounts of information, and the fact that computers aren&rsquo;t the size of buildings anymore? Thank Ziv.<br/>
But speaking of the early, giant computers, Max Newman designed the first one, called &#8216;Colossus.&rsquo; John von Neumann, another Jew, is responsible for the architecture and basic structure of the modern computer. The subject of computers is a difficult thing to address in a single comment, because Jews-more than any other group-are responsible for them. So it&rsquo;s quite ironic that it is now one of today&rsquo;s more popular means of creating anti-Jewish kooks. But I&rsquo;ll move on&hellip;</p>
<p>Instant messaging wasn&rsquo;t invented by AOL, they merely secured rights to it. It was invented by Israeli company Mirabilis in 1996. As far as computers go, Jews remain on the cutting edge of science, such as Lumio (an Israeli corporation) creating laser keyboards and such. And Waze (Israeli) creating GPS-route systems, which were purchased by Google in 2008. And quantum computing by Benioff, Feynman, and Deutsch.</p>
<p>To be as marginal as some of the commentators here are, and to be as reductionist in their view of (&#8220;all&#8221;) Jews-of which mainly a loud minority are subversive- you have to live in something of a black hole (black hole entropy being something that was, interestingly, formulated by Jacob Bekenstein).</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t blame the Jews when you find that kookiness marginalizes you from normal White America, who would otherwise be sympathetic to the positions on blacks, or be more likely to oppose race-mixing than hate Jews.<br/>
To give you an idea of how marginalizing it is&hellip; David Duke ran in politics on a platform of denying all his &#8216;Zionist&rsquo; conspiracies and Jew hatred, and said that was something of his silly past-and that is how he won the majority of the Southern White vote. Because Southern Whites were sympathetic to his views, save the kooky Jewspiracy ones. Today, Duke is back to his old, corrupt and perverse, shenanigans and will never again be able to win in an election.<br/>
But for the rest of us &#8216;normal&rsquo; racialists out there, what he had to do to win the election should tell us something about the non-mentally disturbed, God-fearing, charity giving, and good intelligent and creative White people out there that are responsible for this great nation-people who aren&rsquo;t going on Jewish computers every day to complain about how Jews are terrible and made them sit through &#8220;Schindler&rsquo;s List,&#8221; or whatever unimportant problem these fringers seem to have.</p>

<p>That said, without knowing very much about the particulars, I&rsquo;ve always felt that banishment was an unduly harsh punishment.  So some Jew ripped off some peasant on a liquor deal - that really requires kicking out the entire bunch?  It&rsquo;s not as if banishment was predicated on the Jewish presence being a dire threat to racial integrity; people didn&rsquo;t really think in such terms back then.  So it was more than a bit harsh is my impression.</p>

If any group was going to evidence a zeitgeist of mindless hate, it would be for the Japanese. They look different, and they killed a lot of our fathers. Yet even among elderly vets I&rsquo;ve met that isn&rsquo;t the case.<br/>
That fact alone demonstrates that racially based condemnations here are usually rooted in a cause not irrationality.</p>

That doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that a harder, Nietzschean view is not required in order to survive. Treating people at the individual level is nice, but as we see we must never lose sight of the flip side of the coin, that is how groups are likely to behave on the whole, or what we sacrifice in choosing &#8216;non-judgementalism&rsquo;. The world is not made of buttercups and vietnamese restaurants. That each group exists, and by the law of nature has a unique purpose or agenda and ability set, is a simple fact of life modernism attempts to hide away in a box, to the detriment of one group only (currently), ours. White men, who built the concept of civilization and the best parts within it.</p>

<p>No, you are a fundamentally anti-white a-hole because you categorically deny whites any right to a racial future.  You <i>demand</i> white extinction yet, at times, perhaps when you think no one&rsquo;s looking, you pretend that it isn&rsquo;t occurring and is not the ultimate outcome of your designs.</p>

I don&rsquo;t desire AmRen to turn into an obsessive anti-Jewish website, but I must say that it is quite ridiculous to imply that Jews are the only people about whom no &#8220;negative&#8221; facts can possibly be documented.</p>

I don&rsquo;t want this, all I ask for is for Jews to no longer consider Europeans their moral inferiors because they have falsified history to protect their image.</p>
<p>Even you admitted that morality isn&rsquo;t necessarily linked to intelligence, unless you seriously believe someone like Tim Wise is motivated not by his selfish desire to come across saintly, no matter the costs for the white children who are beaten to a pulp every cinco de mayo,but by some twisted form or morality.</p>

It assumes people act on principle, when most of the time they do not.  How likely is it that dirt poor common folk during the middle ages were actually impelled to murder Jews based solely on the notion that Jews were Christ killers?  Isn&rsquo;t it equally possible the Jews were perceived as a hostile elite, and the common folk simply erupted in rage at their oppressors?  Is it not possible the &#8220;hatred because of religion&#8221; argument mistakes cause for effect?  In other words, they were not hated because they were Jews, they were &#8220;Jews&#8221; because they were hated?</p>
<p>This line of reasoning seems entirely plausible, based on a lifetime of observing human nature, and also based on the behavior of certain contemporary Jews.  </p>
<p>Mark Zuckerburg, for example.  His is fabulously wealthy and is utterly dominant in the newly emergent realm of social media.  And he uses his wealth and power in the relentless pursuit of open borders, regardless of what that entails for the white founders of this country.</p>
<p>Another example:  The collusion of Abe Foxman and Phil Griffin to sllence Pat Buchanan, whose only &#8220;crime&#8221; was to simply observe that whites were soon to be a minority in the US.  Mr Griffin decided to fire Buchanan because &#8220;such thoughts&#8221; were not &#8220;suitable&#8221; in contemporary America.</p>
<p>And Diane Feinstein, who has been quoted as saying &#8220;someday we&rsquo;ll have all their guns&#8221;, in a direct attack on the 2nd amendment rights held dear by middle American common folk.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on &hellip;Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, Daniel Ellsberg, S. J. Gould &hellip;</p>
<p>Truly &hellip; is there not a pattern here?</p>

<p>The only thing the success of jews demonstrates is that when you take European genes and some of its culture, then severely consolidate wealth among a diminished (and so increasingly tribally loyal) population, then they have drivers and means to facilitate success.<br/>
The jews you likely idealize, do not look like middle eastern people do they? (Einstein looked like a kraut not Arafat).<br/>
They are a bastardized European genetic subset augmented by a strong cultural identity (which they have discouraged among every actual European group that they&rsquo;ve infiltrated), which means, not an exception to the rule. And certainly not superior in any way derived from their own ancestry or culture.</p>
<p>To drive home this point, ancient world Hebrews pioneered nothing new.<br/>
Not writing, not architecture, not technology, not art, not government, none of the hallmarks of a superior society. Even their faith is an amalgam of other older religions in the region. They are similar to the Japanese in that they originate little, but adapt well.</p>
<p>The only possible exception to that would be in honed argumentative debate developed through religious traditions (which did not even come close to the philosophical minds of Greece and Rome). That goes a long way to explain their success as comedians and lawyers, the latter of which in modern society exercise a disproportionate power than would otherwise be afforded them in better days.<br/>
Their greatest area of success, finance, being an arena left to them because Europeans thought it distasteful and rightfully that usury was immoral. Being an immoral culture that had no such ethical qualms about endeavoring in the business of screwing outsiders, then yeah, they were able to prey in that field well. And continued on to the present day.<br/>
If your idea of superior intelligence, is one of guileful bickering and deceit, then sure that skillset will do well in the cesspit of modern life when honor, duals, and even a straightforward punch in the mouth have long been legislated out of the toolbox for correcting a wayward sociopath.</p>

<p>As far as I have been able to understand &#8220;cultural Marxist&#8221; is a derogatory term for social liberal. I am socially conservative. I have always disliked the sexual revolution. I hate criminals and favor a harsh criminal justice system. I am pessimistic about human nature and human potential. I think there is often wisdom in tradition.</p>
<p>I have also studied the writings of Karl Marx. Like any political thinker he should be read for insight rather than doctrine. Marx had valid insights and made critical mistakes.</p>

<p>For example, high IQ does not guarantee morally or socially desirable behavior: it might just make it more harmful, insidious and harder to detect or punish. The comparative success of a distinct ethnic community might be the result of high IQ AND intra-ethnic co-operation. </p>
<p>His comments on antisemitism strike me as rather simplistic, even jejune, and ignorant of any in-depth research.  But he just recites them oblivious to any criticism.  Any acquaintance with Jewish literature shows how Jews often get together to advance their own perceived interests.  There is nothing surprising about this. Whether it is good or bad for other people rather depends on the results.  The prominence of intelligent Jews in science and medicine is good, whereas their prominence in financial racketeering or pornography promotion is not.</p>

<p>If you present documentation on, for example, &#8220;Cultural Marxism&#8221;, by scholars like Dennis Dworkin, he will respond either by saying there are books with opposite views or by expecting you to summarize the contents here - what he won&rsquo;t do is check his own views by reading something else.  As for &#8220;Cultural Marxism&#8221; its own exponents call(ed) their position the New Left or Critical Studies, but Marxism was a component in their drive to control the cultural superstructure rather than the economic base of western society.  We have been over all this before, and I have provided short relevant reading lists - futile in the case of the Nordic Episcopalian - which is why I avoid &#8220;debating&#8221; directly within him.</p>

<p>During the War in Vietnam Marxism was a minority persuasion of some anti war activists. Since that war it has fallen out of fashion. The American Communist Party consists of several thousand members nationwide. The Progressive Labor Party has several hundred members.

<p>A few of these members may be seen at Occupy demonstrations handing out leaflets. That does not mean that the Occupy movement is Marxist.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Marxism&#8221; of Marx differed from that of Lenin, of Mao, of Marcuse and of Slavoj Zizek, just the Christianity of Jesus differed from that of Athanasius, of Zwingli, of Pius XII and of Judge Rutherford. The return of a global crisis of capitalism will produce new forces in this &#8220;tradition&#8221; in an environment already well-prepared by liberal egalitarianism, reverse colonialism and dysgenic chaos.</p>
<p>It is risky to quote the doyenne of conspiracy theory, Nesta Webster, but nearly 100 years ago she pointed out with some truth: &#8220;To that small minority among working-men that comprises the &#8216;revolutionary proletariat&rsquo; the meaning of &#8216;The Communist Manifesto&rsquo;&hellip;is clear enough&hellip;the abolition of monarchy and all ordered government, of property and inheritance, of patriotism, of marriage and the family, of all religion&hellip;and the communal education of children by the State.  This, divested of its trappings, is the real plan of Marxian Socialism, which enveloped in the algebraic phraseology of &#8216;Das Kapital&rsquo; is less easy to discover.&#8221;</p>

<p>LBJ unknowingly started the modern Liberal domino-effect because he was a sinister fool. LBJ started recklessly spending in Vietnam and with the so-called &#8220;war on poverty&#8221; welfare state, then he threw in the immigration Act for good measure. </p>
<p>You can trace the decline of the country right back to 1965.</p>

They too have and an aging population, but they lead the world in robotics. Their new conservative government is already rebuilding their military and proposing to change their pacifist constitution. Their new aircraft carrier that is designed to accommodate drones has infuriated the Chinese. The Japanese create technology that the Chinese have to buy or steal from Western countries. The Japanese are just biding their time and waiting for US power to wane.</p>

<p>The number of warriors among our people has been on the decline since long before the Industrial Revolution.  Post-IR technology and socio-political reality has steadily amplified the selection pressure against the warrior gene.  The American Civil War and two World Wars in Europe killed off a huge proportion of our bravest and reduced the number of our warriors to a pittance.   Something/s in the environment is causing a drop in the testosterone levels of Western man.  So tell me again why we are bothering with any of this?  Most of our remaining warriors have been co-opted by the regime.   It pays more and the career prospects are better.  The remainder are too few, too scattered, and lack the resources to change anything - that is, unless they are willing to fight extremely dirty and are willing to lose 3 or 4 for every one of the regime&rsquo;s warriors.  There is simply no persuading the plutocracy controlling the regime to our point of view, for they have always hated us and are protective of their position and status.  When John Derbyshire says we&rsquo;re &ldquo;scre*w*d,&rdquo; I believe him.</p>

White people in the US are not &#8220;genetically&#8221; docile, nor are they unreliable, nor are they untrainable. To conclude that a population that has no reason to rise up in an organized manner and rebel, has been genetically tamed is not logical. One does not necessarily follow from the other. There are many reasons why they are currently docile. The Spartans fed their slaves breakfast, lunch and dinner, while the Spartan&rsquo;s themselves only ate an evening meal. Being over fed makes one docile.</p>

<p>&#8220;the Athanasian paradox that one is three, and three but one, is so incomprehensible to the human mind, that no candid man can say he has any idea of it, and how can he believe what presents no idea? He who thinks he does, only deceives himself. He proves, also, that man, once surrendering his reason, has no remaining guard against absurdities the most monstrous, and like a ship without a rudder, is the sport of every wind. With such persons, gullibility which they call faith, takes the helm from the hand of reason, and the mind becomes a wreck.&#8221;  &mdash;  Thomas Jefferson</p>

I wonder sometimes if our blessing can, at times, become a curse. Might our propensity to establish and defend our chosen forms of government also have contributed to our self-inflicted genocide. I wonder how the world would be today if all the white men killed in the American civil war, WWI, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam had lived and had large families.</p>

<p>They like to diminish terms proactively, too. For example, someone on the Right began speaking of <i>Diversity Fatigue.</i> When the Right began using it the term meant just what it sounds like: <i>people are tired of basing everything on identity politics.</i> </p>
<p>Within a few months the <i>Diversity Devils</i> had stolen the term and flipped the definition to meaning a need to <i>&#8216;&hellip;redouble their efforts&hellip;&rsquo;</i>-a favorite rhetorical term used by the social engineers. They stole it and flipped it&rsquo;s meaning. </p>

Unfortunately for whites, their greater individualistic tendencies have made them more receptive to the notion that all human beings should be treated as individuals and that racial/sexual differences don&rsquo;t matter. Only in white societies will you find the majority of people concerned about the eradication of &ldquo;racism&rdquo;; only in white societies will you find the majority of people promoting their own ethnic suicide through massive 3rd world immigration. The globalists have exploited this Achilles&rsquo; heel to their own personal advantage, allowing the hyperindividualist societies created by whites to be destroyed from within by highly nepotistic, ethnocentric and collectivist ethnic minorities.</p>

The Catholic Church allowed Conquistadors to marry Incas, Mexicas and Peruvians, creating Mestizos and dividing tribal loyalties forever.  It&rsquo;s the divided loyalties through miscegenation that makes solidarity and identity for any tribe impossible.  As a result, the Americas have been forever mired with low-IQ, illiterate rabble.  If you look at the Mexicans coming across the American border and beheading people you&rsquo;ll see the same tribal cult from Apocalyto.  Genetically there&rsquo;s little difference.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a considerable amount of failures in mixing with blacks and Amerinds, far more failure than success.  The historic details tell us of Conversos paying passage to flee with the Conquistadors are lacking, considering secrecy was the most important need for survival, however DNA gives us evidence.  Entire cities of northern Mexico have DNA indicating they&rsquo;re related to Spanish Jews (Shephardic primarily).  What happened?  Same thing that happened to the Jews in the 60&#8242;s and 70&#8242;s that had mixed race Negro babies - most stopped being Jews.  Why?  When you&rsquo;re &#8220;The People of the Book&#8221; the minimum requirement is literacy.  If your children&rsquo;s IQ collectively drops far below 100 you can kiss that tradition goodbye.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a pattern in Negroes, and to a lesser extent Latinos, of explicitly murdering intelligence, not out of &#8220;fear&#8221; or &#8220;difference&#8221; either as many will claim.  The ancient Amerinds murdered their most successful, that much is documented.  Since this is a discussion of genes and culture we&rsquo;d be wise not to ignore it.  However, if you just do a search on &#8220;acting white&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll find hundreds of millions of pages dedicated to blaming whites for everything for both desegregation AND segregation to evil SAT scores.  Use your verbal IQ to manipulate the searches and you&rsquo;ll find teens and adults murdering the most successful of their race claiming they&rsquo;re &#8220;acting white.&#8221;  This is not the same as locking up Galileo, which most people know nothing about and only parrot the Marxist slogans.  This is murdering someone because they scored well on a math test.  One might be able to understand killing a stranger from another tribe for taking your place but killing your own for merely excelling, not even succeeding belongs exclusively in the Black and Brown World.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although some Yanomami really have been engaged in intensive warfare and other kinds of bloody conflict, this violence is not an expression of Yanomami culture itself. It is, rather, a product of specific historical situations: The Yanomami make war not because Western culture is absent, but because it is present, and present in certain specific forms. All Yanomami warfare that we know about occurs within what Neil Whitehead and I call a &#8220;tribal zone&#8221;, an extensive area beyond state administrative control, inhabited by nonstate people who must react to the far-flung effects of the state presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>First-rate logic, that.</p>

Or, one might conjecture that what I read some years ago has undergone historical revision for PC reasons.<br/>
Instead, all the Aussie websites glorify Abo culture, stating that Cook and other early explorers did not spend time among them, so how could they know? One site suggested that Abos have always used fire, even carrying hot coals to ignite the next campsite fire.<br/>
The &#8220;noble savage&#8221; who suffered at the hands of evil White man is alive and well Down Under as well as here.</p>

DNA studies show that Tibetans split off from Han Chinese only 3,000 years ago, so it must be only since then that Sherpas evolved their ability to function so well at high altitudes&#8221;&hellip;.</p>
<p> This is contrary to an article that appeared a week or two ago which stated that the modern Tibetans are a milling of Sherpa and Chinese. The Sherpa, the theory goes, developed the adaptation first, then bred with Chinese to create what are today called Tibetans. There is no reason that the adaptation could not be far older than Tibetans. The Sherpa could have been carrying it for millennia.</p>

<p>In this post you switch tack from claiming that the process of racial extinction is not occurring to the claim that it is a non-issue, quite likely wishing to imply that it is inevitable. I agree that the process is occurring, but I regard its long-term consequences as highly undesirable.  Making those long-term consequences known would heighten resistance to the practice and suggest an alternative course of racial policy, and this, one must suspect, is why you are so hell-bent on denying those consequences or portraying them as inevitable.</p>

<p>A melding of the world&rsquo;s population as it is today would result in an average IQ well below 100.  Demographic trends are dysgenic, meaning that a future melding would result in an IQ even lower.  These trends are unlikely to reverse themselves.  Attaining a mean global IQ higher than 100 seems very unlikely in the absence of eugenic population policies.  If such policies could be implemented to raise global IQ they could also be implemented to raise white IQ and to safeguard white existence.  Your reply does not address this point at all.</p>

<p> There could very well be a totally different explanation and that that is that the races have always been different, that there has been no &#8220;evolving&#8221;. The Europeans developed the Roman civilization over  two thousand years ago. The civilization then fell due to several factors, some of which may have been natural phenomenon such as climate changes, plagues, etc. The fall of that civilization did not mean that the genetics of the white race backpedaled. It could be that the natural abilities and traits  of the white race have always been the  same. Recent research into the antikythera mechanism show that it is much more advanced than previously thought, by about 1,500 years.  There is truly a fetish for the darwinian notion of &#8220;evolution&#8221;, but what people such as this author are calling &#8220;evolution&#8221; is not evolution at all, at most it is adaptation or breeding.</p>

The west has often had times where orthodoxies ruled absolutely yet all of those orthodoxies eventually succumbed to truth. The first ones to find a fault with the orthodoxy have always been treated as pariahs and persecuted. The record  though is that the world of the white man values truth and reason more than it values it&rsquo;s orthodoxies and their institutions. Truth and reason do not exist at all in the african mind, and the asian mind is too submissive too conformist to stray from the accepted beliefs. Look at Chinese writing. It requires incredible numbers of hours to memorize the characters and to practice reproducing them.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-458627" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Mr. Wade writes that his book is an attempt &ldquo;to dispel the fear of racism that overhangs discussion of human group differences and to begin to explore the far reaching implications of the discovery that human evolution has been recent, copious and regional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not possible. If human differences have &ldquo;far reaching implications&rdquo; there is no way to &ldquo;dispel the fear&rdquo; of what goes by the name of &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; What, to begin with, are these far reaching implications? Mr. Wade himself manages to propose exactly one: that foreign aid is probably wasted because poor countries are not genetically prepared for the institutions necessary for wealth.<br/>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>People are deluded to such an extend that only radical honesty or openness about race might still convert them. My awakening was a personal odyssey, and it was the result of my clashing with the norms of liberal society. I do not think that it was worth trying to conceal the implications of this book, because that might even make the defence much more complicated. </p>
<p>People are highly suspicious of others who challenge their beliefs, and especially when they are prone to associate negative stereotypes with others who challenge their beliefs. We are just fascists, nazis or racists to them. We have not moved beyond the stage of being perceived as certain stereotypes, and staying marginalised is actually the most frightening thing for us. People do not understand us, and are unwilling to understand us. What to do?</p>
<p>In any case, I wish the author good luck. May he awaken more people.</p>

But it also explodes the myths of the religiously inclined and proves that Nigerian and Somali refugees and other third world racial groups cannot become civilized white men simply by reading the Bible and accepting Jesus Christ as their savior.  </p>
<p>Not surprisingly Wade hurled the obligatory broadsides at figures of the racialist far right from the early 20th century and affirmed his commitment to racial equality in an obvious attempt to forestall criticism from the equalitarian and totalitarian left.  I would have rather he find his courage and flip the left the proverbial bird, but courage is in short supply these days.</p>
<p>If a sufficient number of the American public could read, think critically, and reach logical conclusions then this rotten multicultural edifice would collapse like a house of cards.  Unfortunately, we live in an idiocracy so the book will have a marginal impact at best.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-458646" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>A major problem for america and the world is that the best and brightest american jews are disappearing through intermarriage with white gentiles.  The New York Times recently published a report showing that 71% of secular/reform jews are intermarrying; those jews are the best and brightest jews.  So, we americans can expect to receive fewer Nobel prizes and receive less innovation in science, medicine, physics, and the arts as our jews disappear.  Even if you hate the jews   &mdash;   and I don&rsquo;t   &mdash;   you will miss them when they&rsquo;re gone. </p>

Asians are the new Jews in classical music, too. There are some good Asian orchestras and soloists. Fine, but playing and creating are two different things.<br/>
Even in the decadent past several decades, Jewish artistic output (as far as I&rsquo;m aware) has been significant, but not overly impressive. Look at movies. Who&rsquo;s the best Jewish filmmaker you know of? Woody Allen? Steven Spielberg? Woody Allen practically worships Ingmar Bergman, who certainly wasn&rsquo;t a Jew. Anyway, I&rsquo;m not trying to sound like I know everything about the arts, but I haven&rsquo;t seen any reason to think Jews have a whole lot going for them artistically.</p>

lol, Dude I am much more likely to be listening to Klaypex, Duran Duran, or The Cult. I do love Bach, Vivaldi, and Chopin though&hellip; Love all kinds of music, so I&rsquo;d never hold someone&rsquo;s musical tastes against them.<br/>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-458672" class="dsq-comment-message"><p><i>Mr. Wade goes over some of the same ground, pointing out how dramatic a<br/>
change it was for our ancestors to switch from nomadic hunting to<br/>
settled agriculture.</i></p>
<p>This is why I think humanity is slowly getting less intelligent.  The foresight to invent agriculture, metallurgy, the wheel, written language, portable alphabets, base-numerical systems with zero as a placeholder, basically all the things which took humanity from hunter-gatherer to agriculture-based civilization, took a lot of intelligence.  There have been a lot of great inventions since the start of the industrial revolution, but it does not seem that any of them have had the dramatic effects and domino effects of, say, inventing agriculture.</p>
<p><i>Smash-and-grab made sense for fast-moving nomads but not for city-dwellers who had to live with neighbors.</i></p>
<p>A problem we still have with us.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Wade makes the crucial point that what is known as &ldquo;national character&rdquo; is undoubtedly genetic, and that is why group behavior is consistent. Jews prosper everywhere they go. So do overseas Chinese. If the Malays and Indonesians envy the success of their Chinese minorities, why don&rsquo;t they just copy their good habits? Mr. Wade argues that they can&rsquo;t; they don&rsquo;t have the genetic predisposition to act Chinese.  Africans likewise cannot maintain government institutions. Their colonial masters wrote nifty constitutions for them, showed them how elections work, and explained the importance of an independent judiciary. That all ended up in the ditch once Africans took over.</i></p>
<p>This is why I think a socio-political ideology and the people and civilization that developed it and whose evolution caused it and in turn it helps the group&rsquo;s evolution are inseparable.  It&rsquo;s why white people can have political ideology and the black African cannot, but it also manifests at finer gradations, why the northern-western European can have ideologies that are more libertarian than authoritarian while the Russians, among others, have ideologies that are more authoritarian than libertarian.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Wade repeatedly emphasizes the importance of public trust &mdash; the ability to deal fairly with people who are not kin or fellow tribesmen. If a race has not evolved this level of trust it will not get beyond tribalism.</i></p>
<p>Except racialism IS tribalism.  The tribe is lot bigger.  Because:</p>
<p><i>That is why Americans can&rsquo;t get Iraqis or Afghans to behave like good democrats no matter how many of them we shoot. Middle Easterners don&rsquo;t have the genetic capacity for republican government, so it is just as crazy to try to force our ways on them as it would be to try to turn Americans into tribalistic, cousin-marrying Afghans.</i></p>
<p>And, at the risk of attracting HBD Chick here, there&rsquo;s the reason behind that:  Cousin marriage.  Which means that the fundamental unit of loyalty in tightly endogamous people is the immediate family.</p>
<p><i>Academics have long chased their tails trying to explain why some countries are rich and others poor. Mr. Wade points out that their fatal blunder is to assume that all populations are interchangeable. He uses findings by the economic historian Gregory Clark to suggest that in Britain, where records go back far enough to make such studies possible, there was steady evolution towards the qualities crucial to the Industrial Revolution.</i></p>
<p>And all the qualities he lists could also be found in the Alexandrian Empire, aka the Hellenistic Empire, aka Hellenistic Greece.  Why didn&rsquo;t the industrial revolution spark then and there?  Either it didn&rsquo;t have enough time, or it was just a matter of fate.</p>
<p><i>Chinese rulers showed an utterly un-European lack of interest in science and exploration, and argues that this reflected long-bred traits of conformity and submission to authority.</i></p>
<p>The Chinese explored, if and only if the ruling authority had a thing for it.  What often happened is that the next ruler that came in had no interest, so China could develop no exploratory verve that was a constant across generations and regimes.</p>
<p><i>None of this belongs in a book about science. It is a clearly an attempt to demonstrate virtue and avoid beatings, but it won&rsquo;t work.</i></p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s blatantly hypocritical considering the rest of the book&rsquo;s contest.  I happen to think it&rsquo;s his get-out-of-being-fired-free card, or so he thinks.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Wade&rsquo;s discussion of the MAO-A gene is even more contortionist. He concedes that American blacks are no less than 50 times more likely than whites to carry the variant most closely tied to violence, but says we must draw no conclusions: Whites might have different, as yet undiscovered, alleles that would make them just as violent.</i></p>
<p>All we have to do is look at areas where black people and white people are under the same political jurisdiction to see that there are no such alleles.  In this case, I think absence of evidence IS evidence of absence.</p>
<p><i>And yet there is no mental plague in China that even approaches the conformity and closed-mindedness Mr. Wade is trying to combat with this book.  The ease with which our rulers have driven common sense about race, sex, and nation underground shows how cowardly and conformist the heirs to the Industrial Revolution have become. </i></p>
<p>And a mental plague Wade himself prostrates to, a plague which his soon-to-be former employer has helped bring about and enforce.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Wade writes that his book is an attempt &ldquo;to dispel the fear of racism that overhangs discussion of human group differences and to begin to explore the far reaching implications of the discovery that human evolution has been recent, copious and regional.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like trying to sell cows to people who hate hamburger and steak.  The NYT and the crowd it caters to is on the wrong side of these crucial issues not be cause they&rsquo;ve made idle long term mistakes, but because they are either ideologically or ethnically or both invested in what we would call wrong ideas, but for them are right ideas.  A hammer won&rsquo;t stop being a hammer because it&rsquo;s bad for nails.  A hammer necessarily exists at the bane of nails.  And hammers aren&rsquo;t going to give up being hammers because the nails somehow have a better or a more clever argument.</p>
<p><i>That is why the reaction to this book will be so interesting. Lefties will not be placated by the back-cover assertion that &ldquo;Wade believes deeply in the fundamental equality of all human peoples.&rdquo; They will realize that a very respectable figure is blowing a raspberry at their religion.  The smartest thing they could do is ignore A Troublesome Inheritance.</i></p>
<p>And that is what I think they will do, after the NYT quietly fires Nicholas Wade.</p>

He didn&rsquo;t come up with his famous equation. He didn&rsquo;t come up with four dimensional space-time. He didn&rsquo;t come up with the idea for the atom bomb. I&rsquo;m not a super genius, and although I&rsquo;ve read in several places why he should get credit for Relativity I&rsquo;ve never understood any of those explanations.</p>
<p>Einstein did not win the Nobel prize for Relativity because he did not earn it. Most of the groundwork – for Relativity – was laid by Henri Poincaré and Hendrik Lorentz over a span of time stretching more than a decade. They worked very diligently pulling it out of Maxwell&rsquo;s equations. The geometry of four dimensional time space was worked out by Hermann Minkowski; who had in turned been prompted by Poincaré.</p>
<p>All of them are White men. None of them are Jews. Why shouldn&rsquo;t they get the credit? Why have I never even heard of them until recently? I don&rsquo;t mind saying that makes me very angry.</p>

Einstein: The Incorrigible Plagiarist&#8221;. Not many people delve into such<br/>
esoteric history as this as Mr. Bjerknes has. Interesting you site a<br/>
common propagandist technique &#8216;straw-men&rsquo; when your post is a variant of<br/>
 one in itself &#8220;ad hominem&#8221;. Let&rsquo;s discuss whether or not Sir Newton<br/>
actually said that rather than deriding the source. Are you prepared to<br/>
do that? I don&rsquo;t think you are because first, everyone has heard of<br/>
Newton and all of his works are too widely spread to discount any quotes<br/>
 of his.  I think any decent college library would have the necessary<br/>
source material such as Poincare&rsquo;s works etc., etc. Once again, as with<br/>
most of the tribe&rsquo;s manufactured &#8220;herors&#8221;, Einstein joins the Emperor in<br/>
 having &#8220;no clothes&#8221;.</p>

<p>I do know that &#8220;Operation Paperclip&#8221; disclosed evidence that the Reich had done extensive research and experimentation on nuclear weaponry well prior to the end of the war, and that they were much further along than the allies had any idea of.</p>

<p>This is exactly what the US (or whatever comes after it) will be in a half-dozen or more generations. Civic trust will not be able to withstand such a weight of differences. Doubtless this is why the Middle East (a genetic crossroads for the planet) is as screwed up as it is. The ancestors of the Ashley Montagus of the West came from the Middle East and they have been tirelessly culturally terraforming the West into an approximation of their homelands. I would argue that this is unintentional on their part; nevertheless the traits which preserved these people express themselves in cultural characteristics which (if given power) recreate such societies. </p>
<p>People see Brazil as the US&rsquo;s future (and so it is); but what is Brazil&rsquo;s future (and ergo the US&rsquo;s more distant future)? It is the Middle East - coffee-colored tribes of varying hue at perpetual war with one another over the scraps of faith, culture and industry left behind by their betters. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that this cannot be stopped. But if things continue apace I don&rsquo;t see it playing out any other way.</p>

The fact that Asians have complex alphabets proves that they possess the gift of memorization but lack the &#8220;creativity&#8221; to adapt to an alphabet with only 26 or so characters. Some of their dictionaries contain 50,000+ characters. Imagine being able to read an entire encyclopedia and memorizing everything contained within, people might say you are smart but it would not say much about your ability to create, reason, rationalize or have original thought.</p>
<p>Once you read and repeat what you are taught, you only know what you have read. Being able to decipher what part of that is true and real is a much better trait than memorization.</p>
<p>Because of what is and isn&rsquo;t being taught in schools these days and what is broadcast by Hollywood and the MSM we are getting quite a batch of misinformed, indoctrinated young people who don&rsquo;t know why we fought in WW2, but know about the exploits of the Tuskegee airmen. They are being handed diplomas, being recognized as intelligent, but I doubt they even carry the DNA that might truly have allowed them to pass junior high.</p>

Liberal tactics, answer a question with a question or answer a question that has not been asked.<br/>
Polls are subjective and manipulative, but I suspect like me, most people don&rsquo;t hate Jews. I have no hostility towards them, I simply see the bad side that everyone has been talking about through the ages on every corner of the earth except your little corner. But just as there are good and bad blacks, so there are good and bad of others and in virtually all cases their stereotypes may be exaggerated but they are certainly earned. That is just reality. Remember reality? or are you only a realist where blacks are concerned?</p>

<p>If there is I do not know why. There is no legitimate reason for disliking either group. Both groups tend to be more intelligent and prosperous than white Gentiles. Orientals have lower rates of crime and illegitimacy than white Gentiles. I have not found figures comparing the rates of crime and illegitimacy of Jews and white Gentiles. I am confident that Jews have lower rates. Those with more intelligence, education, and income usually do have lower rates.</p>

<p>You are right, however there is no legitimate reason to deny that all groups have negative, as well as, positive attributes.

<p>The point I have made is that by tangible measurable criteria it is easy to demonstrate black deficiencies. They tend to be less intelligent than whites. They have higher rates of crime and illegitimacy. These deficiencies can be documented using credible sources of data. </p>
<p>Now in saying this I am well aware that there are decent and capable blacks.</p>
<p>What I keep asking is this: what are the tangible deficiencies of Jews and Orientals? Show me the numbers. I want statistics. </p>
<p>When people try to justify their hostility toward Jews and/or Orientals they mention anecdotes, or they speak in vague measurable generalities. For example, they will say that Jews are parasites. Oh yes? How? Do they have a high rate of welfare dependency? No they don&rsquo;t. Neither do Orientals.</p>

Race realism means that the races differ significantly in average behavior and ability, that these differences are durable, and that they evolved over a long period of time.

<p>jews still do not account for the majority of historical advance (because they spend all their time lining their coffers). they have asiatic hearts. your iq &amp; SAT scores do not encompass everything. for our predecessors (the likes of spengler, ford, stoddard, washington and others) the evidence of history and their own eyes were enough to.make them &#8216;race realists&rsquo;. you live in a fantasy land and are nothing like  like a realist. btw you do not represent popular opinion with your mindless &#8216;asians are superior&rsquo; talk</p>

<p>Your claim that Jews lack a &#8220;sense if [sic] idealism,&#8221; and that they have, &#8220;a kind of rotten, undesirable culture,&#8221; only reveals your own blinkered way of looking at the world. </p>

You have no concept of how subjective reality is, or that you even have a bias yourself. You live in perpetual childish naivety of a much wider world. Jews are over-represented in the porn industry for a start, promote liberalism via their media ownership, promote miscegenation and immigration. They do not tend to go into idealistic fields, such as engineering or exploration, but prefer banking, money lending, mercantile activities. Would you try to deny that? From there they promote terrible modern fashions, sexualize young children and promote black &#8216;music&rsquo;. For the wretched destruction and stupidity of the jewess Betty Freidans radical feminism alone we have paid a most loathsome price. Wherever they touch art or architecture we find hideous anti-aesthetic modernism. They mutilate their childrens genitals, and the orthodox look positively ridiculous. Google jews and porn for a start to your new education, engelman</p>

In any area of human development.<br/>
They never led any field until mixing with European culture and DNA and sucking off its collective teat to build capital.<br/>
That is the simple historical fact.<br/>
They had a documented difficult time of even evolving past nomadic tribes into a monarchy. And the best architecture accomplished was a pretty crappy and simplistic temple.<br/>
Nothing rivaling Egyptian structures, or Greek philosophy, or Roman organization and government.<br/>
I guess they were just held back for all those thousands of years.<br/>

<p>Jews who could not learn the skills did not have children, or they left the faith.</p>
<p>After the French Revolution anti Jewish discrimination in Europe lessened. It became obvious that Jews were exceptionally intelligent. </p>
<p>Jewish intelligence evolved in response to religious persecution. It gave rise to secular persecution because many gentiles resented it, and the prosperity it enabled Jews to achieve.</p>

minorities against the whites, we will instill in the whites a guilt complex for their supposed exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Blacks to rise to prominence in every walk<br/>
 of life and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to intermarry<br/>
with the whites and will begin the process which will deliver America to our cause.&rdquo;<br/>

More fun quotes for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marx was a Jew. His manner of thought was Jewish. His keenness of intellect was Jewish; and one of his forebears was a most distinguished rabbi endowed with a powerful mind.&rdquo; N.H. Bialik, in an address delivered at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, May 11, 1933, which appeared in Lines of Communication, Palestine, July, 1933 .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some call it Marxism  &mdash;  I call it Judaism.&rdquo; The American Bulletin, Rabbi S. Wise, May 5, 1935.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marxism is the modern form of Jewish prophecy.&rdquo; Reinhold Niebur, speech before the Jewish Institute of Religion, New York, October 3, 1934</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bolshevist officials of Russia are Jews. The Russian Revolution with all its ghastly horrors was a Jewish movement.&rdquo; The Jewish Chronicle, Sept. 22, 1922.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is much in the fact of Bolshevism itself, in the fact that so<br/>
many Jews are Bolshevists. The ideals of Bolshevism are consonant with many of the highest ideals of Judaism.&rdquo; Jewish Chronicle London, April 4, 1919.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Communist soul is the soul of Judaism. Hence it follows that,<br/>
just as in the Russian revolution the triumph of Communism was the triumph of Judaism, so also in the triumph of fascism will triumph Judaism.&rdquo; (A Program for the Jews and Humanity, Rabbi Harry Waton, p. 143-144).</p>

Since the have no social circles that will accept them they instinctively form &#8220;teams&#8221; and see &#8220;teams&#8221; that will accept them.</p>
<p>If the &#8220;Anglican&#8221; church was an explicit ethnocentric and racial institution England would still be English and most would simply shrug off the notion of &#8220;racism&#8221;, but the Anglican church delusions of Liberal &#8220;racial equality&#8221; and &#8220;racial harmony&#8221; were appearing during Charles Dickens&rsquo; time.  He was explicit in his hatred for Liberal Christianity that characterized Exeter Hall which became the worship of Negroes and the hatred of Whites.  In their pathology they supported the Jamaican Insurrection where freed slaves murdered, raped, and robbed the whites who helped them.  This same pathology is now mainstream and it&rsquo;s become a full blown suicidal, secular religion.</p>

Truth is not all races are ready for civilization and never will be. whether we want to deal with Eugenics and Sterilization as a whole does not matter because the nation that master them will inherit the earth. William G. Simpson said it best that if we do not deal with the mass of human garbage then we will drown in it. I agree with Galton and the others mentions and it shows how cowardly Wade is for attacking them and bringing the holocaust into is low also. Nature is about survival of the fittest and we are not evolving as a race but rather stagnating and dying off. The best of us no longer care about family and are being outbred by the lower class.</p>

I believe once the human genome is fully unlocked then we will have the true origins of all the races. As for the Japan. Korea and China, they all modernized after contact with us because when our navy showed up Japan was still in the Middle Ages but they proved they were good at assimilating our technology.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-503293" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Henri de Tourville (1842-1903), largely influenced by Paul de Rousiers&rsquo;s study of American society, &#8220;American Life,&#8221; developed a classification of four types of families, based on childhood socialization patterns and types of values: </p>
<p>(1) The &#8216;patriarchal family&rsquo; emphasizes the importance of the family community over the individual; self-denial is taught, individuality is suppressed, and children are not expected to form new family communities on their own. Societies in which patriarchal families dominate are generally conservative and stagnant. </p>
<p>(2) The &#8216;quasi-patriarchal&rsquo; family develops a certain minimum of initiative in members of the younger generation, but on the whole maintains the patriarchal family organization; individual members may leave for a certain period of time, but since they generally lack the initiative to form their own family community, they often return. These first two types were dominant in eastern and central Europe. </p>
<p>(3) The &#8216;unstable family&rsquo; instills neither the respect for authority and tradition found in the patriarchal family nor the sense of individual initiative of the particularist family. To fill the void, the state must provide remunerative employment and moral direction; isolated individuals and unrelated nuclear families depend on a centralized governmental bureaucracy for support. Such families were found in France and Germany. </p>
<p>(4) The &#8216;particularist family&rsquo; instills in its children a strong sense of individuality and personal initiative; children are expected to manage their own affairs at a relatively young age and to form their own separate nuclear families. The particularist family was dominant in most Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon countries. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The Saxon&rsquo;s power arose from what we would now call nuclear families. Henri de Tourville, in his &#8220;The Growth of Modern Nations&#8221; (1907), believes this small family came into being in the following way: some Teutonic or Nordic people reached the plains of Sweden and in their search for undisturbed homes, passed on over the mountains and settled along the fiords of Norway. When the families of a fiord grew too large, the younger members gathered together, stocked a few ships and voyaged southwards, seeking land for themselves in fiords farther south, in the projecting thumb of Denmark, in the northwestern river-lands of Germany, and finally in the island of Britain. In the new settlements, the love of independence led to the persistence of the small family system.</p>
<p>However rude and rough these early Angles may have been, there are few Englishmen now who will not be thrilled, when they read how Tacitus, coming from the great city-world of Rome, was struck by the jealous independence of each farmer and his family in their settlements. &lsquo;They live apart,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;each by himself, as woodside, plain or fresh spring attracts him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They could not, however, be quite independent. Dangers from other peoples sometimes threatened them and they then joined together, chose a chief and took to arms. They were fierce fighters and, when they arrived in Britain under their captains, they drove the Britons westwards or slew them, and took their land, until once more they were independent farmers at peace. They were the forerunners of similar settlers in America, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Saxons came to dominate all the other invaders, Angles, Danes, Normans, because of their cultural practices, particularly nuclear families, which Tourville calls &ldquo;particularist&rdquo; social structure. The Saxons generated a unique type of state apparatus as a result, operating large states on a federal-type basis.</p>
