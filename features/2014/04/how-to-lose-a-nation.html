<p>The praises Eric Hobsbawm received upon death, an unrepentant apologist for Stalin&rsquo;s crimes, but also the increasing popularity of Slavoj Zizek show Marxism is a minor but still potent and influential ideology. Cultural Marxism dominates the Western world though.</p>

The main similarity is an attack on our civilization and the nations that built it.  There were variations among the Frankfurt School people, but the main thrust of its followers such as Marcuse that concerns us is their enlistment of collectivized &#8220;deviants&#8221; - &#8220;wimmin/wyomin&#8221;, blacks, immigrants, LGBTs and the &#8220;differently abled&#8221; - as tools for a pseudo-egalitarian revolution.  Such people called their movements &#8220;New Left&#8221; or &#8220;Critical Studies&#8221;, and opponents called them &#8220;Cultural Marxists&#8221;. They still exert considerable influence through &#8220;political correctness&#8221; in academe, publishing, journalism, politics and even the churches.</p>

The problem is that Russians traditionally have considered Europeans as foes. The current regime is no different. Perhaps the demographic changes makes them realize what their ethnic background actually means.They are on their way to becoming a minority within their own homeland.</p>

American  culture has become steadily more Africanized, and this is the single most important force behind the decay of America.

The average American high school student is surely not into Klezmer music or even Barry Manilow anymore than they are into Mario Lanza or Frankie Yankovic. They are into rap garbage and auto tune microphone garbage. They worship at the moronic altar of Black culture, and have lost an appreciation for their heritage. Jewish heritage and culture is a casualty of this right along with all Gentile European heritage.</p>

As far as music, it is clear that White Libtarded and Capitalist Pig types are doing much of the marketing of Black music to the White masses, and that this has been the case ever since Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, the first Wig*ger boys of the music industry, were marketed to White youth. There is surely a Jewish element amongst thee marketers and producers, this is without question. This Jewish element, though, is comprised of secular Jews who have no pride, and no desire to market anything remotely Jewish. These folks would probably not do a thing to market Barry Manilow if he were a young man these days, let alone a Klezmer Clarinetist such as the late, great Naftule Brandwein. Record producers back in the good old days marketed his music because it is quality music, just as Mario Lanza and Frankie Yankovic were marketed.   My take on this is that youth were encouraged to appreciate quality music in the good old days. The marketing of Elvis/Jerry Lee Lewis as Whites producing Negro style music to White youth was the beginning of Negro culture being marketed to impressionable White youth.<br/>
Let us emphasize impressionable, though, as musically talented White youth have never taken the Negro style pop music drivel seriously. The talented kid who is wrapped up in the band program has an appetite for real music, and quickly becomes a fan of quality music. As a band kid in school, Grandpa&rsquo;s record collection of Klezmer/Polkas/Italian Opera/Orchestral Music had my attention. I could have cared less about that talentless Negroid Michael Jackson wiggling his a*s on stage and screaming some barely decipherable lyrics about how horny he was.</p>

Whites of mediocre talent who fit into the Negro music world gain fame and fortune, and the truly talented are passed by.</p>

Unfortunately, nothing will change unless white nationalists get rid of the mass immigration, multiculturalism regime in Washington<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Whites will cling to whatever tattered cloth protects their eyes from seeing so long as it has woven upon it &#8216;job, home, X-box&rsquo;.<br/>
By the time that ragged cloth is ripped from their faces upon the logistical certainty of a majority third world population status there will be nothing left to fight for or with.<br/>
People think that the crisis point is in 2016 or 2042 or or or.  I say that that crisis is already come and gone.  When whites no longer outnumber the -combined- &#8216;minority&rsquo; population of this country (and we all know 12 million is a phantom number and the reality is closer to 25-30, coupled to 39 million blacks) we lost the ability to dictate the outcome, short of massive civil war in which the majority of our people are too old and/or too fettered with social conscience to be good run&rsquo;n&rsquo;gun trigger pullers.<br/>
So say that you stripped the seated government in being and installed a new one with ideals somewhere right of _The Turner Diaries_ &#8216;off to a canyon you go, never to return&hellip;&rsquo; and that _whites_ didn&rsquo;t set up a fuss.<br/>
Where would that leave us?  With a 10% total population advantage, 20%?<br/>
Hitler couldn&rsquo;t win the war against the Jews in Europe when he was trying to annihilate a mere 9-12 million.<br/>
What do you honestly suppose will happen when the ethnics rise up, full of their &#8216;nor a window to throw it out of&rsquo; single generation connection to savage poverty and make a fight of it?<br/>
Do you think we can control 39+20 million people enough to slaughter or exile them without causing world intervention?<br/>
 Where and how do you plan to send them anyway?  FEMA camps?  Please.<br/>
Populations are like a spring.  Overstretch them and they shatter into a million coil-fragments with all the hollows inbetween acting to isolate them.  COMPRESS them on the other hand and now they are so dense that they cannot go anyway.  And neither can their enemies, in their midst.<br/>
We have already lost the Desert SW and Mexifornia.  We are in the process of losing the South/Southeast and Northeast.<br/>
So.  We draw lines at that Mississippi and the Rockies and we push south to the Grand Canyon and hold there.  We evacuate Dyess, PANTEX, Red River and the Sub Bases on each coast.  We hold onto the nukes in Montana, North Dakota and Missouri, we have a sizeable reserve force against international intervention and we begin again, through the Great Lakes or New Orleans (which is to say, we leave these peoples to rot on the vine, _no help, from -nobody-).<br/>
Their comes a time when, to live, you have to give.  We can either lose America to the &#8216;over stretched spring effect&rsquo; or we can coil-back and let poverty and stupidity have their day and say.<br/>
For whites to remain an undestructed gene base, they must remain a nation in being with a homeland to go with.  When we are thirty million, and the disaster in being is _obvious_, we will still have enough to hold onto the Midwest, slaughter or paid-eviction dislocate those whom we don&rsquo;t want in our midst and move on.<br/>
We will not be able to push out numerically superior forces with equal if not greater presence in the military (how can they not be, when the total white population crashes from old age and sub-replacement breeding?) as access to superior firepower.<br/>
Which is why I asked you how you plan to evict the present power structure, near term.  Because there is a date stamp on how long any political reinvention will functionally make a difference.<br/>
Not least because Hispanic Majority = NAU by default.</p>

White Nationalists can only get rid of this if we get one of our own into the White House.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
1 million legal and .5 million illegal immigrants, plus a severely aging White Base argues against you sir.<br/>
Every four years, there are 6 million more of them and probably 5-10 million fewer of us.<br/>
Republicans are not the problem, if we WANTED TO we could create high level (Apollo/Manhattan) commitment that would produce working anthropomorphic robots which would multiply every single man&rsquo;s work product (and payoff) by double, even doing silly service jobs, inside 6 years.<br/>
America is being weakened for a reason and that reason is a Star Trek like, followon, &#8216;Federation&rsquo; world government.<br/>
And when that happens, whites, are already on the bring of total social collapse as non-commitment to a society that reflects our deepest genetic algorithms to explore, improve and seek excellence _for ourselves and our Kindred_ will be completely lost in a planet of R-Breeders, the majority of whom have no genetic hope of more than a mid-80s IQ.<br/>
Borders are the only thing that secures our genebase sir and those borders are like the Titanic: with a refrigerator sized crack spread along it&rsquo;s length which is letting in just enough water to eventually enable the icecube tray effect which will destroy us, utterly.<br/>
We both know who and how this condition is being imposed upon us by.<br/>
And yet we cannot fight ourselves as the trained paramilitary and military forces who would destroy us utterly did we stand up.<br/>
By the time whites realize we have been had, that a combination of hostile immigration and voter fraud has destroyed our majority, it will be two or three &#8216;generations&rsquo; of ever dumber presidents down the road and there will be 18 million more of them and 20-30 million fewer of us.  _Ontop Of_ the 3.2 TFR and 17-19 year generational rate that is already flooding us from within.<br/>
A Constitution Party will not mean anything at that point.  It will be just another artifact of Democracy which is to say &#8216;give everyone some power and no one has enough to do anything useful&rsquo;.  Like save our people from genocide.<br/>
That is the purpose of representative democracy.  To fragment and filter power through idiocracy, corrupt influence and demographic defeat.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-494348" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>To quote Michel Houellebecq&rsquo;s The Elementary Particles:</p>
<p>&#8221; Metaphysical mutations - that is to say radical, global transformations<br/>
in the values to which the majority subscribe - are rare in the history<br/>
of humanity. The rise of Christianity might be cited as an example.</p>
<p>Once a metaphysical mutation has arisen, it tends to move inexorably<br/>
toward its logical conclusion. Heedlessly, it sweeps away economic and<br/>
political systems, aesthetic judgements and social hierarchies. No human<br/>
agency can halt its progress - nothing except another metaphysical<br/>
mutation.</p>
<p>It is a fallacy that such metaphysical mutations gain ground only in<br/>
weakened or declining societies. When Christianity appeared, the Roman<br/>
Empire was at the height of its powers: supremely organized, it<br/>
dominated the known world; its technical and military prowess had no<br/>
rival. Nonetheless, it had no chance. &hellip; &#8221;</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Western world has since the late 60s experienced some sort of metaphysical mutation that has so transformed the values to which she describes and that it now starts to threaten the very foundation she was built on. </p>
<p>It would be wise to heed Houellebecq&rsquo;s advice that only another metaphysical mutation can halt this progress. Logic and sound judgement won&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>Which we already knew, from the transformations described above by Mr Taylor.</p>
<p>This &#8220;mutation&#8221; analogy doesn&rsquo;t explain anything; in biological evolution, a novel mutation will spread because it offers an advantage to its possessor. It enables the possessor  to out-compete its rivals. How did Christianity contribute to the dominance of Rome and the spread of its civilization? Its message of brotherly love etc is likely to have softened Roman brutality, which would have led to fewer rather than more conquests. Likewise - how does white ethnomaochism benefit the US? It doesn&rsquo;t; it leads (among other things) to the advancement of incompetent minorities, all the way to the top. How does white dispossession benefit the country? It so obviously doesn&rsquo;t that liberals themselves had to concoct a phony justification after the fact - &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221;.</p>

<p>Churches everywhere push miscegenation as a moral imperative.</p>
<p>Christians spin their wheels debated with Useful Idiot Atheists about God, a never ending argument like a cripple fight.</p>
<p>Christianity shows me that Whites need &#8220;religion&#8221; to help us live and prosper in a safe setting.  The problem is Christianity is not White.  It doesn&rsquo;t explicitly contain our tribes (Irish, Greek, Italian, et al) except as bench-warmers to Jesus and Jews.  Because of this we have no kinship to it.  Open the book and we won&rsquo;t learn about ourselves.  How did America come into being?  Ask a Fundamentalist and they&rsquo;ll say &#8220;America is not in the prophecies.&#8221;  That tells me all I need to know.  Our Fundamentalists should be 100% pro-White, not saying we don&rsquo;t exist.</p>

The Good Samaritan parable and some other passages are actually misrepresented to support their aims.  Taking the supernatural gospel to &#8220;all nations&#8221; does not necessarily entail the destruction of &#8220;nations&#8221;.  It is possible to quote Anglican and even Catholic writers against both one-worldism and racial crossing.</p>

This politically correct Libtard garbage about the races being equal, and racism being so evil has no basis in Scripture, or God&rsquo;s will. God created a segregated world, with Caucasians in Europe and the Middle East, Negroids South of the Sahara, and Asiatics East of the Caucasus Mountains. The only reason, ironically, that we Whites even discovered the Negroid race was through our intrepid exploration of the world beyond our ancestral homelands. I hate to see Christianity blamed for Libtard thinking. The Bible speaks against miscegenation, and does so boldly and clearly.</p>

Byzantium was Christian and managed to preserve, largely intact, the social and political institutions of Greek and Roman antiquity until 1453, when Constantinople was sacked by the Turks. What did play a major role in the destruction of the western empire were the massive <i>Völkerwanderungen</i> of Germanic peoples, their settlement within the borders of the empire  and their use as mercenaries in the Roman army. Rome could only handle so much foreign invasion and foreign interference before disappearing from the pages of history.</p>
<p>I wish our western &#8220;leaders&#8221; would read and learn from history. But, as George Bernard Shaw said: &#8220;We learn from history that we learn nothing from history.&#8221;</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-495426" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Christianity was a contributing factor. The old Roman religion was based on ancestral worship, valuing race and promoting heroic values. Christianity was about women&rsquo;s lib, praising the poor and low class etc. Basically the Marxism of its time. Interestingly everybody had to be Christian except Jews who magickally gained special privileges under the Christian system. But even before Christianity Rome had a demographic problem. The racial Romans (called Patriacians or Patriarchs which means the fathers. This reffered to both their status as leaders and also their ancestry as being that of the founding fathers of Rome) were only about 5% of the population. The other 95% were plebs i.e. mostly slaves and various people absorbed by the Roman empire. This alone had problems and despite racial purity laws the Patriarchs were slowly blending with other groups. Christianity sealed the deal by largely breaking those barriers. Only Jews remained distinct under the system. It seems Jews played a large role in creating and promoting Christianity. But also at the time there were climatic issues that caused grain shortages. This led to problems internally in Rome and was the reason the Germanic tribes moved south looking for food and thus eventually rebelled against Rome (they also rebelled because they weren&rsquo;t being treated fairly). Christianity might not have had such a bad effect if the population wasn&rsquo;t already 95% plebian (and cracks were already forming before Christianity came along) and you didn&rsquo;t have the climatic trigger on the fuse along with resentment of Germanic warriors who were fighting for Rome but not being treated fairly.<br/>
The very same thing happened much earlier in Greece though. Again about 95% of the population were racial others and this eventually led to a decay in the social structure. In fact this was the underpinnings of Nazi history as they observed that this &#8220;racial mixing&#8221; led to the decline of societies. It also happened in Persia before it happened in Greece and before that in India (although India upheld its caste system pretty well until relatively recently).</p>

However, there was an historic tension between the Christian mainstream structures and many Jews of the dispersion, already evident in the Acts of the Apostles, John&rsquo;s Gospel and the much earlier first letter of Paul to the Thessalonians. I shall not resurrect my long comment on the reasons for the decline of Rome, but I do believe that dysgenic breeding (including losses from war rather than disease) and multicultural immigration have been key factors in the decline and fall of nations and empires.</p>

But I honestly do not think that will happen. We may lose the the southwestern states, for a time, but if the area demographic trends remain the same, there will still be plenty of regions where whites wield the political power. Eventually, when the non-white regions become too heavy of a burden for whites to support, those white states will secede from those states dominated by non-whites. I mean, I cannot imagine whites in the mid-west sitting idly by, as their wealth and income is taxed at higher and higher rates, to support non-whites who despise them, who live a thousand miles away, and who are a net loss to the GDP. It is true our people tolerate too much abuse now, as it is. However, this is only because too many of us are still brainwashed into believing mass-immigration, diversity, and gay marriage are good things, and that it is moral to declare support for them. Only when it is too costly for whites to embrace such foolishness will we reverse this trend. Once we are backed into a corner, we will fight back and be unstoppable. Think about it, when we were at our zenith, a few ships full of whites were enough to subdue two continents. A small Island of whites ruled 25.00% of the world. Our internal conflicts reverberate throughout the world. We invented civilization, culture, and science. We did this then we were filled with a racial self-confidence. Our dark-age achievements dwarf the pinnacles of 99.00% of all other peoples. Deep down, in our heart of hearts, all of us whites are aware of our greatness as a race, but like an honor student amongst dunces, in order to fit in, we either pretend it is not true or we see it as a mark of shame. We are working towards that critical mass. This video describes one impossible future, impossible, because we will not allow it to happen.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-495993" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Mestizos are a much bigger problem than blacks because of their explosive immigration-fueled population growth. Mestizo colonization of the United States is not only putting downward pressure on wages and living standards all across the country, but is also being used by the federal government to ethnically cleanse whites from large swaths of American territory. Whites are being forced to abandon their communities and livelihoods in order to relocate to predominantly white areas, away from zones of mestizo colonial occupation. The explosive growth of the mestizo population threatens to replace the white majority with a mestizo majority, transforming the United States into an impoverished third world nation, an extension of Latin America.</p>
<p>Because of endless, massive mestizo immigration, mestizos will soon become America&rsquo;s BIGGEST criminal threat. For one thing, the current prison population seriously underrepresents &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; criminality. This is because there are fewer older &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; inmates than older members of other ethnic groups (since there were fewer mestizos 20-30 years ago). However, the number of older mestizos will grow in size as the current population of mestizo criminals age behind bars. Therefore, the best index of the &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; crime rate would be given by the incarceration rate for younger males between the ages of 18-34. </p>
<p>In 2006, 24% (164,700) of male inmates between the ages of 18-34 were mestizos, whereas 40% (276,600) of male inmates between the ages of 18-34 were black. This suggests that the mestizo rate of criminality is over 50% the figure for black males. When the mestizo population doubles in size by 2050, they will easily surpass blacks as the LARGEST ethnic group in prison and the BIGGEST perpetrators of crime in the nation.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this changes the fact that blacks are also a dangerous threat. Nevertheless, their proportion of the population is expected to remain the same over the next four decades, which is why mestizos are far more dangerous.</p>

Then by the time it was the nineties I started seeing Arabs on the South Side of Chicago.  Their goats got lose and were running through traffic on Cicero Avenue.  In my old neighborhood, on 95th and Cicero Avenue the Arab Muslims held a Hizb ut-Tahrir terrorist conference at the Oak Lawn Hilton.  We went from Italians, Irish, and Polish who knew one another, played tag, and would trick or treat on Halloween without fear to Arab Muslim terrorist groups in 20 years.</p>
<p>My friend owns a game store in Sacramento.  They wanted to hang out this evening, play some cards, and then go out for a drink.  My friend&rsquo;s store went from 90% White in 2000 to about 65% White in 2014.  The number of people are the same.  The revenue is gone.  Non-Whites spend almost money, unless they&rsquo;re Japanese.  I saw a woman, or at least I guess it&rsquo;s a women, in a Niqab walking at night on Fulton Avenue in Sacramento.  If she was crossing the street or walking on the road I could have accidentally hit her.  In about 15 years the Whites have abandoned Sacramento.  There are empty lots everywhere, lots where businesses used to be.</p>
<p>The people in Sacramento I see working are Whites, but there are non-Whites everywhere.  The Safeway on Elkhorn has an all White crew that works nights.  They talk to me about the non-Whites and the problems.  Whites know the Police no longer protect them and the laws are against them.  Every White knows they&rsquo;re one false accusation away from a bs &#8220;discrimination&#8221; lawsuit.  Illegals steal groceries and they let them go.  Call the cops and nothing happens because the Feds and ICE won&rsquo;t allow it.</p>

We are being assaulted while our minds are still flexible enough to be permanently warped by genocidal theory.  Imprinting them with beliefs which become second &#8216;nurture&rsquo; rather than naturally (testosterone is a rebel hormone, not merely an aggressive one) contested as they age.  Leading to laws which are unargued for what they suggest as being &#8216;unacceptable&rsquo; in the way of personal preference as group prejudice.<br/>
We are being fed fluoridated water which is known for it&rsquo;s highly depressant effects upon will and intelligence in longterm saturation of brain function.<br/>
We /have been/ subject to all manner of biologic experiments inherent to being injected, sometimes less than an hour out of the womb, with &#8216;vaccines&rsquo; which have absolutely nothing to do with preventing disease (what baby gets Hep-C except from it&rsquo;s already infected mother?) and everything with dosing the brain with Thimerosal and similar, deadly, mercury-alcohol based toxins which literally -inhibit- brain function (by destroying cells), from the beginning.<br/>
Women who used to be healthily fat (among mammals, only penguins and antarctic whale species lay on more fat at puberty, with a ratio of something like 7:1) are now in a fad craze of hyper fitness which reduces the amount of DHA deposited fats rich in Omega 3.  Another critical shortcoming in brain function.<br/>
ALL MANNER of natural and synthetic estrogens are being fed to our people, from plastic bottles and soy-in-everything.  Which also greatly effeminizes safe=socially acceptable responses in men who would have long since flipped the off switch on this diseased experiment in radical Social Engineering by biological warfare means.<br/>
Our best male minds are soup by the time they are able to exercise any discretionary power of their own and increasingly they are punished for doing so in a fashion which favors dominance for their own &#8216;in group&rsquo; (as persecutionally happens for no other protected class).<br/>
Why do you think that is, hmmm?<br/>
What I hope happens is that there comes a threshold decision point where it becomes impossible for whites to be able to continue without being FORCED to either live, close up, with the ugliness of black and hispanic and Islamic and Asian and female dominated behaviors.<br/>
Or rebel completely against them.<br/>
And that women who are a large part and parcel to the design of this process realize the stupidity of disempowering their own males without doing the same to all the OTHER patriarchal societies.  Whose kids they don&rsquo;t want to bear.<br/>
The notion that women are &#8216;less picky&rsquo; than men when it comes to physical features is false.  The certainty that they are frightened when they feel &#8216;unsafe&rsquo; in a work or social environment where they are harassed, forced to lesser and lesser career roles and generally criticized, openly, for not being with a man (of name your race) when they are not explicitly with a /white/ man, will find it impossible to continue to function and so will swing ultra-right conservative lest they lose it all.<br/>
You want to see males act like men?  You watch what an influx of &#8220;Want sex?  DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS!&#8221; white women will do to motivate those who have lost all sense of their dignity and power.  As wantedness of masculine utility.<br/>
As I have said before:  The easiest way to attack the multicult is through homosexuals who are spurned and abused, aggressively, in all non-egalitarian cultures as an extreme skew of unnatural sexual behavior.  It is easy to break up an adhoc victim&rsquo;s coalition which will not defend it&rsquo;s weakest member when NO ONE in that group feels anything but a subconscious sense of &#8220;Ewwwwh, ick&hellip;&#8221; at the thought of &#8216;what that means&rsquo; in evinced behavior as much as bedroom privacy.<br/>
That&rsquo;s how you throw them into disarray.  But what do you do to capitalize on their confusion of non-existent center?<br/>
I would suggest advancing a female friendly alternative agenda, to white women.  Because, liberal or not, white women are the ones who will ultimately lose the most, both genetically and by social station and where they make up 52% of the population group overall, so are they likely to be the heart of any radical liberalism.<br/>
Your vision is saddening to me for this reason: it is the man teetering at the brink, knowing he is too far over to pull back, deciding whether to make his final dive one of windmilling arms and a Wilhelmsian scream or to &#8216;leap like a Skydiver&rsquo; and face plant like he wanted it this way.<br/>
Instead, why not look for the hand at your back that won&rsquo;t push you but pull you back.  We need such allies and we need to win them over on themes that they can think about as beginning, not with contempt, rejection or condemnation for what they have already done but rather:<br/>
&#8220;When we are too weak to protect you, you will fight alone and you will lose, all that you have won so far.  What if we met you halfway on some of your goals and offered you an honorable mergence of winning solutions?&#8221;<br/>
Having direct references to treatment of women in Africa (South Africa is the rape capital of the world and most of the victims are -black-) and Hispanic countries would be a good place to start.<br/>
Beyond which, we absolutely MUST begin to withdraw from the active multicult society into megaclusters of white communities, starving it, quickly, of useful currency exchange at the same time we become strong taxpayers.  Such that the government will hesitate to intervene, knowing we will back any and all victims to the hilt, legally, for whatever crap justification is given.  And that we do not appreciate such attempts to break us up but rather prefer to do what blacks and Hispanics already do:  act self determinantly with regard to criminal, administrative and social rules.<br/>
The key being that this doesn&rsquo;t occur for it&rsquo;s own sake but rather with the view that, from within those communities, we can begin to teach our children, FEED our children and /entertain/ our children, in ways that take them completely out of the loop of modern social, chemical and doctrinal harm.<br/>
We cannot play survivalist games and win.  There are too few who are ready, too few who would not lose more than they -might- gain, endgame.  And far too many who lack the certainty of what is coming to want to take such a risky social position to join outcasts of their own choosing to begin with.<br/>
But we can do this if we go mega groups instead of micro clusters.  Out in the open rather than hidden in shame.  And provide -benefits- which no other group can:<br/>
Free Medical.<br/>
Free Legal.<br/>
Free or Near Free Education with advanced placement from early age.<br/>
Free Nanny Services.<br/>
Shared Defrayment of major bills (mortgages etc.).<br/>
Shared Investments.<br/>
None of which will mean a thing if it doesn&rsquo;t happen with sufficient economies of scale to buy in the kinds of professional classes with the intellect and education to look at the numbers for the Long View and _mean it_ when they say:  &#8220;You&rsquo;ve convinced me, what do I have to do.&#8221;<br/>
At this point, we are at a forward unto mixed racial descent into misery as LCD outcomes.  Or forward, as single races, may the best GROUP win.<br/>
We need to realize what that means, make our choices, win our allies and move forward from here.<br/>
My own perspective is simpler: We will never live to see the outcome of the race struggle that derives from the global resource one.  We may live to see the outcome of an -occupancy- struggle which derives from being the smallest population in the largest landmass.<br/>
I know that my government has descended from being well intended but sociologically immature to outright evil when it refuses to allow the subject of &#8216;what do you want to be&rsquo; be discussed as a fair and even handed discussion based on the consequences of the present racial annihilation policies.<br/>
Hidden agendas are always based on fear of discovered outcomes, not moral intent.<br/>
And once we have sizeable, irreducible (communally owned real property) we will have the basis of FORCING that discussion into the open, just on the differentials in economic SES and quality of life immediately visible.<br/>
While victory is not certain, we are going to lose any other way.</p>

The issue is too hot to handle for the few genuine conservative politicians out there. None of them will dare speak about shutting off legal immigration. Which leaves us where? With the only hope being the breakup of the United States. The only event I see triggering such a breakup would be a massive economic implosion: the Great Depression squared. Under the conditions of extreme stress that such an implosion would create the country MIGHT break apart. Even then the creation of a white nation, most likely in the northern great plains and inter- mountain west, would have to be preceded by great migrations of whites into that area and (mainly) browns out. Such displacements of populations are rarely accomplished peacefully. More likely race separation would be the final outcome of how the wars between or among the inheritor states of the United States turn out. Odds are against it happening. But without a truly traumatic event, which I think will be economic implosion, the breakup of the U.S. followed by the establishment of a white inheritor nation has no chance of happening, IMO.</p>

<p>Get candidates who are professional, knowledgeable, and who speak up in a professional way against the replacement of our people. They don&rsquo;t have to win, they just have to have some people start to listen to them. Try to have influence in the primaries, that&rsquo;s where the presidential candidates are made.</p>

The interpretation of the 14th that grants &#8220;citizenship&#8221; to the children of birth tourists and wetbacks is administrative in nature - it has never been tested in court. There are good reasons to think that the 14th was never intended to grant such citizenship, and cannot be used in that way. The exact wording is:</p>
<p>&#8220;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&#8221; </p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;Subject to the jurisdiction thereof &hellip;&#8221; is thought by many legal scholars to exclude persons who are subjects of a foreign power, e.g. Mexicans. The 14th was rammed through after the Civil War to grant citizenship to freed slaves. It was never conceived to be a gateway to citizenship for trespassers. </p>
<p>The question in setting precedent is one of legal standing - who can sue to stop the gov&rsquo;t from granting paper citizenship to anchor babies? If the government were in the hands of patriots, they could stop granting citizenship to these interlopers and they would have to sue to try to get it back. If only ..</p>

In eras past foreigners have left the land when the economy buckled, and they could potentially do so again.  However, America is not the land she once was, and those who dwell within her borders are not those they once were.  Mass violence is just as likely in such an event, when ironically use of force to remove the invaders could prevent said event entirely.</p>

They&rsquo;ll go through their water in a day and then panic will set in.  Blockade the exits and trap them.  Let their large numbers and inability to plan for the future will work against them. Make alliances with farmers and country folk away from cities to store supplies in remote locations - gas, water, food, and ammo.</p>

Very large dogs will scatter crowds, especially when combined with gunfire.  Keep them panicked and disoriented. The large dogs are expendable. We are not.</p>

No doubt the government is well aware and that&rsquo;s why they bought massive amounts of ammo and have militarized our civilian police force.</p>

If the government collapses the Welfare system and a vast majority of non-Whites starve immediately as they take the most.  Poor Whites then come to us seeking aid and we recruit them into the ranks.  Last year there were riots when the welfare system had a &#8220;glitch&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t think it was a glitch at all.  I think the government was testing the system.  Nevertheless, the police will have a difficult time with 800 or more armed White patriots. They&rsquo;d surrender.  The Federal Government just flinched to Bundy.  Also, remember that Liberals are fking worthless during a SHTF moment.  They&rsquo;ve put all of their trust in government.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s important for Whites to be in Law Enforcement and government.  Even if you&rsquo;re not a &#8220;politician&#8221; you&rsquo;re connected.  Then you can identify who needs to stay and who needs to go.  Don&rsquo;t reveal yourself, just work behind the scenes and point them out.</p>

That is why all these agencies are hoarding hollow-point and armor piercing but flesh shredding bullets. They are illegal to use in combat, but remember WE are not entitled to Geneva convention protections NOR are we people to the ruling class. They plan to shoot us the way a farmer would shoot ground hogs with a varmint rifle. Therefore when the SHTF, we should use any and all weapons and tactics available to us, just as the Ukrainians are about to do right now.</p>

<p>Before 1830, America was 98% protestant with strong ties of kinship and culture and religion to Britain. By opening the gates to Irish Catholic immigration, that homogeneity was fractured. Irish immigrants were hostile to British culture, traditions, and religion.</p>
<p>Catholicism is a universal faith that transcends national boundaries. That Ted Kennedy set out to further undermine American protestant homogeneity is consistent with his universal Catholic faith. Most of the Latinos entering America are brother Catholics. Ted Kennedy then and Nancy Pelosi today must be overjoyed at their taking over.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-495184" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Our beliefs and culture are defined by many variables; IQ being one of the most important, but not the only. Let&rsquo;s point out that White people single-handedly invented the modern world. Whites are still overwhelmingly the innovators and inventors. The much vaunted Asians aren&rsquo;t even a close second in that respect. The rest can&rsquo;t even use or maintain what we&rsquo;ve given them. When nonWhites move to the U.S. or European countries they don&rsquo;t improve at all, and in a malignant climate of Leftist social pathology, nonWhites actually tend to assimilate to the lowest common denominator; the Blacks. This will not change because nonWhites can&rsquo;t change. Their very presence destroys our civilization. Unfortunately their presence is accompanied by aggressive hatred and resentment of the White civilization that has made White countries so attractive to nonWhites in the first place. NonWhites in White countries are parasites; even the ones who support themselves (all too few).</p>
<p>Even the Asians are no good for us at all.</p>
<p>The history of Asian civilization is one long chronicle of brutal tyranny. Even Japan has an insanely invasive government. Asians tend to be rigid, arrogant and conformist to an amazing degree. There is no tradition of innovation. They seem to glom on to Western inventions and methods; in some cases improving them, but Asians haven&rsquo;t made or developed for practical use any of the fundamental inventions in spite of their supposed intelligence. High intelligence as a general Asian population trait is only found in a corner of northern Asia in any case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with a LOT of Asians; mainly Japanese and Chinese and Vietnamese. A few India Indians. They all have this attitude that if a project is done by the book and the prevailing theory, then nothing should go wrong. They make no contingency plans. When things do go wrong, they are mystified and confused. They never plunge into a project with an attitude of learning as they go or changing procedure to achieve a goal that is frequently a moving target.</p>
<p>The Asians I&rsquo;ve known are also knee-jerk Leftists, which represents a self-destructive impulse to embrace tyranny.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that they have no business in a White country. We don&rsquo;t need them. Their presence is, at the end of the day, destructive to Western Civilization.</p>
<p>And they really are bad drivers. It&rsquo;s a symptom of their inability to innovate or react to changing variables. The chaos of traffic paralyzes them or makes them overly aggressive. I&rsquo;ve seen them simply stop in the middle of an intersection because they can&rsquo;t react to an unexpected development. They are not as childishly aggressive as Blacks and Mexicans, but they are as dangerous.</p>
<p>I like a lot of Asians I&rsquo;ve known, but they are essentially cuckoos in the nest; rigid collectivists; supercharged Leftist SWPLs. They need to find someplace else to live. But I guess they&rsquo;ve ruined the countries that they come from.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-495238" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Easy for others to offer advice, but I&rsquo;ve watched Jared Taylor over many years and in that time his public presentations have gone from good to absolutely outstanding. As far as I know, Taylor is the most eloquent, forceful and attractive defender of Western civilization in the United states. My advice is to some of our other leaders. You too are my heroes, but you need to take a leaf from Jared&rsquo;s book and remember that, while there may be people born with natural speaking talents, public speaking, whether in-person, broadcast or streaming, involves a set of skills that, like landscape painting or building a fine home, need to be studied, practiced and mastered. Like so many things, public speaking is an art and a science. </p>
<p>This is also true of people coming from academia. In my previous incarnations, I have spent lots of time in classrooms, lecture halls and have viewed a number of streaming university lectures. I think, particularly today, when one of the worst crimes you can commit is to appear pretentious, that a lot of academic lecturing is given in the manner of a pleasant next-door neighbor talking to you over their white picket fence as they water their hydrangeas. Of course you don&rsquo;t need to be Calhoun or Webster in an academic setting, since students are pretty much required to listen, needing to take notes for test-taking and the like. However in real life you are competing with a hundred and one other distractions. That goes for all of us, including yours truly, that we have to remember that we are trying to save and renew Western civilization, not going over a course syllabus or just shooting the breeze. Jared Taylor seems to never have forgotten this-to our great luck.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-495239" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I agree with the gist of several comments below that it seems highly unlikely that electoral politics is the answer to our plight, but also completely agree with at least one commenter who wrote that it would help to get the pro-West movement off the ground to coalesce around a few candidates. I would think a good place to start would be a handful of congressional primaries. A candidate doesn&rsquo;t need to be shouting &#8216;White pride!&rsquo; but to just clearly make his (or her) case for Western civilization while pointing out the absurdities of things things like &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; and the extreme under-reporting of black-on-White violent crime. </p>
<p>Of course the media, when not ignoring such a candidate, will be trying to destroy him, one way being to &#8216;Expose!&rsquo; that candidate as having supporters like us. But here is the key: He does not run scared. Such a candidate simply states that he is very happy to have European American or White supporters and the support of others who agree with his common-sense positions. And then he uses that as an opportunity to launch another forceful but pleasant, with wit and style, salvo against Multicultural Marxism. </p>
<p>I believe that such a candidacy would not only educate people, network many more people to work on our side, but in some congressional districts would emerge victorious. Imagine the fun that could be had upsetting the apple cart with just one Jared Taylor-like member of congress strolling through the corridors of Capitol Hill as the Tolerance Police squeak and skitter about like frightening fat rats on a sinking ship.</p>

The population of Ethiopia tripled because of people like Sally Struthers and Geldof.  The US sent some $600 billion in 20 years to Ethiopia, from 1950~1970.  If the rich Whites Political Class didn&rsquo;t raise money for Ethiopia there would be less than 20 million people.  Now there&rsquo;s nearly 5 times that much, they&rsquo;re still poor, they&rsquo;re still starving and they&rsquo;re being shipped here.</p>
<p>There is no Africa without White aid.  Destroy the White/Jewish political class that steals white money for Africa and they starve, just like in America.</p>

<p>More post WW2 money was spent in Northern Africa than anywhere else, including America.  Peace Corps funneled money into &#8220;developing countries&#8221; as &#8220;missionaries of democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is you believe that &#8220;annual budget&#8221; is the same thing as lobbying for White tax money.  It&rsquo;s not.  That&rsquo;s part of the scheme.  The Red Cross may be a multi-billion dollar enterprise but they also lobby and direct tax money spent on Welfare and Aid.  Do you really think that Red Cross ONLY spends their own money?  Sorry but that&rsquo;s not happening.  They lobby for more money to buy supplies on behalf of non-Whites.  And $3 billion per year leaves a LOT of time to lobby.</p>

It is not enough to warn people of danger. An effective message must include a way out of the danger, otherwise the message will have uninteneded consequences. In this case, whites who view this video may think the situation is hopeless and thus, not worth knowing because they cannot do anything to change the outcome.<br/>
This phenomenon has been extensively studied (e.g. of smoking cessation). Researchers have found fear induction in advertising works best when it is paired with a solution. Then and only then, did researcher obtain the best results for inducing behavioural change. Every social psychologist already knows this. Why does Jared not know?<br/>
Think about it for a moment. Everybody who views these videos already is aware of the changing demographics in America. Everybody who views these videos already has some idea of what it means for them in terms of current and future socioeconomic and political status. So, how does the average viewer feel after viewing this video? Happy? No! More like depressed or angry and consequently, the veiwer does not want to know anymore.He cannot do anythng about it and thu it is not rewarding.  Now imagine Jared offered us a convenient everday solution that we could carry out that would help us in our predicament. The result would be twofold. It would give viewers  hope and in turn increase viewership. This would be beneficial to the cause.</p>

<p>While I agree Whites need to start planning, that is not what Jared should be bothered with.  Some of us are better planners, others are better messengers.  Some, like BUGsters, run genius marketing.  Does that mean we should blame BUGsters for not having a &#8220;plan&#8221;?  No.  They&rsquo;re marketing information.</p>
<p>Not everyone should be doing everything.  Nor should we expect them to.  Take what Jared offers and thank God he&rsquo;s here for us.  Look to others and do the same:<br/>
Kevin MacDonald<br/>
TheOccidentalObserver(dot)net<br/>
RadixJournal(dot)com<br/>
whitegenocideproject(dot)com</p>
<p>Use their information, spread the word.  If you can&rsquo;t lead then find someone who can.  If you can&rsquo;t organize others then find someone who can.  It starts with you.</p>

Let me break it down for you this way:<br/>
Scare messages may promote change.<br/>
Scare messages paired with a solution are more likely to promote greater, longer lasting change.<br/>
Thus, scare white people by telling them they are facing dispossesion and some may act to prevent it. Scare white people by telling them they are facing dispossession and tell them how they can act to prevent dispossession will result in more white people acting to prevent it.<br/>
I am not trying to condescend or criticize anybody, I am merely providing a perspective based on social scientific theory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scare messages paired with a solution are more likely to promote greater, longer lasting change.&#8221;</p>
<p>True, but Jared doesn&rsquo;t have a plan beyond micro-communities or shtetls.  Does that mean he should just come up with a bogus one for everybody?</p>
<p>The best plan I could come up with is something that looks like this:<br/>
#1 - White identity: Without a White Identity then all plans don&rsquo;t matter.  Our identity must be biological, political, historical, and religious (sacred).  The most important question for Whites should always be - is this good for Whites? &#8220;Our people are more important than your principles.&#8221;<br/>
#2 - Abandon Universalism for Tribalism: One people, many tribes.  When Whites see themselves as one people and many tribes then the morals change.  The primary result is we see ourselves as pan-nationalists and no more White Wars.  Our loyalty is to our tribes (Irish, English, Greek, et al) and our race (White).  The laws of nations therefore do not apply unless they benefit Whites.  Welfare?  If it takes from Whites more than it gives back it&rsquo;s evil.  So we plunder Welfare. Make sense?<br/>
#3 - Explicit White groups: churches, schools, communities, and cities.  With a White Identity and a community that has defenders (religious) then it&rsquo;s easier to mobilize beyond the law.  We don&rsquo;t sell homes or land to non-Whites.  We ruin anyone who does.  We don&rsquo;t need to advertise this either.  No symbols.  Without #1 &amp; #2 we can&rsquo;t get here.<br/>
#4 - Go Amish: Whites that live in explicit, ethnic communities like Amish and Hutterites are very successful at maintaining their identity and ethnicity.  The Amish began as around 200 people, many were elderly.  They&rsquo;ve had a steady growth of around 5% per year.  No one knows the actual number of Amish but there&rsquo;s anywhere from one-quarter to half-a-million.  Focus on &#8220;tradition&#8221; and it baffles the Libtards.</p>
<p>When searching for these groups our most important concern should be women.  Why?  A woman&rsquo;s intelligence rests on a high curve, meaning most women are average.  The &#8220;Founder Effect&#8221; is what needs to be considered.  Intelligent mothers have intelligent children.  More importantly, they will have the intelligence to challenge and teach them.  Women who understand money, highly ethno-centric, danger sense and have a strong memory are a must but they also have to be mentally tough.  Patriot groups will often have these types of women.</p>
<p>Groups form based on identity, a sense of belonging, which is why our race and ethnicity must become our identity. It&rsquo;s harder to find a stronger bond than family.  &#8220;Church&#8221; groups allow Whites to used non-tax status so their money go farther as they monitor loyalty, observe skills, maintain identity/history, and send leaders to work with other groups.  It will allow for schooling and training, not to mention job placement and coordinated plunder of the Welfare system.  Whites working together as they plunder the Welfare system could use it to by land and property for their &#8220;Church&#8221; and thus the People are the Religion.  A sacred right to exist.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-496794" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>At a minimum, get married off of the records, have lots of children, and have your wife file for Welfare as a single mother to plunder the Welfare system.  That&rsquo;s two massive incomes, filing separately and making lots of money doing it.  Help others do the same and pool money to form a militia.  Get in touch with military and ex-military to help you train.  Having 5 or 6 kids keeps you busy and focuses your attention while building a future.   Movie night should consist of Red Dawn (John Milius), Road Warrior, Excalibur (Boorman), and Spaghetti Westerns.</p>
<p>All of the adults, especially since the women are filing as single mothers, should take First Aid and Emergency Care training.  Men should attempt to take over local law enforcement.  Men who aren&rsquo;t in local law enforcement should focus on Fire, Code, and City Hall.  This will allow you to get access to geographic data and city data, not to mention criminal records.  Also, in a SHTF situation you a connection to everything.</p>
<p>Make your safety and survival your job and life.  Make that part of your community.  Stock up on freeze dried foods, water filters, and bullets.  Go on neighborhood walks and take others along. To relieve anxiety you should lead an &#8220;Amherst Writers and Artist&#8221; group (AWA), or group writing exercises.  I&rsquo;ve been running one every Thursday for the past 3 years.  It allows you to put your ideas and stories to paper, think on your feet, and share them with others.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve noticed, everything is group.  Don&rsquo;t think for one second sitting at home by yourself will fix this.  It won&rsquo;t.  You need to find others and form a brotherhood.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-496970" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I agree. One of the reasons that the white race is the superior race, if you will, is that as a race whites are productive, enterprising, ethical, moral, and more intelligent. Of course there are exceptions; our psycho politicians are one good example!  Atrocities have been committed by whites throughout history; we all know that. But largely, the white race controls its baser instincts and produces exceptionally civilized, thriving societies, contrary to other races. Obviously, I&rsquo;m a racist. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being racist. We need to recognize that fact and not care if we&rsquo;re labeled as such. Liberals use the word as a derogatory label, but it&rsquo;s really not. Fred Reed has recently written a good essay on the subject that I believe proves my point: A Laudable Racism, if  you&rsquo;re interested.</p>

<p>^^Fixed it for you.</p>
<p>You talk about &#8220;whites&#8221; then you bitch when our solution is to form explicit White groups for our protection and survival.  Sorry Charlie but you race is targeted for extermination.  If you want to survive as a White then you better find other Whites who want to survive as well.  Everyone wants you dead.  If Whites are &#8220;capable of more&#8221; then what the hell are you bitching about?  Why are you begging Jared Taylor for a &#8220;Plan&#8221; then just bitch some more?  You talk a big game of &#8220;creative&#8221; and &#8220;responsible&#8221; Whites but all I hear is bitching.  America&rsquo;s Founders were creative and responsible to themselves and one another, but they constantly broke the law.</p>
<p>Where are is your White network?  You think voting will fix this?  No White voted to be a hated minority.</p>
<p>Clive Bundy and some ranchers just told the Federal Government to stuff it.  There were nearly 200 barrels pointing at a family of ranchers.  Within a day there was a militia of around 800 people.  The Federal government pulled out.  If that were you I suspect you&rsquo;d just be bitching.</p>

<p>But I have found that most times, when someone complains about someone else only talking about problems and never offering solutions to the problems, what they&rsquo;re really complaining about is the someone else in question even talking about the particular problems to begin with.  In other words, they&rsquo;re complaint about &#8220;so-and-so never offers any solutions&#8221; is a back handed way to try to censor so-and-so from talking about the problem.</p>
<p>Besides, if the problem is simple enough and well understood enough, the solution(s) should be obvious and self-evident, even if not easy.</p>

<p>Go ahead and form your white groups full of militants and yahoos. Perhaps there will come a time and place that you will need them. I simply don&rsquo;t think this is the time or the place. This is a time for thinking, particularly in a positive fashion. Thus, I merely offered a general solution: Continue to communicate the bad, but pair it with something constructive to ensure future compliance to the cause. That&rsquo;s it. It was a suggestion and it was you and your negative thinking that turned it into &#8220;bitching&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you begging Jared Taylor for a &#8220;Plan?You talk a big game of &#8220;creative&#8221; and &#8220;responsible&#8221; Whites but all I hear is bitching&#8221;</p>
<p>Have you ever considered that you were wrong in the way you interpret the messages of other people? What motivates you to think the worst of me? </p>
<p>&#8220;Where are is your White network?  You think voting will fix this?   Whites did not vote to be a hated minority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who brought up voting? </p>
<p>&#8220;Clive Bundy and some ranchers just told the Federal Government to stuff it.  There were nearly 200 barrels pointing at a family of ranchers.  Within a day there was a militia of around 800 people.  The Federal government pulled out.  If that were you on the ranch in Nevada I suspect you&rsquo;d just be bitching to Jared for a plan.&#8221;<br/>
More fantasy on your part that is not relevant to my original thread.</p>

The variables and circumstances that caused ordinary citizens to rally against the government must be identified and reported to those who can best replicate the results in another region. Once successful, white organizers will have a useful tool at their disposal.</p>

In the Senate, Republicans voted for the bill 24 to 3. Democrats voted almost as strongly for the bill as the Republicans, so both parties share equally in the blame.</p>

We Whites need to get the ball rolling on Government secession in our remaining mostly white enclaves before it is too late. We need to separate Governmentally from the multicultural beast, so that we can close the doors to immigration in order to preserve our culture. The prospect of being part of the same country as everything below that line in the Southwest where the Mestizos have invaded should inspire fear in the hearts of minds of all American Whites. We need to separate our enclaves politically before it is too late. The Mestizo hordes are literally invading. It is them who will make us minorities in our own homeland that our forebears built.</p>

Even if you can&rsquo;t read more than street signs and landmarks, it won&rsquo;t take more than 1-2 trips to know the route and the rest of muscle memory and visual as auditory cued mechanical rhythms.<br/>
You go out, you get the food, you come back.<br/>
Similarly, if someone _tells_ the farmer that whether he gets to eat or keep breathing or see his wife and kids again depends on whether he plants and cares for and harvests X crop, he will.  Because the penalty is too high a buyin for rebellion.<br/>
What people have to understand is that white society is not being torn down by removing the skilled labor from the middle.  Because it is not -intended- to have a fully functional, distributed, economy where high competency and moral dedication to excellence in every area makes it worthwhile for all of us because we each _do our jobs_.<br/>
If that were the case, we would not have seen the engineered crises in farming, industry, office and now university level professions.<br/>
Rather, what is happening is something akin to setting up a society for remote rule from the top by a few, _very bright_ people with the rest operating in a kind of semi-ordered chaos of bureaucratic inefficiency which nonetheless, manages to get &#8216;enough done&rsquo; to keep the collective from starving.<br/>
And this is easy enough to set up when you are empowering one, penalizing another and forcing everyone into a backstabbing contest of incredible antagonistic self disablement.<br/>
Hitler did exactly this with his cronies, empowering all, just enough, to compete each other into nullification of their own productivity.<br/>
And it works because the proffered endgame is one of such glorious payoff as to make everyone want to /try/ on a &#8216;better than what they have now&rsquo; basis.  And once locked in, they are too busy deflecting knives from their own back and stabbing with their own to notice a greater agenda.<br/>
World Rule by a disengaged elite minority.<br/>
This is the evil that we are uplifting by failing to acknowledge that our racial interests are not those of homo sapiens as a whole but only those who are _really close_ to a speciation event which will forever take us beyond their reach or equality.<br/>
The Usual Suspects NEED us to continue to give a damn so that they can make their own bones and catch up in the race and so they play on our guilt, fear and almost religious hatred for &#8216;Nazi Socialism&rsquo; /any way they can/.<br/>
Including using the very same techniques.<br/>
When whites are gone, or too few to run the joint, we will be replaced in place by the idiocracy of the common lohing herd and the imported East Asian managerial class who don&rsquo;t mind lording it over any and all for the amount they are being paid.<br/>
Don&rsquo;t believe me?  Look at India.  Look at China.<br/>
Two of the most corrupt states on the planet where -no doubt-, tens of thousands die from inadequate surety of delivery on goods and services, every day.  But the gears keep grinding.  And enough live (or are born) to ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t break down completely.</p>

before. On the issue of the changing demographics of America, Europe and<br/>
Australia, Jared is preaching to the choir. Any independent thinking person not<br/>
unduly influenced by the religion of multiculturalism knows that a society consisting<br/>
of atomized groups of people belonging to different races is madness. A society<br/>
without a common racial heritage is doomed to fail. Why then is diversity and multiculturalism<br/>
being promoted in America and elsewhere? Why do otherwise intelligent and<br/>
educated people embrace the madness without asking any questions? Why do our<br/>
politicians, business men and women and our church leaders promote the<br/>
darkening of America, even though they know it will lead to the death of European<br/>
America? Well to some extent accepting multiculturalism has become very<br/>
fashionable, and today people would rather die than be unfashionable. To<br/>
criticize immigration means you are a hater and a bigot and even a racist, and today,<br/>
these are very unfashionable. The real threat to the continuation of America as<br/>
a European based society lies with the mass media of news and entertainment,<br/>
and I could write a book on the subject. It is the Jews who control the media<br/>
who are responsible for the catastrophic changes happening in America and<br/>
elsewhere. Through music, through movies and through the bias in news reporting<br/>
the Jews have shaped the mind and opinions of the people – black is good, white<br/>
is bad. When you control the mind of the people, you control the political<br/>
process and you OWN democracy. Just, recently we saw how GOP presidential candidates<br/>
were grovelling before a Jewish billionaire for financial support. The Jews<br/>
through their control of the mass media decide who will be president and what<br/>
that president will do while in office. To reverse what has happened in America<br/>
since 1965 would require the complete takeover of the mass media, but it is<br/>
unlikely that any republican or democrat president would pass the laws needed<br/>
to make a sick America well again. So America will get darker with each passing<br/>
year, and the mass media will tell you why it is good to see whites become a<br/>
minority in their own land. So forget about saving America through the<br/>
democratic process. It will not work!</p>

I live in South Africa and we are the victims of the same endless rhetoric. &#8220;Whites own everything in South Africa&#8221;, &#8220;Whites own all the land&#8221;, &#8220;Whites own all the big business&#8221;, &#8220;Whites own the media&#8221;, &#8220;Whites control the economy&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a sense it is true. The people who control the economy are mostly white, the people with the most wealth are white. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that ALL whites own everything. I don&rsquo;t even own a house. And I struggle to get by every month running a small business. And if the blacks come for me and my family, they won&rsquo;t take that into consideration when they rape my wife and torture my children because they have been brainwashed to believe that ALL whites are rich.</p>
<p>So, while it may be true that those who control the media are Jewish, it is not true that ALL Jews are somehow involved in this plot to brainwash the world. This is just naive. </p>
<p>I agree with most of the comments on amren, but I just can&rsquo;t get my head around this notion that somehow every Jew on the planet is secretly conspiring against the whites. I&rsquo;d say 99% of Jews (especially the ones in Israel) would agree with most of what is said on amren if everybody stopped this Antisemitism.</p>
<p>This is coming from a South African who knows that (even though there were SOME Communist Jews in the ANC), Israel was the Apartheid government&rsquo;s ONLY ally.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-499497" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Well Tabsa there are several facts you really need to understand.<br/>
First I am not an anti-Semite. Some of my best friends and professional colleagues are Arabs or of Arabic descent. When it comes to murdering and torturing Semites and forcing them to leave their homes at gun point no group of people are better at it than the Jews in Israel. To see how these same Jews have treated the USA over the last 50 years I suggest that you google – Lavon Affair, USS Liberty and the Pollard Affair, and these will provide a good starting point on Jewish Racism and Supremacism. The Jews control the mass media and those who control<br/>
the media, control the thoughts and opinions of the people, and it is no<br/>
coincidence that Jews and only Jews are dominant in the area of information dissemination.</p>
<p>And yes you are right that not all Jews are involved in the brain washing of America, but Jews and only Jews are intimately involved nonetheless. There are Jews like Israel Shahak and Norman Finkelstein who have<br/>
written books on Jewish lies, Jewish manipulation of the media, Jewish racism and Jewish supremacism and I suggest that you read their books. Norman Finklestein has been banned from visiting Israel for 15 years because of his comments about the so-called holocaust.</p>
<p>A discussion about good jews and bad jews is just as irrelevant as a discussion about good blacks and bad blacks or good hispanics and<br/>
bad hispanics. In the United States, and in Canada, and in Europe and in South Africa we whites are involved in a racial war. A war that will decide who controls our country – a country that our ancestors founded, developed and died defending. When an enemy approaches you with a gun drawn you care not about his political opinions or the fact that he may have been a conscious objector to the war. He is approaching you with the intent to kill you, and that is all that matters. When we look at those lands in which blacks are the numerical majority as is the case of South Africa and Rhodesia, we see countries in financial chaos, social<br/>
disorder and civil unrest. Your own country of South Africa is only two decades away from becoming another Haiti. So to conclude I am white, I am of European descent and I will fight for my people – white people, and as long as the Jews who control the media promote diversity and multiculturism, and while Jews murder and torture Semites in Palestine I will always be in conflict with Jews.</p>

No sensible person would ever argue that ALL Jews are behind some secret conspiracy to destroy western civilization. Not ALL Jews are anti-western and anti-white, in the same way that not ALL negroes have IQs below 85. Some Jews can be pro-white and pro-western. It&rsquo;s all about the law of statistical averages.  As a group, Jews tend to fight for their own ethnic genetic interests, even if these result in the social and political disintegration of the host society. Jews also tend to be disproportionately overrepresented among advocates of supposedly &#8220;progressive&#8221;, nation-wrecking causes (such as massive 3rd world immigration). &#8220;Antisemitism&#8221;, like &#8220;negrophobia&#8221;, is an entirely rational prejudice. It exists because Jews, as a group, engage in certain behaviors that are detrimental to the ethnic genetic interests of others, especially whites.</p>

<p>I admit that I don&rsquo;t know enough about the Jews&rsquo; history and involvement in the media in the US to really comment on it, but it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. Just like I can&rsquo;t get my head around the fact that whoever controls the world and America is trying to destroy the very fabric of Western civilization. What is in it for them?</p>
<p>Same goes for the Jews. Surely you need to have some kind of motive for the crime. What will they gain from destroying Western civilization? For that matter, what will the rich and powerful gain from an illiterate, mixed breed populace with no motivation or skills?</p>
<p>At least we know what the motive behind Jihad and the Islamization of Europe is. The Muslims want to create a world-wide Islamic caliphate. But what is the motive behind the white Europeans in power who are allowing this to happen? To stay in power? Because, just like the National Party in South Africa eventually had to give up their high paying jobs to black Marxists, the European politicians will lose power and wealth once the Muslims take over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read Jared Taylor&rsquo;s White Identity and know a bit more about the racial tension in America between whites, blacks and hispanics now. So I understand the motive behind the blacks and hispanics&rsquo; behavior. But what is the motive behind the white politicians in the US, who are allowing the breakdown of Western civilization in their own country?</p>
<p>It seems to me like our enemy is within our own race. Just like it was with South Africa. The Apartheid government had their foot on the ANC&rsquo;s neck. They were a useless bunch of terrorists and by the end of the 80&rsquo;s, they were reduced to an insignificant mob of spongers. But the powers that be handed South Africa over to them on a silver platter. I was too young when this happened to know what was going on. But I&rsquo;m old enough to see how things have gone to sh!t here. And I know that the motive behind the handover of power had nothing to do with &#8216;human rights&rsquo;. It was about money, power, gold and diamonds. It seems like it is in the interest of the West to destroy a country like South Africa (or Iraq, Egypt, Syria etc&hellip;) for material gain.</p>
<p>But what can the motive possibly be for the powers in the West to knowingly destroy their own countries? And what part would the Jews play in this destruction and what will they gain from it? If only they could have the decency to make their plans public like the Muslims, at least we&rsquo;ll know what our enemy&rsquo;s intentions are.</p>

<p>Let me answer your questions:</p>
<p>The rich and powerful promote universal egalitarianism, massive 3rd world immigration and multiculturalism because they benefit enormously from these policies, especially in terms of increased wealth and power. More warm bodies means downward pressure on wages for both unskilled and professional work. This enables the corporations to maximize their ability to accumulate profit. More warm bodies also means more people buying real estate, opening up bank accounts, and purchasing consumer goods in stores. Politicians love diversity because more squabbling  ethnicities makes them less accountable to the electorate, allowing them to become increasingly powerful and authoritarian.</p>
<p>Jews advocate universal egalitarianism, massive 3rd world immigration and multiculturalism for western white-majority nations (and only western white-majority nations) for the same reasons as western elites, but with a twist. They dislike culturally and ethnically homogeneous white-majority societies because they fear that such societies may turn on them, which is exactly what happened in Germany between 1933-1945. It&rsquo;s really about promoting Jewish survival at the expense of whites. Please read <i>The Culture of Critique</i>.</p>

<p>I know first hand what cheap labor does to a country. I started out working in the UK when I was 17, ended up in the construction industry. In 2004, I was earning £100 a day for unskilled labor, which was so much money that I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it all at the time. In the years that I spent there, I met a lot of Polish people. Befriended a lot of them. These guys had to get into the UK on student visas and were forced to learn English, so they integrated with everybody.</p>
<p>I came back to SA in 2005 and stayed here for about 8 months. In the meantime, the British borders were opened to the Polish. When I went back, I got a similar job again, but the going rate was all of a sudden £50 a day. The company I worked for had about 20 employees and my South African friend and I were the only ones who could speak English. We had to learn a bit of Polish. These guys had no intention of learning English and they were living together in little &#8216;Polish enclaves&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kept in contact with some of the English guys I used to work with in London and they&rsquo;re all complaining because they have to compete with Eastern Europeans who work for half of what they used to get.</p>
<p>And then of course, I&rsquo;ve been running my own business in South Africa for years and this country was built on cheap labor. We all know what happened here.</p>
<p>So are these people in power so bloody daft that they can&rsquo;t learn from other people&rsquo;s mistakes? </p>
<p>The Chinese bought up mines in Zimbabwe because they are seen as &#8216;natives&rsquo; by mad old Bob. They are also classified as &#8216;black&rsquo; in South Africa for Black Economic Empowerment and AA purposes. Anyway, the Chinese recently sacked something like 2000 miners because they were striking for better wages. They were earning $200 per month. Meanwhile, just South of the border, close to 100 000 platinum miners have been on strike since January, demanding an entry level salary of $1250 per month. Rustenburg, the capital of the platinum belt is on the brink of disaster as businesses are closing down. If you try to go to work, the striking savages will kill you, so it&rsquo;s all shut down.</p>
<p>South Africa produces 78% of platinum worldwide. JP Morgan warned that there will be a shortage of platinum until 2017. So what does that mean? Supply and demand. Create the illusion of scarcity and the price goes up. Are these platinum mines in on the strikes? They don&rsquo;t have to pay these striking mine workers for 5 or 6 months. In the end, they give into their demands and they haven&rsquo;t lost a penny, but the price of platinum has sky-rocketed&hellip; and they&rsquo;ve got reserves.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve gone WAY off the subject. In the end it&rsquo;s all about GREED. More, more, more&hellip; Isn&rsquo;t McDonalds making enough money? No, they&rsquo;ve got to close the first window at the drive-through and give the poor idiot at the second window a headset so that he/she has to do two people&rsquo;s jobs, so the shareholders can get MORE money. When is enough going to be enough?</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. It made me think. And I&rsquo;m like a sponge on this website. That&rsquo;s exactly why I like amren as opposed to all the brainless neo-nazi websites out there. Because you can actually learn something here.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-499918" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What you need to understand is this problem with Whites goes back to ancient Greece.  The democracy brought about the madness of &#8220;individualism&#8221; and &#8220;universalism&#8221; where the power hungry discovered they could make foreigners &#8220;citizens&#8221; and get votes in return at the expense of their nation and tribe.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Culture of Critique the motive is VERY different, though it looks the same.</p>
<p>In 2008, Postville Iowa had the LARGEST illegal immigration raid in US History.  It was a Kosher food manufacturer owned by Orthodox Jews.  Go ahead and do a Google Search.  You&rsquo;ll find the New York Times &#8220;shaming&#8221; ICE.  You&rsquo;ll find videos of Jewish organizations fighting against their deportation and smearing the opposition as &#8220;racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cooking the books, gaming the system, and smearing their Host nation is their religion.  Don&rsquo;t take my word for it.  Just search for Orthodox Jewish Riots in Israel.  Orthodox Rabbis have said &#8220;it&rsquo;s better to convert to Islam than to fight for Israel.  It&rsquo;s better to serve God than government.&#8221;  You&rsquo;ll discover that Israel has a Jewish problem, as funny as that sounds.  The Orthodox game the system, riot, cheat their taxes, refuse to serve in the IDF, and drain welfare as they refuse all work that is not academic or mercantile. What&rsquo;s important to note is they&rsquo;re only a fundamentalist version of Judaism like the Amish are of White Christians.  Jews are closer to Muslims than they are to any European identity. </p>

Italians, especially Sicilians, are European to the core, genetically and culturally. Italians used to keep Negroids out of their neighborhoods entirely, and are not big fans of the Mestizo influx either. Italian Americans are one of the most racial realist European Nationality groups in America. The old joke, &#8220;I&rsquo;m FBI, Full Blooded Italian!!&#8221; is a statement of European ethnic pride that one can still hear from many an Italian American.<br/>
I&rsquo;ve encountered this &#8220;Italians are not White&#8221; drivel before a couple of times on AmRen. This stuff is both foolish and ignorant. With Mestizos flowing across our border and threatening to swamp us in tandem with the Bantu-In-Chief doing everything he can to transfer wealth from us European Americans to the Negroids, that last thing we need to be doing is insulting the heritage of one of Europe&rsquo;s most proud, and intensely racial realist nationalities.</p>

<p>Totally agree. </p>
<p>Having lived in Italy, Rome to be exact, I can say that full-blooded Italians are European to the core! In fact, many of the best European minds have been Italian. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are &#8220;Italians&#8221; who are obviously of mixed-racial ancestry, looking more North African than European, yet they are Italians.</p>
<p>But I suppose at this juncture in history, that can be said of any European country or what&rsquo;s left of them. </p>
<p>No insult intended.</p>
