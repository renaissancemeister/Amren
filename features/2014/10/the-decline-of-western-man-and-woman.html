<div class="intro-paragraph">
A conversation with F. Roger Devlin.</div> 
</div> 



<p>I would be very much surprised if there is a single reader of this interview who is unfamiliar with the writing of F. Roger Devlin. In addition to his frequent attendance at the kind of gatherings the <a href="http://www.thesocialcontract.com/answering_our_critics/southern_poverty_law_center_splc_info.html">SPLC</a> reports on, his frequent book reviews and occasional essays have been carried by nearly every corner of the web that makes up the unauthorized right, and that has been the case for over a decade now.</p>
<p>Although generally very private, Dr. Devlin tells us that he is from Baltimore, and received his PhD in Political Philosophy from Tulane University. For those of you interested in familiarizing yourselves with the man and his work a bit more before reading on, I recommend his most famous essay <a href="../../../archives/v6n2/DevlinTOQV6N2.pdf"><em>Sexual Utopia in Power</em></a>, along with his two more personal essays: <em>Why I Write</em> and <a href="../../../archives/v6n4/DevlinV6N47x10.pdf"><em>The Academy: Reform or Secession</em></a>. Below, Dr. Devlin shares his thoughts on literature, the late Sam Francis, economics, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>What does the &ldquo;F&rdquo; in your name stand for?</strong></p>
<p>Francis. I include it in my signature to distinguish myself from other Roger Devlins who may be out there. Once I was bemused to find myself referred to as <em>Father</em> Devlin.</p>
<p><strong>Independent writers are invariably urged to create an Internet personality by maintaining a personal blog, or at least a presence on Twitter or Facebook. You have done none of this. Why not?</strong></p>
<p>I prefer the discipline of writing longer pieces. We live in an attention deficit society already, and I don&rsquo;t care to exacerbate the situation. These websites, moreover, are already being used as a form of social control. Remember <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/justine-sacco-fired-tweet-aids-africa-issues-apology/story?id=21301833">Justine Sacco</a>?</p>
<p><strong>You have made your reasons for leaving <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/higher-education-the-impossibility-of-reform">the academy</a> clear, and it is hard to disagree, but it is still quite impressive to put those critiques into action and just walk away. What advice do you have for those considering doing the same?</strong></p>
<p>My own reasons were partly personal, and not necessarily a model for others to follow. I was encouraged by the examples of men like Russell Kirk and John Attarian. But I can&rsquo;t recommend it as a career for men with large families to support.</p>
<p>Eventually we are going to have to create our own institutions, both schools and think tanks, for dissident scholars. Right now we do not even have the infrastructure for hiring full-time activists, as other ethnic groups do.</p>
<p><strong>Do you value the writing and research skills gained from your time in college enough not to regret having attended, or do you wish you had never even bothered?</strong></p>
<p>I use my education every day. In fact, I consider my main &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; to be educating myself about the world around me, and my writing as a byproduct of that effort. Yet long years of schooling are no guarantee of anything. I am frequently disappointed in the shallowness and conventionality of academics&rsquo; political views.</p>
<p>Young people should not go to college without a clear idea of what it is they hope to accomplish. Humanities departments, especially, are utterly corrupt. For many, it would make more sense simply to acquire an un-outsourceable skill through apprenticeship. Those who cannot advance without a credential may consider pursuing a cheap distance-learning degree while getting their real education elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>I understand you lived as an expatriate in Europe for a time. Can you explain a little about how you made this decision, and why you returned? Would you recommend that more whites &#8220;return to the homeland&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p>I did some of my graduate study in Germany. Afterwards, I stayed in Europe to write my doctoral dissertation while teaching English. Such an experience can be valuable, but not unless you are prepared for it by learning languages and history. A sound education without time abroad is better than time abroad without a sound education.</p>
<p><strong>How did you discover AR?</strong></p>
<p>Back in 1999, the Council of Conservative Citizens offered Sam Francis&rsquo;s <em>Revolution From the Middle</em> as a premium for joining. I joined and attended the national conference that year, where I heard Jared Taylor speak. So I began looking at the magazine on the web. I remember being impressed by Glayde Whitney&rsquo;s article &ldquo;<a href="../../../archives/back-issues/october-1999.html#cover">The Biological Reality of Race</a>.&rdquo; I was used to empty academic blather about race, and it was something new to come upon an article written in a matter-of-fact tone by someone who actually knew what he was talking about. I still had a lot to learn, then; my own first contribution to the magazine came only in June, 2008. [<a href="/ar/2008/06/index.html#cover">See here</a>]</p>
<p><strong>I understand you knew Sam Francis personally before he died, and by all accounts he was quite a man. Unlike so many who knew him, you have written little about him; could you share a few of your memories of him?</strong></p>
<p>I started reading Sam&rsquo;s columns in <em>Chronicles</em> in 1997, and almost always learned something new. Later, I attended meetings of the CofCC National Capital Region chapter over which he presided. He was distrustful at first, because I tend to be quiet in company. One night I held forth more than usual, and before the next meeting I got a call saying Sam had specifically asked if I could come. So then I got rather less shy with him. We met for lunch one-on-one a couple times in 2003. He introduced me to Wilmot Robertson and racialist literature of a sort unmentioned in his <em>Chronicles</em> pieces. He was a blunt man who cared nothing for &ldquo;the structure of prevailing taboos&rdquo; (as Buckley termed it). Like myself, he was an academic <em>manqué</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Setting aside adapted speeches, most of your writing consists of book reviews. With only <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2014/09/the-question-of-female-masochism/">one exception</a>, you have not written a stand-alone essay in about five years, which is unusual for writers. Are you simply more inclined to analyze and reflect than advocate?</strong></p>
<p>That is probably true. Partly it is my background in philosophy, which makes me like to pick apart arguments, discover concealed premises, etc. Moreover, I get plenty of my own thoughts and ideas across in this most modest of literary genres, and there is a constant demand for reviews.</p>
<p><strong>While your reviews of non-fiction can be easily categorized into various genres (e.g. immigration, <em>Nouvelle Droite</em>, education), the same cannot be said of your considerably less frequent fiction reviews. Along with the reasonably well-known <a href="../../../archives/v8n1/TOQv8n1Devlin.pdf">Solzhenitsyn</a>, you have <a href="../../../MA/50_02/devlin.pdf">expressed admiration</a> for the so-called <em>Biedermeier</em> writers of 19th century Germany, an affinity for ancient Greek plays, and enjoyment of one self-published contemporary collection of short stories. Could you tell us some more about what fiction you read?</strong></p>
<p>The realistic novel is my favorite form. Favorite authors include Austen, Scott, Stendhal, Goethe, Stifter and the Russian realists. Classical Greek literature in all genres is the essential basis for everything that follows. Yet there are still embarrassing gaps in my knowledge of literature, including virtually the whole contemporary scene.</p>
<p><strong>You almost always refrain from comment on contemporary American politics, and even review few books related to the matter (an <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/jan-brewer-on-arizona-s-agony-but-not-what-s-behind-it">interesting exception</a> being Jan Brewer&rsquo;s book, <em>Scorpions for Breakfast</em>); why? Do you read the news and try and keep up-to-date on what is happening, or have you completely checked out?</strong></p>
<p>I am as far as possible from any lack of interest in politics, but I take a long term view of events in which particular electoral contests shrink to near-insignificance. The liberal system will not be defeated by electing substantial numbers of dissidents to high office; there is truth in the old radical slogan that if elections could change anything, they would be illegal. The liberal system will collapse of its own weight: debt, over-centralization, anti-natalism, all the perverse incentives it creates. As our old sources of national strength quietly dry up, the regime is distracted with exotic trivia like gay marriage and the search for new forms of discrimination to combat. Competition from China alone is going to put an end to this ideological navel-gazing in the not-too-distant future. We must position ourselves to present the public with a credible alternative when the crisis hits. This is my focus, not the shadow-boxing of Republicans <em>vs</em>. Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>Your writing has influenced an incredible number of people across the spectrum of the unauthorized right. Your name has been explicitly championed by masculists like <a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2008/07/23/decivilizing-human-nature-unleashed/">Heartiste</a>, neoreactionaries like <a href="http://www.aimlessgromar.com/about">Aimless Gromar</a>, and ethno-nationalists like <a href="https://chechar.wordpress.com/category/roger-devlin/">Chechar</a>. One can also detect &ldquo;Devlinisms&rdquo; in the writings of other regular dissidents, like <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2014/4/3/marriage-is-dead-long-live-marriage">Gregory Hood</a> and <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2014/5/25/rape-culture-isnt-about-sex-its-about-power">Jack Donovan</a>. There is even a blog now dedicated to putting all of your work in one place: <a href="http://devliniana.wordpress.com/">Devliniana</a>. What do you attribute this very broad appeal and impact to?</strong></p>
<p>Political labels are context-dependent. In the context of feminism, I am a masculist; in that of hyper-modernity I am a reactionary; in that of anti-racism, I am a racialist. Fifty years ago, I might have been a Goldwater conservative, but the worsening situation, along with the cowardice and short-sightedness of Conservatism, Inc. have transformed me (somewhat against my own natural inclinations) into a kind of radical. This doesn&rsquo;t mean there is anything self-contradictory in my views.</p>
<p><strong>What ten books would you consider essential for right-wing dissidents?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Race, Evolution and Behavior</em> by J. Philippe Rushton, 2<sup>nd</sup> abridged edition.</li>
<li><em>The Dispossessed Majority</em> by Wilmot Robertson.</li>
<li><em>Taken Into Custody</em> by Stephen Baskerville.</li>
<li><em>The Closing of the Muslim Mind</em> by Robert R. Reilly.</li>
<li><em>The Solzhenitsyn Reader</em>, ed. by Ericson and Mahoney.</li>
<li><em>Economics in One Lesson</em> by Henry Hazlitt.</li>
<li><em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> by Edmund Burke.</li>
<li>Anything and everything by Samuel Francis.</li>
<li>Anything and everything by Jared Taylor.</li>
<li>Anything and everything by Kevin MacDonald.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>I understand that you have a new a book coming out with <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/category/counter-currents-title/"><em>Counter Currents Publishing</em></a>. Could you tell us a little about it?</strong></p>
<p>It is simply a collection of my essays to date on &ldquo;hypergamy and the female revolt against civilization,&rdquo; as the subtitle puts it, along with a Preface, Introduction and Postscript. Some of the essays are lightly revised.</p>
<p><strong>By far your most famous piece of work is <a href="../../../archives/v6n2/DevlinTOQV6N2.pdf"><em>Sexual Utopia in Power</em></a></strong><strong>, which has even been <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/08/why-the-falling.html">noticed</a></strong><strong> by the mainstream</strong><strong>. Would you have ever guessed that this would be your defining essay, and why do you think that has proved to be the case? If you could change anything in it now, would you?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it is my most important essay. I meditated on it for years before writing it down, and the intention was to make points that I did not see anyone else making. The response has been gratifying.</p>
<p><strong>Given the popularity, and obvious influence, of your writings on what can be loosely called &ldquo;socio-sexual dynamics,&rdquo; I would like to ask a few specific questions pertaining to this area of your work. The first four questions come from my sometime collaborator, <a href="http://www.socialmatter.net/author/hadleybishop/">Hadley Bishop</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One of the first elements which trips up readers coming from a more study/data-minded approach is that socio-sexual dynamics is very methodologically fuzzy. It seems you have hit on some important things in your writings, but your citations are sparse. How did you arrive at them, and could your method be used more widely?</strong></p>
<p>My writings are essays, not peer-reviewed research papers. Canadian scholar Barry Cooper says this about the essay form: &ldquo;An essay presents a point of view, not new information. It pushes investigation and argument to an extreme, and it does so in a mood of great confidence. The usual scholarly paraphernalia can be minimized, subtle qualifications and second thoughts can be dispensed with.&rdquo; The reason I used this imperfect form is that I had too much to say to fit into any other. Testing all my assertions with double-blind experiments and control groups would be the work of several lifetimes.</p>
<p>No, I do not possess any transferable method. I got my data by slumming around the Internet on chat forums and pick-up sites, interpreting it with the help of simple evolutionary psychology. The result was eventually a new model of sexual dynamics that accounts for wives being responsible for 90 percent of divorces, epidemic bachelorhood, bad boys with harems, death-row inmates besieged with female fan mail, unprecedented female freedom matched by unprecedented female frustration with men, etc. None of this can be explained if you imagine that women are morally superior natural monogamists to whom ardent swains must prove their worthiness, however edifying such a vision may have been to our grandfathers.</p>
<p><strong>How would you demonstrate (apart from citing observation and common sense) that females have less agency than males-that they are irrational, immature, irresponsible, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one for the neurologists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this, however: Women can be made more responsible by being<em> held</em> responsible. Men do not like to do this, because being a man means taking responsibility. Men will even try to blame themselves for their wives&rsquo; unfaithfulness, and wives are happy to let them. You get from women only as much virtue as you demand, so demand a lot.</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s a fairly strong <a href="http://takimag.com/article/the_barren_wombs_of_smart_women_jim_goad/print#axzz3DifWjqn9">correlation between high IQ and lower fertility rates</a>. What&rsquo;s the mechanism behind this? Is it that high IQers tend to be concentrated in cities with higher property rates, making it economically more difficult to reproduce? Is it that high IQers tend to adhere to the zeitgeist, that is, a feminist conception of gender relations?</strong></p>
<p>Both of these are factors, but it may be more important that only intelligent people are forward-looking enough to use birth control.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomy guaranteed through economic wellbeing seems to facilitate short-sightedness in average people, in that they discard familial relations and the desire for children, both of which are good for them in the long run. Given that prosperous material conditions are a key influence here, would you just wait out the ruinous economic cycle of collapsing fertility rates until it becomes rational to have children again, or is there anything else to be done in the interim?</strong></p>
<p>Our current way of life is obviously unsustainable and, as you point out, it will inevitably become rational to have children again at some future date-but this may happen only after a collapse unlike anything seen since the fall of Rome. By that time, European man may be too small a fraction of humanity for his civilization ever to recover. Those whites who buck the trend and have children today may prove the decisive factor in our survival.</p>
<p><strong>What do you make of today&rsquo;s &ldquo;hook-up culture,&rdquo; &ldquo;pick-up artistry&rdquo; and the like? In light of your view that marriage no longer holds any incentives for men, it would seem that contemporary men&rsquo;s obsession with &ldquo;scoring&rdquo; is merely a rational use of their energies. Do you agree?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, yes. Preaching morality to men is a waste of time. The laws must be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Interestingly, Gregory Hood seems to view game as a kind of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2014/06/the-sexual-counter-revolution/">sexual counter revolution</a>&rdquo;-while still others in our circles think of it as <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2012/06/pick-up-artists/">more or less the exact opposite</a>. What do you think?</strong></p>
<p>Women wish to optimize the mating market for themselves at the expense of men (cf. Jack Donovan&rsquo;s <em>The Way of Men</em> on bonobos vs. chimps). &ldquo;Game&rdquo; works against this female (and feminist) tendency. For this reason, women invariably hate and denounce it. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter; it only matters how they <em>respond</em> to game techniques.</p>
<p>Game can even be useful in finding a permanent mate, though it is not inherently directed to this end. But it is no substitute for restoring the legal basis of marriage. Game helps men only at the individual level, while perverse incentives affect the entire society.</p>
<p><strong>Aside from learning an Eastern European language (as you once suggested), what would you recommend these young men do instead of pursuing such passing fancies?</strong></p>
<p>Focus on being the best man you can be, not on what women think of you. Do not get serious about any girl unwilling to accept your direction, or who does not have sound principles and a long-term way of thinking. &ldquo;<a href="http://www.doclove.com/">Doc Love</a>&rdquo; is my favorite dating coach.</p>
<p><strong>One suggestion you have made for improving the current state of sex relations is a &ldquo;male strike&rdquo; of sorts, in regards to both marriage and coitus. You mention that such a strike &ldquo;was probably beyond the imagination even of Aristophanes&rdquo; (in reference to his <em>Lysistrata</em>), and I am curious how you envision such a strike. There is a theme of &ldquo;masculinist celibacy&rdquo; sprinkled here and there in Western literature, e.g., the proud &ldquo;man&rsquo;s man&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolytus_(play)"><em>Hippolytus</em></a>, or the antiheroes in hardboiled fiction who view women as fiendish distractions from their truth-seeking goals-or even just the male-only world of <em>Moby Dick</em> and many war and adventure novels. Should any of these be considered models, or is your vision more along the lines of a <a href="http://www.ancient-literature.com/greece_aristophanes_lysistrata.html"><em>Lysistrata</em></a> in reverse, almost akin to the strike taken by the productive class in Ayn Rand&rsquo;s <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>?</strong></p>
<p>I must acknowledge that a male sex strike is a rather fanciful notion. Someone has pointed out that even if you could get 90 percent of men to go along with it, the 10 percent without self-control would easily keep up the supply.</p>
<p>Still, something analogous to a sex-strike works at the individual level. As long as you are dependent on sex, you are dependent on women. This is disastrous: In a healthy relationship, the woman is dependent on the man. Women are attracted to men whom they sense do not <em>need</em> them. Master your sex instinct, be more aloof in the company of women and see if your interactions with them do not improve.</p>
<p><strong>Socio-sexual dynamics and education are the two topics that you often address directly, while most everything else receives treatment by way of book reviews, which leaves readers without a clear picture of your opinions on a number of different issues.</strong><strong> For example,</strong><strong> how do you feel about libertarianism generally, and free-market ideas specifically? In your writings, one can find pro-market critiques of the welfare state and protectionism (along with positive mentions of Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises), but there are also critiques of economism, a yearning for a more local economy, and sympathetic allusions to agrarianism and distributism. Furthermore, you have written for some publications that are quite libertarian (<em>The Last Ditch</em>), others that are fairly hostile to the ideology (<em>Counter Currents</em>), and others still that have a near schizophrenic variety of takes on it (<em>American Renaissance</em>).</strong></p>
<p>There is an economic aspect to everything men undertake, and some acquaintance with economic principles is indispensable for anyone concerned with socio-political issues. This is why I have included Hazlitt&rsquo;s little primer in my list of basic titles for the dissident. It will not make the reader an economist, but will make clear the roots of much fallacious economic thinking (even though Hazlitt&rsquo;s examples are dated) and the difficulty of considering the economic good of society as a whole rather than of particular sectors whose interests are often opposed to those of others.</p>
<p>Economics is a science of means, of directing available means fairly and rationally to human ends, <em>every one of which is non-economic</em>. Economics thus cannot provide a sufficient basis for ordering human life as a whole. Economism is the fallacy of trying to make it do so, of confusing the economic good with the human good <em>per se</em>. Wilhelm Röpke got it right when he called for &ldquo;a society with a market, but not a market society&rdquo; in which economic relations swallow up everything else. He described economism as &ldquo;a disorder of spiritual perception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greg Johnson&rsquo;s summation of Ron Paul&rsquo;s program was perfectly apt: Paul wants to ensure that the little brown people who are taking our country from us will enjoy the benefits of a hard currency. This is the sort of confused priorities that come from having a narrowly economic view of the social good. Contrast Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s view (quoting from memory) that &ldquo;the economy is not the nation, and when what is good for the economy differs from what is good for the nation, the nation comes first.&rdquo; My own ideal society would subordinate the economy to the good of the family as well as the nation, but this would still allow high productivity and incomparably greater economic freedom than we currently enjoy in America, especially for small businesses.</p>
<p><strong>In the same vein, I&rsquo;m curious to know what system of governance you see as most desirable: monarchy, limited republicanism, aristocracy?</strong></p>
<p>There is no universally best political regime. In some ways, we could even use more democracy today; e.g., the general public has never favored mass immigration. Yet we also need a reaffirmation of traditional aristocratic virtues and a sense of natural hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>You seem to straddle the line regarding the Jewish Question. Generally speaking, do you see Jews as friends or foes in the quest for white identity and survival? And what do you make of Kevin MacDonald&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/books.htm">Jewish trilogy</a>?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>I have read Dr. MacDonald&rsquo;s trilogy from beginning to end twice, parts of it more often. I think the interpretation of &ldquo;cultures&rdquo; as group evolutionary strategies will prove a crucial insight. Viewed <em>sub specie aeternitatis</em>, Dr. MacDonald&rsquo;s interpretation of Jewish-Gentile conflict has a tragic quality to it: Conflict is not due to any misunderstanding which might be corrected, but to the intrinsic nature of the two peoples. Of course, in politics we do not have the luxury of viewing conflict <em>sub specie aeternitatis</em>, and we must do what is best for our own people. This has nothing to do with harboring negative <em>feelings</em> toward Jews or anyone else, but only with perceiving our ethnopolitical situation accurately in order to act upon it rationally. I work with dissident Jews who are willing to work with me, but I do not foresee any time when the perceived self-interest of organized Jewry coincides with White self-interest.</p>
<p><strong>Outside of <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2013/11/on-wilmot-robertson/">briefly mentioning</a> Wilmot Robertson&rsquo;s <em>The Ethnostate</em> in a positive light, you seem to have never grappled with the idea of a white ethnostate somewhere in North America. What do you think?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in favor of it. The whole racial problem comes of having to share territory with enemies and parasites. Anti-white sentiment is merely an &ldquo;ideological superstructure&rdquo; resting on the &ldquo;material base&rdquo; of shared territory: Remove the base and the ideology will vanish overnight.</p>
<p><strong>At the risk of condemning you to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Socrates">the fate of Socrates</a>, do you have any advice for the youth?</strong></p>
<p>I am not against political activism by the young, but your primary focus in youth should be on educating yourself. Read the classics, not the bestsellers. Be open to learning from a broad variety of sources, but do not buy into any big ideology or world-view uncritically.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-633644" class="dsq-comment-message"><p><i>I prefer the discipline of writing longer pieces. We live in an attention deficit society already, and I don&rsquo;t care to exacerbate the situation.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guilty as charged. I hope that is not a crime that draws the death penalty.</p>
<p><i>Eventually we are going to have to create our own institutions, both schools and think tanks, for dissident scholars. Right now we do not even have the infrastructure for hiring full-time activists, as other ethnic groups do.</i></p>
<p>Most causes and ideologies that are &#8220;successful&#8221; are successful in that they appeal to groups of people that already have money or power or are gaining money or power, for some other reason. Our cause will get more successful if people with money and power think that our cause helps them attain and retain money and power, or attach itself to a mass audience of people.</p>
<p><i>Back in 1999, the Council of Conservative Citizens offered Sam Francis&rsquo;s Revolution From the Middle as a premium for joining.</i></p>
<p>Sam Francis wrote weekly columns, but his forte was the long form essay. He needed the freedom of a relatively long word count to develop ideas. That book and his essays in &#8220;Chronicles&#8221; are what you should read if you want to get into Sam Francis. Personally, I think his velvet gloved sarcasm, while present in his columns, was even better in his essay.</p>
<p><i>I am as far as possible from any lack of interest in politics, but I take a long term view of events in which particular electoral contests shrink to near-insignificance.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a political junkie, so much so that I have been accused of being Michael Barone&rsquo;s illegitimate son, the joke having a bit of pseudo-truth as he and my mother were born in the same year. But Devlin is right: I&rsquo;m a junkie of a drug that is about to run out, and IMHO, and probably in Devlin&rsquo;s opinion, too, the sooner the better.</p>
<p><i>The liberal system will collapse of its own weight: debt, over-centralization, anti-natalism, all the perverse incentives it creates.</i></p>
<p>Agreed, and it will fall apart in either one of two ways: Dissolution or right wing populist-nationalist despotism.</p>
<p><i>As our old sources of national strength quietly dry up, the regime is distracted with exotic trivia like gay marriage and the search for new forms of discrimination to combat.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a matter of the law of diminishing marginal returns as applied to &#8220;civil rights.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Both of these are factors, but it may be more important that only intelligent people are forward-looking enough to use birth control.</i></p>
<p>This is why &#8220;flooding the zone&#8221; (as its proponents have said exactly) of young low IQ non-whites with contraceptives isn&rsquo;t going to work, because they won&rsquo;t use it. It&rsquo;s going to take either hard or soft mandated contraception methods that requires no per-time user input. E.g. Depo-Provera, Norplant, gonadectomy, etc.</p>
<p><i>I must acknowledge that a male sex strike is a rather fanciful notion.</i></p>
<p>Helen Smith, the wife of the Instapundit, has written a book about this, about men doing a combination of a sex strike and going Galt. I&rsquo;ve thought all along that, other than the individual benefits for men who do, that the movement overall was going to be a failure. Devlin just provided the answer to why it will fail.</p>
<p><i>This is why I have included Hazlitt&rsquo;s little primer in my list of basic titles for the dissident.</i></p>
<p>At first, I was wondering why Devlin put any economics book in his top ten list which should have included some Madison Grant or Lothrop Stoddard. But now that I&rsquo;ve read his reasoning, I like it.</p>
<p><i>Economics is a science of means, of directing available means fairly and rationally to human ends, every one of which is non-economic. Economics thus cannot provide a sufficient basis for ordering human life as a whole. Economism is the fallacy of trying to make it do so, of confusing the economic good with the human good per se. Wilhelm Röpke got it right when he called for &ldquo;a society with a market, but not a market society&rdquo; in which economic relations swallow up everything else. He described economism as &ldquo;a disorder of spiritual perception.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Economics, being the social science of how people fit unlimited desires into limited resources, is and always has been one part mathematics and nine parts politics. This is why I am no longer hung up on any economic system, other than opposing the worst failed systems. As long as you have the three legged stool intact: High IQ/respect for scientific progress and inquiry, ethnonationalism and group evolutionary strategy, access to plentiful land and resources either in situ or by proxy, you&rsquo;re almost guaranteed to have a prosperous society and prosperous individuals and families by and large; at that point the economic and legal system almost doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also happy that someone other than a few of us here on AR even remember who Wilhelm Ropke is or why he&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p><i>Greg Johnson&rsquo;s summation of Ron Paul&rsquo;s program was perfectly apt: Paul wants to ensure that the little brown people who are taking our country from us will enjoy the benefits of a hard currency. This is the sort of confused priorities that come from having a narrowly economic view of the social good.</i></p>
<p>Better described as the wages of ideological cultism.</p>
<p><i>I am not against political activism by the young, but your primary focus in youth should be on educating yourself. Read the classics, not the bestsellers. Be open to learning from a broad variety of sources, but do not buy into any big ideology or world-view uncritically.</i></p>
<p>All of our people should have some sort of prime keystone hobby that is not related to and has nothing to do with the cause. Not just for something to do when the cause drives us crazy and we need a break from it, but also to answer the question: What do we do when we win? When we win, we won&rsquo;t need the cause anymore by definition.</p>
<p>If we win tomorrow, and conventional politics disappears, ergo my day job disappears, I&rsquo;ll probably be standing out on the corner of Manchester and Clarkson in west St. Louis County the next day wearing a sign that reads, &#8220;Will Do Calculus Tutoring For Food.&#8221;</p>

<p>1. I highly recommend Hazlitt&rsquo;s book. Complex economic ideas explained in simple language.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;&hellip;[A]t that point the economic and legal system almost doesn&rsquo;t matter.&#8221;<br/>
Actually, a successful economy does need a legal system that consistently upholds contracts and property rights.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just that it almost doesn&rsquo;t matter which sort of legal system driven by which ideology or worldview is implemented, as long as the three stools of prosperity are there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s way too much of a propensity for ideologues to give credit to their ideology for everything that goes right.</p>

PR people realize that for every one people that takes the time to complain there are at least 10 more who feel the same way but don&rsquo;t take the time to make a complaint. But on the other hand, they say that it&rsquo;s the older, less tolerant generation that is offended and that soon those unenlightened folks will pass away, so who cares what they think!!! I think there are some people complaining; I&rsquo;m actually seeing white people on ads again, and not just as the fat, bumbling, bespectacled white fools.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-634173" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I read his essay sexual utopia. I immediately realized that one way of testing his theory would be to look at the rate of virginity between college aged men and women. If his theory is true, then there should be more male virgins than female virgins.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t dig into this too deeply, but from what I was able to put together 25% of college aged males are virgins &hellip;which sounds like a lot. But it turns out that 25% of college aged females are also virgins. </p>
<p>So the simple validation test failed. I think that a better perspective is this:</p>
<p>Attractive people &#8220;having sex&#8221; is so prevalent in society (in the media) that below-average to average men and women (in looks) feel &#8220;entitled&#8221; to sex with attractive people. But the laws of nature dictate that this cannot be. Below average to average men and women are basically rejecting one another because they believe that unless their date is a 7+/10, it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>

From my own casual observations I feel very confident in saying that if you take a male and female who are both the same age between 20 and 35 that the female will likely have had many more sexual partners in her life then the male, especially if the female is just moderately attractive. I know I personally fall into your category of men that simply won&rsquo;t bed down with a girl I don&rsquo;t think is attractive to look at but I do know many men who are so sex crazed that will have sex with anything that moves, especially if they have some booze in them. I think the later type of guy is more common then myself. None the less I&rsquo;m positive that your average looking girl my age has a higher notch count then me since she can get laid whenever she wants plus girls don&rsquo;t value looks as highly as men do. Even the guys who will sleep with anything often go home at night to their internet porn where as almost any girl that wants sex besides the most hideous of them can get it. So comparing rates of virginity between males and females isn&rsquo;t really as useful as comparing numbers of sexual partners and frequency of sex.</p>

Amren females, calm down and help the males understand that it is more than power, it is productivity and protection. It IS NOT male versus female. It is ideology. STOP IT. You&rsquo;re doing exactly what they want. Not talking directly to you, JSS. Just generalization. AR is notorious for &#8216;bagging&rsquo; on females (not ALL of you, note; but some of you).

<p>This interview was no exception, i eagerly look forward to getting accustomed to more of Devlin work.</p>
<p>Where i respectfully disagree though is with this assertion:</p>
<blockquote><p> Competition from China alone is going to put an end to this ideological navel-gazing in the not-too-distant future </p></blockquote>
<p>Now i don&rsquo;t pretend to be an expert of modern East Asia but living in the financial capital of the <strike> world </strike> Asia and traveling on a regular basis to all the other newly developed countries in the area (SG, Korea, Taiwan and tier 1,2 and 3 cities in Mainland China) i developed the distinct impression that North East Asia is still on an ascendant economy trajectory but it is also at the same time already mired in a disastrous social, moral and intellectual decline that mirrors the West, sometimes on its own even more extreme terms.</p>
<p>True the institutional pillars of Confucian ideology (school, family, seniority etc.) are still somewhat paid some token respect here and there, but i assure you the old Oriental type, hard-wired, stubborn, uncreative but tough as nails, patriotic and obtuse, greedy but disciplined, is dying a lonely and despised death.</p>
<p>What is left is an appalling humanity made of entitled, mentally unstable, shallow, lazy and quite frankly more often than not fairly dumb youth.</p>
<p>Marriage rates are very low across the whole region, fertility rates the lowest in the world, divorce is easy and widespread, cheating (practiced equally by both men and women) a normal occurrence of life. </p>
<p>Androgynous underweight boys consuming cosmetics and haute couture at record rates, all on mommy and daddy credit cards of course, make up most of the under 40 male population, while women, even adult ones, invariably look and act like some anime bimbo straight out of some neckbeard dream.</p>
<p>A complete lack of taste, coupled with an absurd level of conformism where the flashier the merrier, permeate the local consumer market. If you don&rsquo;t have the means or the desire to conform to the mall squatting herd you&rsquo;re quite literally pushed to insanity and suicide.</p>
<p>The intellectual discourse has been nuclearized to levels so abysmal that would probably make even the average Kardashian fan cringe.<br/>
You turn on your tv or log onto your tab and you are bombarded with some of the trashiest dance music known to mankind, Sex&the City clones, period dramas where ancient kings and queens look like scene kids and the invariable supply of gangsterism and school bullyism glorification.</p>
<p>Professor Devlin it will not be Asia putting the final nail on the coffin of contemporary Western culture. There will be no Asian century for it is already ridden with a disastrous moral decline trailing the West by only a few years.</p>
<p>It will be Africa with her meteoric demographic growth, her savage hatred, her unwashed poverty leading the revolt against civilization of the 21st century (possibly cemented by islam).</p>
<p>This, unfortunately, will be the negro century</p>

And Italy off course got their second chance during WW2 and made no mistakes that time around. Furthermore I don&rsquo;t know what your definition of Bantu is of course, but I guess one could argue that (most) Ethiopians are not really Bantu, but that&rsquo;s a subject for another time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always admired Ethiopians for their defeat of a colonial power and the pride they take in it. is a facinating country even from a European nationalist point of view. I noticed during my visit to the northern part of the country how impressive their cultural and religious traditions are. They are the only Africans (together with their Eritrean cousins to the north) that were not Christianized by Europeans in the last half a century, but were already orthodox Christians (although they adhere to the non-chalcedonian branch). It is the only Christian country in Africa where the term Catholic is seen as an insult and where Christianity is not of the usual shallow pentecostal/protestant/anglican form I&rsquo;ve come across in other parts of Africa. I have no quarrels with them, provided they don&rsquo;t come to Europe in large numbers of course.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether Africa will ever be able to produce countries that can be defined as moderately developed (around the level of Turkey, Iran, Thailand, Vietnam, Mexico etc.), but if there are any countries that I would have to pick as contenders it would be Ethiopia and Eritrea. The Ethiopians are doing better now economically and are engaged in an interesting quarrel with Egypt over a hydroelectric power plant on the Nile river, which is just one of the many, many infrastructure projects I have seen in that country. I wish they can prove us wrong and quickly develop their country at least to the levels of the above mentioned nations. </p>
<p>As to your other point. I hope that liberalism will decline and people will see through the falsehood of multiculturalism, but I am more pessimistic than you are. The only way this would happen in my eyes is rapid economic decline, which would put pressure on this fake consumer driven economic system we have. No white European will riot if his stomach is full, flat screen TV is working and showing his favorite vulgar Hollywood films and professional football team. The shallowness of our people (especially our youth) is just mind-blowing and frighting (mind you I am talking about encounters I had with University students).<br/>
I chuckle every time I read people on this forum mentioning the low IQ of Mestizo&rsquo;s, Arabs and Africans. The superficial lifestyle our youth is leading is dumbing down our society so rapidly that I sometimes question the accuracy of these IQ tests. One could of course argue that we always had masses of poor and ignorant whites ruled by an intellectual elite. That may be true, but the masses seem to be getting more dull every generation.</p>

Race realism articulated is not whats needed for Europe. We need nationalist movements gaining strength. The thought of Dutch people joining hands with Ukrainians, Croats, Romanians and other whites is not realistic. I think people in the US have no idea how alien this concept of whiteness is for people in mainland Europe. Off course in order to be Dutch you have to be white, but whiteness does not necessarily mean Dutch. Being white is necessary, but not sufficient. Cultural-marxist ideology will hopefully decline, but on the other hand when noticing the shallowness of our youth I really wonder if they have what it takes. I can not even discuss European history with college educated students other than some basic topics on WW2. They could care less about art, culture and science. Despite this I still am hopeful as much of the public wants at least a significant decrease in immigration. Thats a first step, but still a long way to go.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-634701" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Baldion first of all thanks for replying to my screed and for your fantastic analysis.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth i am not scared of the rising tide of color per se or a complete perennial dominance of self-defeating liberal ideologies in the West.</p>
<p>What scares me is the enormous and fragile complexity every industrialized society, both in the West and the Far East. relies upon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a strong believer in a &#8220;you&rsquo;re as strong as your weakest link&#8221; philosophy and by making our societies so incredibly sophisticated we also made them fragile.</p>
<p>I forgot who said that Babylonian astrology was hard science based on completely erroneous principles, i think to a certain degree the same applies to our contemporary age.</p>
<p>Our wrongest assumption was basically thinking that Africa could at least evolve toward a middle income (10k $ per capita gdp), middle iq (in the 85-90) range society, something along the lines of modern Turkey or Mexico.</p>
<p>Many globalists, not necessarily liberal, thought African blacks could evolve far enough to have a stake in the new world order, instead of doing forever what they do best: sabotaging, hating, killing and destroying.</p>
<p>The result is we are absolutely unable to cope with spontaneous combustion of African savagery, as we have a built a sand castle based on a free flow of capital, goods, data, people etc. All incredibly fragile institutions that can be shattered more easily than people think. Think about the Ebola disaster, where would we be right now if Ebola was actually a stronger, easier to transmit virus ?</p>
<p>Yes we may stop and reverse the process, that would imply though dismantling a good portion of our current societal organization.</p>
<p>Can we cope with that ? Can we survive life in a society so different than what we have grown accustomed to ? Are we strong enough for real military action ?</p>
<p>Yes France can obliterate Africa but can they protect the rues of Paris ?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-634916" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I can attest to the points you make about Asian moral decline and replicating the West in that aspect, however the issue of African fertility rates are not as solid as you seem to think. Over the last two decades population forecasts have almost continuously been adjusted downwards due to total fertility rates (TFR) dropping substantially in many Sub-Saharan African countries.<br/>
I can give you plenty of examples and reports of countries where a decline in child and maternal mortality, a decrease in the percentage of infected people with malaria, growth in the percentage of women that have access to (primary and secondary) education and growth of overall literacy, led to a spectacular decrease in TFR. </p>
<p>Having visited numerous countries in Africa I obtained a good view on the situation there. I was especially intrigued by the Horn of Africa countries Ethiopia and Eritrea. Their history, people, religion, language and especially their development over the last two decades are interesting to examine even from a European nationalist point of view. Eritrea is only independent for two decades, but has seen a sharp decline in malaria (over 80%), under five mortality (over 50%) an increase in life expectancy (with 66 years its higher than the state of Mississippi) and as result there has been a steep decline in their TFR. At the same time it is locked in a standoff with rival and cultural peer Ethiopia which has led to many economic problems. Despite this the country&rsquo;s capital Asmara is one of the safest in the world. The few whites there can easily stroll around at night (something I would not recommend in parts of (white) Moscow, Kiev, or Belgrade). Despite it&rsquo;s impressive achievements in health, it&rsquo;s economy is hurt by the border dispute with their southern neighbor, which has lead to an exodus of the youth.</p>
<p>Ethiopia on the other hand is the only country never to have been colonized and has witnessed impressive economic growth over the last decade. Their GDP growth for the last ten years has been in the double digits. Even though they start from a low base, that still is impressive for a non-oil economy.<br/>
I&rsquo;ve witnessed up close the huge investments in infrastructure like hydroelectric power stations (the biggest one in Africa is being built right now on the Nile river to the dismay of Egypt), railways (over 5000 KM of rail being built in the coming 5 years), roads and airline services (Ethiopian Airlines is one of the biggest in Africa and a modern airlines that recently joined Star Alliance and purchased the new Dreamliner).<br/>
The leaders of that country have carefully analyzed the economic model used by the Asian tigers (especially PRC, Vietnam and ROK) and are replicating that model (huge public investments in infrastructure, de-facto one-party system, attracting a growing number of labor-intensive investment so as to provide jobs to their growing population, keeping sectors of the economy like banking, telecom and power nationalized until they are able to compete with foreign competitors). If their growth rates continue (and they are forecasted to do so for the coming years), they can easily reach the GDP per capita levels of Vietnam, Morocco, Tunisia and many Latin-American countries within two decades. Their main problem in my eyes is that their TFR has not dropped substantially enough to rapidly decrease their population growth rates. They have many additional problems as well off course, but my main point is that you can not extrapolate the demographic trends of now into the future without carefully taking into account the many factors that influence that variable. Anyone with even a basic understanding of econometrics and statistics (especially Bayesian Econometrics) should know that.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we will witness anything like the demographic projections we have seen for Africa. If our governments in the West continue to contribute a modest amount of funding for health programs there, we will see the continuation of rapid declining TFR. This century will not be the African century. It will be the century where culural-marxism and multuculturalist dogma will be refuted and abandoned. I&rsquo;m not as familiar with the political situation in the US, but I can attest to the fact that all over Europe we are witnessing a rise in Nationalist movements and pressure to completely overhaul our immigration policy. Oddly enough most people I question about immigration, seem to have a problem with unskilled Africans and especially Arabs migrating, but see no threat in the migration of skilled Asians. If there is a flood that will be a threat to my people, it will be the flood of &#8216;highly-skilled&rsquo; Asians coming here taking middle-class and upper-class jobs. That is the real danger in my eyes. A migration policy shift that will resemble the points system in Canada, or the infamous H1B visa in the US, is something we should actively lobby against, since that threat is less visible to the masses of European people.</p>

I enjoy everything Jared Taylor writes and most of what he publishes, with the exception of this garbage. One reason I will forever remain a &#8220;closet&#8221; realist and never make any attempt to connect with a community, on this site or elsewhere, is due to the seeming prevalence of such mindless misogyny. I do not even consider myself a feminist by mainstream standards, but the above is about on par with gender politics in some Arab country. No thanks.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-634630" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&rsquo;m a woman too, and while the men in the race realist community sometimes go a bit far with their denigration of women, I don&rsquo;t think mindless misogyny is <i>that</i> common here.</p>
<p>They do tend to have a fairly conservative view of sex differences, but I think they&rsquo;re quite right that men and women really <i>are</i> different on a biological level. And unfortunately, women do tend to be more emotional and irrational than men, which means they&rsquo;re less capable of coldly weighing costs and benefits. </p>
<p>This is why they&rsquo;re so much more likely than men to think it&rsquo;s acceptable to let in unlimited numbers of poor brown and black people. It&rsquo;s the irrational, pathological empathy talking, which they quite often genuinely cannot control, and they will not realize the mistake they&rsquo;ve made until their children end up paying the ultimate price for it (and by then it will be too late).</p>
<p>Because of this, I do think we might be better off if women couldn&rsquo;t vote. I enjoy having the right to vote myself, but I&rsquo;d happily give it up if it meant liberal women couldn&rsquo;t vote anymore. </p>
<p>I also think everyone is better off if men are the heads of their households. This does <i>not</i> mean I support men being brutal to their women, though. It is never acceptable for a man to treat his wife (or any woman) that way. The way Arabs treat their women is appalling, and I absolutely don&rsquo;t want it brought to white countries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <i>because</i> I don&rsquo;t want those men and their behavior here that I believe women must be more restrained politically and socially. It&rsquo;s <i>women</i> who disproportionately support letting in Muslims. Strangely, the feminists seem to support this even more than regular women! </p>
<p>Moreover, I believe that marriage and families are the bedrock of society, and though I&rsquo;m not religious, I think divorce should be avoided in almost all cases (excepting situations such as serious spousal or child abuse). Women initiate most divorces, and the majority of those divorces are for frivolous reasons. The laws should be changed to avoid these divorces, even though it will make some women who are bored with their husbands sad.</p>
<p>Sorry I&rsquo;ve gotten a bit off topic, but the point I wanted to make is that it&rsquo;s really not so bad for women in the racial realist community, and their beliefs about women aren&rsquo;t quite as misogynistic or irrational as they might appear at first glance (and some women, such as myself, believe many of the same things as them). I post here often and no one has ever treated me badly or said rude things because I&rsquo;m a woman. Most of the men here just seem happy to see that there are some women who believe the same things about race as they do.</p>

<p>But the things that have been said that women like myself disagree with, are the comments implying that women should be uniquely blamed for most of society&rsquo;s failings, including with relationships. If men are the more capable sex, and they most certainly are, then it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to blame women when society goes south ( and yes, I think some of the accusations and blame directed towards women on here after presidential elections as well as the stuff about 90% of divorces being initiated by women are over the top).</p>
<p>If you look at any society or any race, the men lead, and the women follow. White American women are simply products of an already failed and liberal culture. Our society is currently the way it is because too many of our men are going with the flow as well. Our people have been flirting with unhealthy liberal ideas ever since the Enlightenment if not before. So while it is definitely true that women, through no fault of their own, are more irrational and emotional than their men in any society, I don&rsquo;t think it makes much sense to be blaming white women mostly for our current state of affairs. Do you agree?</p>
<p>There have been some extremely harsh and careless statements made on here that are very different from anything you have listed above. But this is why I have chosen to remove myself from it lately (not entirely like the other commenter above, but I am spending less time with the internet portion and focusing more on the time I have spent at conferences where the men present are universally kind). The men who say such harsh things on the internet appear to only be a minority of the overall movement, so it is best to ignore them. Plus they might be hurting in ways I am not aware of.</p>

<p>I agree; while women disproportionately support political policies that destroy society, no movement (not even feminism) can become powerful without male support and direction. Women don&rsquo;t have the necessary drive to enact drastic social change without men leading the way, and women would never have gained the vote without substantial male support.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we are where we are because enough men thought things such as feminism and racial egalitarianism were good ideas to enact those policies. Since men are the natural rulers of any society, it is up to them to control what direction that society heads in.</p>
<p>The blame must rightly lie with those liberal men who failed in their duty to defend Western civilization and allowed their women to open Pandora&rsquo;s box.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-634965" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for the well thought out response. In closing I would like to say that the differences between how white men and women vote really aren&rsquo;t as substantial as people on here claim. I don&rsquo;t think women should vote but I think right now our biggest concern should be the nonwhite vote. Sometimes I feel that people on here look at the womens&rsquo; vote overall and compare it to how white men vote. The way white women by themselves vote is far more conservative than how the women of all races combined vote and really not that significantly different from how white men vote.</p>

<p>What does that mean in this century? ANY action a white man takes, particularly by themselves, opens them up for a shakedown by the legal system. Feminism is only part of the cause. White women also need to grow a pair, and support their men. </p>
<p>Naturally I am not suggesting blind allegiance to someone just because they fit the shade, that would be simplistic and foolish. I&rsquo;m only saying that knowing how the system is skewed can be a powerful temptation. But using that power to destroy a white man&rsquo;s life, just because you can, is not helping our cause.</p>
<p>And most of the people placed into this position are white women. The rest are white men of another sort.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is the case at all. There are plenty of parties who are interested in the perpetuation of the welfare state. I have not done much research into this, but my brother (who is studying economics) tells me that some major program that was begun in the early 20th century was strongly supported by wealthy people because they believed it would give the poor/&#8221;middle class&#8221; enough to be complacent and not present any major competitive threat.</p>

I got tired of being unfairly called a feminist ( by a very small percentage on here mind you) when I am not one at all. My argument has always been that men are the more capable sex. But if that is the case, it also makes little sense to blame women mostly for the failings of a civilization. It is that second part that has always got me in trouble on here.</p>
<p>I would rather show up at conferences and have healthy discussions with the great men of the pro white cause, face to face instead of on the internet. I have gone to conferences ever since 06 only to be supportive. I don&rsquo; t go to be overbearing or to get behind the microphone. The men there like seeing women like me show up. </p>
<p>It is only on the internet portion of the movement that I have been shown hostility, which is why I have chosen to avoid it lately. There are a lot of wounded people who come on here to type their thoughts and I have learned that it is better to let them do as they will, and ignore them, as opposed to reasoning with them.</p>

<p>I think the achilles heel of the woman is her empathy, which is not a bad thing per se (quite the contrary), but can easily overwhelm the ability to think critically.</p>
<p>The achilles heel of the man on the other hand is his sex drive, which again is not necessarily bad, but also easily overwhelms critical thinking. Even highly intelligent men often make stupid choices regarding women that leave me facepalming.</p>
<p> Consider that for every woman who unilaterally divorces her husband, there is a man who married a woman who would divorce him first! If men made rational choices in their partners, the divorce rates would go down rapidly.</p>
<p>I do not believe that women should submit to their husbands or that they need to be &#8220;kept in check&#8221;. A good relationship consists of two partners loving and respecting each other. Love is the best recipe against divorce.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-634645" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I thought that when Devlin mentioned the left &#8220;needs new discriminations to combat&#8221;, he was describing the Obama regime to a T. The Obama regime has done more for promoting gay marriage than it has in creating new jobs. It has fallen in love with the notion of combatting &#8220;economic inequality&#8221; without even defining what &#8220;economic inequality&#8221; is. The Obama regime is also fixated on &#8220;going green&#8221; in this country, while at the same time importing millions of people; people who are not known for being &#8220;eco-friendly&#8221; in their countries of origin. How will they be expected to be eco-friendly here? The Obama regime loves to hype up &#8220;global warming&#8221; threats on the one hand, while expecting solar and wind power to meet this country&rsquo;s energy needs on the other.</p>
<p>I was also glad to see Devlin take Ron Paul to task - while Paul&rsquo;s idea to audit the Federal Reserve for the first time in its history is a good one - he also wants more and more mestizos and other immigrants in this country.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-634666" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Very accurate opinion on women. This guy is brilliant on some of his points. I have been speaking about this in my posts. His female sexual dynamics discussion is very good.</p>
<p>1) Women&rsquo;s morality is dependent on ACCOUNTABILITY. If men don&rsquo;t hold them accountable for their poor behavior, women will act like they do in modern ages. They will act as sluts until mid to late 30s, when they consider marriage to some beta chump they can divorce 5 to 10 years later.</p>
<p>2) A &#8220;male strike&#8221; can work in that it collapses the economic basis of the society. I don&rsquo;t agree that if 90% of men strike, the other 10% could make up for it. If only 10-20% of White males decide to stop working, our economic output would collapse. This would cause the collapse of the West more quickly.</p>
<p>3) I don&rsquo;t see White males waking up until there is a collapse. Unfortunately, by this point of time, it will likely be too late. This is due to the very low segment of the population that the Whites have become. Whites better wake up to feminism.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-634676" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Interesting, frequently right- but also narrow, simplistic,&hellip;</p>
<p>Just a few points I disagree with.</p>
<p>1. Mr. Devlin has written extensively (I&rsquo;ve read some of his texts) on male-female dynamics &amp; female sexuality. I think his ideas pretty well describe the situation in middle-class and &#8220;intellectual&#8221; circles of Anglosphere &amp; Northern Europe, but are not as universal as the author would think they are. For instance, they do not apply to most Central &amp; Eastern Europeans, let alone other, non-white cultures &amp; civilizations. Heck, they don&rsquo;t apply to the French !</p>
<p>Devlin is right when he muses about masochistic component of female sexuality, but he&rsquo;s certainly figured the big picture wrong. He seems to think that, sexually, females are turned on by male aggression, brutality, &#8220;gorillity&#8221; etc. This is just an aspect of a broader truth: women are attracted to male power &amp; dominance, which can be physical- but also intellectual, social, financial, whatever. Doesn&rsquo;t he know that legendary lovers, most successful womanizers- perhaps this is a shallow description, lovers is better- have been Raphael, Goethe, Chopin, Franz Liszt, Victor Hugo, Lord Byron, Pushkin,&hellip; in short, artistic &#8220;celebrities&#8221;- not a particularly masculine bunch ? Google Taki mag myth of effeminate poet Somerset. Or Jean Paul Sartre, that ugly dwarf who dominated his ever-expanding harem ? Or, if we remove creativity, contemporary celebrities (movies, music) who are also not too &#8220;masculine&#8221;, according to stereotypes. It&rsquo;s glory, dominance, fame, success, power, &hellip; that females are usually attracted to, not physicality as such, let alone physical abuse. Rape fantasies are about dominance, not about actual rape.<br/>
Perhaps Mr. Devlin&rsquo;s perception is molded by his American identity, where dominance is frequently identified with physical and/or financial power.</p>
<p>2. as regards female morality, this too is &#8220;Anglospheroid&#8221;. Devlin is right when he- implicitly- agrees with Lawrence Kohlberg &amp; other researchers (especially child and developmental psychologists) that men, ideally, are more inclined to be governed by abstract moral principles, and women by empathy. But, there are numerous strata of morality, and very few men &amp; women attain to higher levels of morality. In sum- most men &amp; women are opportunists, yes-sayers &amp; moral cowards. Such is life. Where Devlin is- IMO- wrong is his denial of female moral autonomy. Judging both from personal experience &amp; various studies, this is not true. Women are no less moral than men, on average. Just, their way to morality is more through &#8220;heart&#8221;, than through &#8220;mind&#8221;. Mr. Devlin is- at least it looks like- rather sympathetic towards eastern Europeans. Well, hasn&rsquo;t he heard of Decembrists&rsquo; wives ? His ideas about female morality seem to be that of an embittered romantic.</p>
<p>3. Devlin&rsquo;s ideas about Jews &amp; Jewish identity are partially right and generally wrong. His &#8220;guru&#8221; about the subject is Kevin MacDonald, whose trilogy is a mixed bag, but central ideas are simply- wrong. In short: Judaism is not some evolutionary strategy, but an authentic ethnic religious culture- something like Zoroastrianism. Until emancipation in the beginning of the 19th C, Jews had led mostly separate lives (in Christian and Islamic countries) &amp; did not contribute, significantly, to Western -or any other- cultural development &amp; upheavals. From early 1800s to the present, assimilated Jews have been prominent in many fields (as we all know). But, they are assimilated. Most of them thought of themselves as Germans, French, Russians,..and not primarily as Jews. Some, of course, did have a primary Jewish loyalty, but they were in minority. Intermarriage among Jewish Germans in wake of Hitler&rsquo;s rise to power was close to 50%, and in most Western countries, now, is between 50% and 80%. It&rsquo;s ethnic meltdown. Einstein was right when he observed: &#8220;If it were not for anti- Semitism, Jews would have dispersed among host peoples like leaves in the wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mr. Devlin is right when he speaks of &#8220;organized Jewry&#8221;. These are Zionists, Jewish identitarians, whatnot&hellip; This segment is liberal to the core &amp; is, especially in the US, more or less opposed to America as a historically white European country. Just- they comprise maybe 10-15% of all people who self-identify as &#8220;Jews&#8221; in the US. In European countries the situation is, re Jewish identity or organized &#8220;power&#8221; even more fragile. There is no significant Jewish influence (as Jewish-identitarian) in Italy, Russia, France, Sweden, Germany, Spain,&hellip; Liberalism and multiculturalism are products of white European culture at this stage of decadence, and not some imaginary Jewish conspiracy.</p>
<p>4. at the end, Mr. Devlin sounds like a nostalgic conservative (&#8220;things were better back in the Eisenhower era&#8221;). Also, he seems to be fascinated by fertility &amp; &#8220;raw numbers&#8221; of human masses. IMO, all this is naive. We are now in different position from Romans 400 A.D. Romans were not equal to organized &amp; militarily trained masses of &#8220;barbarians&#8221;.</p>
<p>But, contemporary situation is fundamentally different. Science &amp; technology are the crucial factor. Even second rate power like France can (nuclear submarines) wipe all human life from Africa and India. And I won&rsquo;t elaborate on true powers, the US and Russia. Devlin thinks that liberal ideology (diversity, ethnic swamping through immigration, gender lunacies,..) are here to stay until the bitter demise of white Europeans. </p>
<p>This is, IMO, completely unsubstantiated prediction.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-640997" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The Jews have always tried to destroy the white race by making it cool that it is trendy and fashionable to be down with a negro. After WW-2, the Jews started promoting interracial relations with their musical &#8216;South Pacific&rsquo;. Even though Rogers &amp; Hammerstein received flak for that, they refused to apologize. Just are our misfortune.<br/>
Just look at the TV shows promoting that. Even in Britain they are doing the same thing. I saw the episode of the &#8216;Paradise&rsquo; yesterday and it is set in the late 1800s and in that too they have a negro as a scientist/ photographer that white women are enthralled with. In the end a white woman is seen kissing him. I bet in those days none of that inter racial nonsense happened.</p>
