<h1 class="title">Muslim Immigration and the West</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Henry Wolff, American Renaissance, October 10, 2014</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
It&rsquo;s time to stop the madness.</div> 
</div> 



<p>This past Saturday, authorities <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/06/us/teen-isis-support-arrest/index.html">arrested</a> Mohammed Hamzah Khan at O&rsquo;Hare International Airport, where he intended to board a plane to Turkey and then join the Islamic State [ISIS]. Federal agents discovered pro-ISIS documents at Mr. Khan&rsquo;s home, including a drawing of an ISIS fighter that said, &#8220;Come to Jihad.&#8221;</p>
<p>In August, 33-year-old Minnesota rapper Douglas McAuthur McCain <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/american-douglas-mcauthur-mccain-dies-fighting-isis-syria-n189081">became</a> the first US citizen to die fighting for ISIS. Defense Secretary Charles Hagel <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/09/us-believes-a-dozen-americans-are-fighting-with-isis-in-syria/">says</a> there are a dozen or so other Americans fighting for ISIS, and 100 US citizens with the jihadists in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<div id="attachment_110817" style="width: 513px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DouglasMcAuthur.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-110817" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DouglasMcAuthur.jpg" alt="Douglas McAuthur" width="503" height="500" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DouglasMcAuthur.jpg 503w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DouglasMcAuthur-150x150.jpg 150w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DouglasMcAuthur-300x298.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Douglas McAuthur McCain</p></div>
<p>McCain was a black American who converted to Islam, but he was an exception. &ldquo;American&rdquo; jihadists are almost always Muslim immigrants or the children of Muslim immigrants. McCain himself was caught up in fanaticism that foreigners have brought to our shores. Islamic violence and a whole host of host of other problems stemming from Muslim immigration were entirely avoidable. Indeed, the disadvantages of Muslim immigration are so great and the advantages so few that Western countries are justified in asking why they should permit any Muslim immigration at all.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate Muslims</strong></p>
<p>Whenever fanatical, violent Muslims are in the news, liberals and even some conservatives point out that there are many moderate, assimilated Muslims. This does not change the fact there are many Muslims who would like to kill their non-Muslim neighbors.</p>
<p>In 2013, the Pew Research Center <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/09/10/muslim-publics-share-concerns-about-extremist-groups/">held face-to-face interviews</a> with 9,000 Muslims in 11 countries in the Middle East and South Asia. A median 16 percent of those interviewed said suicide bombings or other violence against civilians are &#8220;sometimes&#8221; or &#8220;often&#8221; justified &#8220;to defend Islam from its enemies.&#8221; In Egypt, for example, 25 percent said suicide bombings and similar attacks in defense of Islam are at least sometimes justified. <a href="http://www.cis.org/immigrant-population-record-2013">From 2010 to 2013</a>, more than 38,000 Egyptians immigrated to the United States.</p>
<p>This chart shows the Pew data as well as the number of immigrants from each of the countries living in the United States, and shows how much their numbers have changed from 2010 to 2013.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CivilianViolence.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-111427" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CivilianViolence.jpg" alt="CivilianViolence" width="633" height="461" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CivilianViolence.jpg 633w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CivilianViolence-300x218.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px"/></a></p>
<p>Pew also asked Muslims what they thought of al Qaeda. A median of 13 percent had at least somewhat favorable views of the terrorist organization. This chart shows the results.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AlQaedaViews.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-111428" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AlQaedaViews.jpg" alt="AlQaedaViews" width="604" height="454" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AlQaedaViews.jpg 604w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AlQaedaViews-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px"/></a></p>
<p>Many Muslim immigrants and their descendents living in the United States are probably unwilling to admit to a pollster that they have extreme views, but some are openly fanatic. In 2011, a Pew <a href="../../../files/2011/08/muslim-american-report.pdf">survey</a> found that 1 percent of Muslims in America think suicide bombings and other violence against civilians is &#8220;often&#8221; justified, 7 percent say it is &#8220;sometimes&#8221; justified, and 5 percent say it is justified, but only &#8220;rarely.&#8221; Five percent of US Muslims also view al Qaeda at least somewhat favorably. In addition, 6 percent say there is a great deal of support for extremism among Muslims in America and 15 percent say there is a fair amount of support.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/20/new-muslim-american-council-aims-to-measure-a-diverse-community/">low estimate</a> of the US Muslim population is 2.75 million. That means there are over 350,000 Muslims in America who think blowing up civilians to defend Islam is acceptable in some cases, and that there are more than 137,000 with a favorable view of the organization responsible for the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>And it takes far fewer than that to take the kind of action that is increasingly common throughout Western countries. Last month, the BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29245611">reported</a> that police conducted pre-dawn raids in Sydney, Australia, arresting 15 Muslims who were plotting to behead random Australians in the name of ISIS. The reporter said the plot &#8220;will shock many people here, including the vast majority of this country&rsquo;s long-established moderate Muslim community.&#8221; The community was upset alright, but by the raids: Two hundred Muslims <a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/south-west/muslims-and-supporters-gathered-to-protest-perceived-police-brutality/story-fngr8hxh-1227064206212">held a protest</a> that night against what they called police brutality.</p>
<p>Liberals typically excuse bad behavior by blaming it on poverty and a lack of education. A <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0090718&amp;representation=PDF">recent survey</a> of British Muslims, however, found that &#8220;people in education and high earners were more likely to support radical acts.&#8221; Also, Muslims who were born in Britain were more likely to sympathize with terrorist acts than Muslims who had immigrated.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2740268/The-private-school-jihadist-As-PM-unveils-new-terror-crackdown-Scots-girl-incites-bloody-massacre-British-streets.html">Aqsa Mahmood</a>, born in Scotland, is a good example. She is the 20-year-old daughter of a Pakistani immigrant and successful businessman, and was educated at the Craigholme School, Glasgow&rsquo;s top private academy. One school friend describes her as a &#8220;usual, typical girl&#8221; who was &#8220;really confident&#8221; and could &#8220;talk to anyone she wanted.&#8221; Last November, Miss Mahmood dropped out of university and disappeared to join ISIS. In between tweets about her new life as a mother, she encourages her Twitter followers to &#8220;Follow the examples of your brothers from Woolwich, Texas and Boston,&#8221; referring to the murder of Lee Rigby, the Fort Hood shooting, and the Boston Marathon bombing. &#8220;If you cannot make it to the battlefield, then bring the battlefield to yourself,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p><strong>Importing danger</strong></p>
<p>Of course, it is Westerners who have brought the battlefield to ourselves. If there were no Muslims in our midst, ISIS would not threaten us. Instead, we have admitted into our countries the very people our rulers claim to be combating abroad. The Muslims who do integrate are a cover for those who want to harm us.</p>
<p>The European Union&rsquo;s Anti-Terrorism Chief Gilles de Kerchove <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29372494">estimates</a> that 3,000 Muslims from Europe have gone to Iraq and Syria to join ISIS. In Britain alone, the figure is <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/twice-many-british-muslims-fighting-isis-armed-forces-265865">at least 400</a>. The British daily <em>The Independent </em><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-british-women-running-sharia-police-unit-for-islamic-state-in-syria-9717510.html">reports</a> that 60 women from Britain have traveled to Syria and joined an all-female police unit called al-Khansaa, which enforces a strict form of sharia law on civilian women. The International Center for the Study of Radicalization says &ldquo;The British women are some of the most zealous in imposing the ISIS laws in the region.&#8221; They are also reportedly <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2751506/Thousands-Iraqi-women-forced-sex-slavery-Isis-militants-kept-brothels-run-police-forceof-British-women-jihadis.html">running ISIS brothels</a> where non-Muslim women from the Yazidi tribe in Iraq are forced into sex slavery.</p>
<p>Jihadist exports from the West can hurt us only if they come back. Even President Obama <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2014/06/obama-serious-threat-to-the-us-from-trained-terrorists-191278.html">realizes</a> that they can get combat training in Iraq and Syria, &#8220;then they come back, they have European passports, they don&rsquo;t need a visa to get into the United States.&#8221; In August, Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/met-chief-sir-bernard-hoganhowe-warns-of-londons-200-militarised-jihadi-fighters-9693477.html">said</a> about 250 fighters had already returned from Iraq and Syria, and that close to 200 had settled in London. That same month, Britain <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/britains-terror-threat-dramatically-raised-to-severe-9699652.html">raised</a> its terror threat to &#8220;severe,&#8221; meaning a terrorist attack is &#8220;highly likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several countries have passed laws to revoke the citizenship or invalidate the passports of suspected terrorists. This year Britain <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/world/europe/britain-broadens-power-to-strip-terrorism-suspects-of-citizenship.html?_r=1">approved legislation</a> expanding the government&rsquo;s power to revoke citizenship even if it results in statelessness. Since 2006, Britain has stripped 42 suspected terrorists of citizenship, with a record of 20 just last year. Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands are also <a href="http://www.thelocal.no/20140825/norway-to-revoke-citizenship-of-terror-warriors-fighting-abroad">considering</a> denaturalizing citizens who fight for groups such as ISIS. The Canadian government <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/09/20/canadian-government-revoking-passports-of-citizens-trying-to-join-extremist-groups/">has begun</a> suspending the passports of Muslims who have either already gone, or intend to go fight in Iraq and Syria. The government said 30 Canadians are active in Syria, and 130 are fighting elsewhere, but would not say how many passports had been revoked.</p>
<p>Last month, Senator Ted Cruz <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/18/dems-block-cruz-strip-citizenship-isis-defectors/">introduced</a> legislation that would make joining ISIS &#8220;an affirmative renunciation of American citizenship.&#8221; The legislation was blocked by Democrats who were worried about &ldquo;constitutional implications.&rdquo; FBI Director James Comey <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/fbi-director-americans-fighting-isis-entitled-come-back">says</a> that for now, US citizens fighting for ISIS are &#8220;entitled to come back,&#8221; but that authorities &#8220;will track them very carefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>The threat posed by ISIS is only the most recent example of violence and potential violence by Muslim immigrants. <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/07/60-terrorist-plots-since-911-continued-lessons-in-domestic-counterterrorism">Here</a> is a list of 60 jihadist plots that have been foiled in the United States since the September 11 attacks. This April, for example, Moroccan national El Mehdi Semlali Fahti <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-man-in-connecticut-plotted-to-fly-drone-like-toy-planes-with-bombs-into-school/">was arrested</a> in Connecticut for plotting to fly bombs attached to radio-controlled airplanes into a school and a federal building. Mr. Fahti was in the country illegally after overstaying his visa for seven years and lying to an immigration judge while seeking political asylum. The most famous recent plot that succeeded was, of course, by the two Chechen immigrants who <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2013/04/23/number-injured-marathon-bombing-revised-downward/NRpaz5mmvGquP7KMA6XsIK/story.html">killed</a> three Americans and injured an estimated 264 at the Boston Marathon using pressure-cooker bombs.</p>
<p>Sometimes Muslims express their hatred differently. In Rotherham, England, Pakistani rape gangs &#8220;groomed&#8221; at least 1,400 young white girls from 1997 to 2013, according to a <a href="http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/1407/independent_inquiry_cse_in_rotherham">government report</a> released this August. The author <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-28939089">called</a> the 1,400 figure a &#8220;conservative estimate,&#8221; and said authorities could have stopped the problem sooner, but they were afraid of being called &#8220;racist.&#8221; She noted that two reports on similar behavior released years earlier had been &#8220;effectively repressed.&#8221; More than a dozen similar gangs have been convicted of operating <a href="http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3068/muslim-child-rape-gangs-britain">elsewhere</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-27394888">in Britain</a>.</p>
<p>Muslim rape gangs are also active in Australia. The most notorious was a group of 14 Lebanese convicted in 2002 of raping white girls as young as 14 in Sydney. These crimes are invariably committed against girls from the host population, not fellow Muslims, and the Sidney attacks were <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/13/1026185124700.html">widely described</a> as hate crimes.</p>
<p><strong>Enrichment?</strong></p>
<p>Liberals say Muslim immigrants enrich us with their culture, but can even the most committed multiculturalists give us a single example of enrichment? It is debatable whether many Americans have gained any wholesome cultural experiences from our three million Muslims. However, nearly every American has lost civil liberties, been a victim of mass surveillance, and undergone cumbersome airport screening as a result of the Muslims among us.</p>
<p>There are other costs. School districts wrestle with the question of whether to serve pork in school lunches or celebrate Muslim holidays. Universities face demands to set aside women-only swimming-pool hours so that Muslims can escape the gaze of men. Activist Muslim groups try to <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/diversity-is-strength-it-s-also-the-end-of-free-speech">shut down</a> lectures by speakers critical of Islam.</p>
<p>And how many people chose not to run in the Boston Marathon this year? How many decided to drive after Iraq&rsquo;s prime minister <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/09/25/iraqi-pm-plot-to-attack-us-paris-subways-uncovered/">warned</a> last month of an ISIS plot to attack subways in the United States and France? Even today, how many worry whenever they board an airplane?</p>
<p>Liberals should have their own reasons for not wanting Muslims in the West: Muslims are some of the strongest opponents of feminism and homosexual rights. Indeed, it was on these grounds-and not for racial or ethnic reasons-that the Dutchman <a href="../../../features/2014/09/the-legacy-of-pim-fortuyn.html">Pim Fortuyn</a> became his country&rsquo;s most effective opponent of Muslim immigration.</p>
<p>Islam has caused tremendous destruction. Yet it gives believers a sense of commitment that has no parallel in the West. Viewed objectively-and setting aside, if that is possible, the immense suffering it has caused-Muslim dedication is a refreshing contrast to the aimlessness of so many Americans and Europeans.</p>
<p>But Islam has no place in the West. Unless our civilizations stay out of each others&rsquo; way, there will be perpetual conflict. Separation is the best solution-both for Westerners of all political persuasions, and for Muslims.</p>

<p>Right on. They&rsquo;re more apt to convert silly Americans&hellip;..certainly blacks&hellip;..to their religion than any of them would assimilate into this culture.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-624796" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>We should write &#8220;The Book of the Whites&#8221; for a start. Summarizing our history, reminding what made us great and what should be done to keep us great&hellip; and white. And why.</p>
<p>Actually I am an atheist but not an anti-religion one and I have been thinking about this for a while and I do think maybe we don&rsquo;t have the choice and our best bet is to make up a white religion. </p>
<p>Religious ideologies have control the masses for the longest times&hellip; other ideologies, although more modern in thinking didn&rsquo;t do that yet, true maybe those were incorrect/were not matching truly humans, specifically whites. Although of course, I would prefer it not to be religious, to be vague enough to make atheists like me endorse it and still to please religious people. </p>
<p>If people can write a book without using the letter e, I think it is possible to write a book without the words god or evolution lol or at least to acknowledge that some see god when others see probability, chaos, physics or evolution. To find a compromise. Similarly allow men to be men but ease the concerns of women and so on about other fractions to avoid any shism.</p>
<p>Not a history and not a holy book about a &#8220;Creator&#8221;, not a anthropology, not a atheist book or not a Norse or Christian book etc, but all of these in one and more. Like a guide, an anthology, with scientific facts, great men/&#8221;prophets&#8221;, parables and laws/morals for us whites. As if to be able to help white survivors to rebuild a better white society if all knowledge/if this world as we know it is destroyed. To explain them the world, as if to answer existentialist and moral questions etc. </p>
<p>I think that this is the reason thousands years ago, that people invented the stories and myths around the camp-fire, that eventually made up the world religions. They were explaining their worlds to the kids and themselves with the knowledge they have at that time. </p>
<p>Maybe it is time for a new book, but specifically for the whites&hellip;</p>
<p>Indeed like you say, islam has its appeal for some, during our era of depravity and laxism, when Christianity has no leader who strengthen it but on the contrary are weakening all the messages that people need to hear nowadays. Same in the political and philosophical realms. No clear way, no Jean d&rsquo;Arc nor Brave Heart, no order.<br/>
So indeed, we should come up with a &#8220;cure&#8221;, the timing is ripe.</p>
<p>Maybe one day, maybe during an Amren conference, some interested Amreners could get together and do a brainstorming session and start to write that book&hellip;</p>

Mormonism is practically the only Christian denomination untainted by cultural Marxism. The vast majority of Mormons are white, conservative, and stick to their own. They value the family, marry young, and have many kids. It&rsquo;s also unique in that it&rsquo;s one of the few religious denominations completely invented and developed and centered in America. As a Catholic American sickened by the compromising leftism of our current Pope, I&rsquo;ll tell you now Mormons, despite some of their bizarre teachings, have more respect from me than most of the Catholics I know.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-618395" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Very simply, they do not belong among us. Islam was created by nomadic Bedouins in the Saudi Arabian desert where and by whom their &#8220;prophet&#8221; was raised. It should not be surprising then that Arabs and others from the Middle East would be attracted to this primitive religion. It suits them well. It is a deeply ingrained part of their culture, not ours. In the end, we will always arrive at the same truth: All people belong with their own kind and in their own nations. The notion that multiracial societies are something to be desired is built on a foundation of ignorance and lies.</p>

Basically, they celebrated Ramadan, spoke Farsi, and that was it. They were WAY more interested in making money as fine jewelers than observing anything but the most general, widely-recognized Muslim holidays. Never went to mosque, nothing. Sort of like &#8220;cultural Christians&#8221; who go to church twice a year and never read the Bible.</p>
<p>If asked about their feelings on terrorism, they&rsquo;d basically shrug. However, they absolutely DETESTED &#8220;Black Muslims&#8221;. They thought the two words should never go together, and that Black Islam bore little resemblance to mainstream Islam. I thought it was interesting to listen to an Iranian family&rsquo;s opinion on the Negroes &#8220;stealing&#8221; their religion.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-619791" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that the Koran isn&rsquo;t written chronologically: these verses are arranged longest to shortest (or vice versa, I can&rsquo;t recall). So it&rsquo;s difficult for even students of Islam to discern how Mohammed changed his opinion of &#8220;Allah&#8221; as he became older and more extreme. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how CAIR and other anti-American Islamic organizations continue to deceive the average American: they whip out the more moderate verses any chance they get (like the one about tolerating Jews and Christians, which the Koran called &#8220;People of the Book&#8221;). They know the average western person has no idea that the principle of understanding &#8220;Allah&rsquo;s&#8221; decree on any subject (since &#8220;he&#8221; constantly contradicted himself) was to take the most recent verse as &#8220;the Final Word&#8221;.</p>
<p>Earlier in Mohammed&rsquo;s career, he was feeling somewhat generous toward converts, telling his followers that if they don&rsquo;t want to convert to Islam, just leave them be. As he got older and more violent, however, he told his followers to behead the infidels if they wouldn&rsquo;t convert. So the later command essentially replaces the earlier one. CAIR knows most people are unaware of this little loophole, and take advantage of only advertising Mohammed&rsquo;s &#8220;gentle, moderate&#8221; verses from when he was young. All Muslims know full well that those early, moderate Koran &#8220;commandments&#8221; had been declared null and void centuries ago.</p>

Since 2006, Britain has stripped 42 suspected terrorists of citizenship, with a record of 20 just last year. Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands are also considering denaturalizing citizens who fight for groups such as ISIS. The Canadian government has begun suspending the passports of Muslims who have either already gone, or intend to go fight in Iraq and Syria.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so weird that European countries (and Canada) are ahead of us on this. America is usually considered to be much more conservative than them, but we&rsquo;re the ones inviting ISIS fighters with U.S. citizenship to return to the country.</p>

Despite all the championing of feminism, and respect shown for women (it almost seems a contest), by nearly everyone, and despite all the hand wringing over domestic violence, women will not marry a man who is smaller and weaker than herself. Even the aura of violence attracts women. Political correctness is likely a form of violence, somehow. It&rsquo;s wielded, normally, as a weapon. Is there anyone who does not bow down to it?</p>

I suspect at it&rsquo;s heart, political correctness, the modern age, call it what you will, owes it&rsquo;s success to violence. Keep in mind, it would often be white men who would be expected to be the gatekeepers in protecting women and people of color. People aren&rsquo;t taking principled positions; they&rsquo;re afraid to hold any others. Now it is mostly words and some guy on social media being punished serving a message to everyone else, or even someone &#8216;taking a stand&rsquo; on the message boards on social media. It&rsquo;s mostly words but I suspect at it&rsquo;s heart they intend it to be a real fear.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-619101" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Henry Wolff is absolutely right of course.</p>
<p>Just stop a few moments and think this one out. Prior to 1945, there were, at first approximation, zero Muslims present on the soil of either the USA or the UK to quote but two examples. It is reasonable to say, that at that time very few Americans or Britons had but the vaguest understanding of Islam or Muslims, and by and large didn&rsquo;t think too much about it and cared even less about it. For example, at that time there was but one mosque existing in England, in Woking, Surrey, which was built in Victorian for political reasons.<br/>
And no reasonable person can say that either the USA or the UK are &#8216;better&rsquo; more accomplished, more orderly, more peaceful, more cohesive, more inventive or more industrious nations in 2014 than they were in 1945. In fact by all measures society is far far worse.<br/>
A very reasonable suggesting, that I profoundly agree with is that according to the old Islamic demarcation, the world should be divided up into a Muslim zone - &#8216;the house of peace&rsquo; and a non Muslim zone - &#8216;the house of war&rsquo;. The west must come to an arrangement with the Muslim world to impose this demarcation and impose it absolutely. This means that the west must make a binding agreement NEVER to interfere again in the affairs of Muslim nations, and all kaffirs must remove themselves from Muslim lands. In return the west must force ALL Muslims living on kaffir soil to go back home to the &#8216;house of peace&rsquo;. The price of this settlement will be that a mutually agreed non-aggression pact will exist between kaffirland and muslimland.<br/>
It&rsquo;s a very very sensible, good and reasonable suggestion. So of course the White western political class will reject it out of hand.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-619126" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have the following to say about this subject :</p>
<p>1) Non-White people should not be allowed to immigrate into White countries regardless whether they integrate or assimilate well or not. They are a threat to our identity, that should be reason enough to refuse them.</p>
<p>2) Muslims do not fit into any non-Muslim society ( Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, whatever). It is simply in the DNA of their relgion to spread its faith and impose its sharia by force. Therefore there is no &#8220;moderate&#8221; Islam. Muslim fanatics have not &#8220;hijacked&#8221; Islam, they are its consistent practitioners.</p>
<p>3) Having said this, many Muslim &#8220;terrorist attacks&#8221; are false flag operations, done to justify attacks on Muslim countries for the benefit of American imperialism and Israel&rsquo;s security.</p>
<p>4) The destruction of Iraq alone has caused far more suffering to Muslims than all crimes committed by Muslims in all Western countries combined.</p>
<p>5) It is therefore hypocritical to complain about Muslim crimes, while condoning attacks on Muslim countries. Fanatical or not, Muslims are also human beings and their human rights should also be respected and that means no more attacks on their countries and henceforth no more &#8220;false flags&#8221; blamed on them. Morality cuts both ways.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-619166" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&hellip;&#8221;Islam has caused tremendous destruction. Yet it gives believers a sense<br/>
of commitment that has no parallel in the West. Viewed objectively–and<br/>
setting aside, if that is possible, the immense suffering it has<br/>
caused–Muslim dedication is a refreshing contrast to the aimlessness of<br/>
so many Americans and Europeans&#8221;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Although the whole article is a good one, the last paragraph or two particularly chimed with me. I know what it is like to live in town (and in a region) that is highly infiltrated with Muslims, and the author is correct to make this observation.</p>
<p>Whether they are delusional, fanatical, every-day folks, educated, uneducated, there is a great sense in these kinds of areas that they have an organisational advantage as a &#8216;minority&rsquo; grouplet - with a common set of aims, even if different sects do not always agree. </p>
<p>They strategically expand into areas. They strategically set up their stall to build for the future. </p>
<p>They have franchises and Islamic commitment to donate a part of their business turnover to the mosque, who may then go on to buy land or old buildings to turn into a Muslim school. When they plan for new mosques, they are often thinking 15, 20, 30 years down the line in terms of ultimate capacity.</p>
<p>It feels like they have a vision and an ambition (through their devotion to Islamic structures) for the future&hellip;.. whereas all the whites in this town, including myself to some degree, seem to feel like there is no future and the general public and institutions are NOT setting out a future for whites. There is no goal, no ambitions, no visions. </p>
<p>In fact, in general terms, everything the wider public and institutions do is &#8220;for everybody&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;whilst what the Muslims do is largely &#8220;for themselves&#8221;.</p>
<p>Clearly this is a disastrous way of being, particularly when demographics softly nudge what was once &#8220;everybody&rsquo;s&#8221; into being, in effect, &#8220;theirs&#8221;.</p>
<p>Take for example some of the &#8220;super-schools&#8221; they built in my area. They pulled down three perfectly good high-schools because they were too segregated and wanted to move to create a &#8220;catchment area&#8221; that would mix up the schools. </p>
<p>Millions of pounds were spent on this project, with PFI schemes that I think we are all still paying for and will be paying for for the next 30 years or more.</p>
<p>The aim was to get a 50/50 Mix of Asians(Pakistanis) and Whites&hellip;&hellip;.yet about a decade down the line from when they were built, some of them are already 75% or more Pakistani Muslim again. This is simple demographic mathematics. Pretty soon, they will have &#8220;inherited&#8221; a fancy new school for themselves that the whites have largely paid for.</p>
<p>I can only tell you that when one sector of society is working towards a plan and expanding, whilst the other just plods along individually, flapping in the wind and has no plan, it is NOT all that hard to work out which will come out on top.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-619641" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>To Mike, whose comment has been recently removed, perhaps you&rsquo;re right. Maybe I ought to change my moniker as part of the wider shame that has befallen Britain.</p>
<p>I<br/>
took it up when I was quite active in the British National Party about a<br/>
decade ago, where I would be helping table top stalls, leafleting,<br/>
attending meetings and demonstrations, supporting local hustings<br/>
candidates, making videos, trying to win over support and stake our case<br/>
in the comment sections of newspapers, blogs, forums. You should<br/>
know what has happened here since then. </p>
<p>I was once fairly active, but now not so much. You see, there is no point in &#8220;growing a pair&#8221;<br/>
when you are largely on your own with a completely broken and<br/>
ineffectual British Nationalist movement that doesn&rsquo;t seem to know it&rsquo;s<br/>
arse from its elbow. </p>
<p>This especially so in a wider nation that doesn&rsquo;t seem to give<br/>
much of a damn and, in the case of England, is already minority white in three to four major cities already and many smaller towns are reaching 20%, 30% of &#8216;enrichment&rsquo;. </p>
<p>I personally have not &#8220;allowed&#8221; us to be overrun,<br/>
for the seeds of that already happened before I was even born - never<br/>
mind came of age enough to realise what was going on and what it meant.</p>
<p>But<br/>
yes, the wider British people have indeed &#8220;drifted&#8221; to this point. This<br/>
is through cowardice, ignorance, selfishness, being brainwashed, being<br/>
lied to, and having their own sense of identity smashed up.</p>
<p>I cannot<br/>
argue that the British should have &#8216;respect&rsquo; - for I cannot &#8216;respect&rsquo;<br/>
what has led to this position either.</p>
<p>Given the state things are<br/>
in, I would really like to know what will be &#8220;effectual&#8221; and thoroughly<br/>
feasible to turn this state of affairs around. If you knew (or know)<br/>
what the attitude and atmosphere is like in Britain, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d<br/>
be so quick to say that all is required is to &#8220;grow a pair&#8221;. Then<br/>
what? The answer has seemed to allude many nations in Europe, for we<br/>
are not alone in this predicament. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right to be critical<br/>
and condemning - but if you are American, I don&rsquo;t see much success in<br/>
keeping America white either, and nor do I see that many Americans<br/>
&#8220;growing a pair&#8221; collectively to rise up and do something about<br/>
it&hellip;&hellip;.and that is even when you have the right to bear arms and<br/>
overthrow your government for going against the interests of America.</p>
<p>Tough talk is easy. Securing lasting results in a nation that has lost the will to live, well that is another matter.</p>

<p>However, as bad as they are they&rsquo;re no worse than blacks. The crime and violence from blacks, the constant black on white mob attacks, the thousands of black on white murders, assaults and rapes, and the dumbing down of our schools, because they can&rsquo;t learn, and the myriad of other problems they cause with their constant complaining about one thing after another, because they can&rsquo;t really achieve anything on their own and want to blame their failures on something or someone other than them selves, all constitute an ongoing tumultuous upheaval in our society.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism has been a disaster for this country. It has weakened us horribly, especially from Muslims and blacks, and now the growing inundation of illegal aliens pouring into the country unchecked.</p>
<p>There has been no outside enemy that has posed a greater threat to this country than diversity. None.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s now impossible to get rid of any of them even if they&rsquo;re here illegally. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the last days of the Roman Empire. There&rsquo;s no way to stop it. This country will not continue on as a sovereign entity in its present form. It&rsquo;s too late.</p>

What I found disturbing is that the Fed police could arrest an American citizen who had not committed any crime except exercise his his rights of freedom of communication and association. </p>
<p>Sure MCain is a thug, and White men are better off if he is incarcerated. But consider the precedents that are being set for arresting people because of their opinions, and the Liberals are skilled at establishing precedents. Today the Feds arrest Islamic militants traveling to the Mideast; tomorrow it could be non-Liberal White men with Politically incorrect material stored on their computers.</p>

Most intelligent White race realists in the. United States like Pat Buchanan strongly opposed these Neo Conservative USA wars in Iraq, going back to 1991. </p>
<p>I personally took out full page advertisements in the Nashville Tennessean and Chatanooga Times opposing the first Bush Sr. War against secular Iraq, I quoted George Washington and Charles Lindbergh arguing that the. United States should pursue a neutral pro American foreign policy, as well as a pro American immigration policy.</p>
<p>Pro White, race realists here and most everywhere do not support endless USA wars in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Understand we get called &#8220;RACIST&#8221;, NAZIs for being peace activists in the ME, same as we get called RACIST, NAZIs for publicly opposing mass 3rd World Muslim immigration in to the USA, the West.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just life and there is nothing fair about this.</p>
<p>Also, please understand that third world Arabs, Paki, &#8220;Stan&#8221; Muslims are the way they are, the way they have always been. When Whites show weakness, tolerance, bend over backwards to take the non White, Arab/Black Muslim side, the Muslims see this as weakness, decadence same as they see White Western tolerance for feminism, open homosexual extremism. When Arab, Black, Paki Muslims see Western Whites acting weak and decadent they attack, resort to 8th century barbarism, </p>

The most important Muslim strategic weapon, by far, is the fact that well over 90% of automobiles are unable to run on any fuel not derived from oil. Over 78% of the world&rsquo;s commercially recoverable oil reserves lie within OPEC nations, with nearly all of the cheapest to extract, easiest to refine, most-wanted stuff; light sweet crude in the Mideast specifically. Meanwhile we have less than 2% of the world&rsquo;s oil reserves, COUNTING Arctic and offshore. Getting higher mileage is useless and &#8220;Drill Baby Drill&#8221; is a feel good fairy tale because they can cut production to match any increase in US production or fall in US demand to keep the price propped up, and the rest of us funding jihad propaganda, terror groups, and WMD and ballistic missile programs. The only way out of the oil trap is to break free from oil.</p>
<p>Use ethanol, bio-diesel, electricity, or compressed natural gas to move your vehicle, NOT gasoline or diesel. If your car can&rsquo;t use any of them, get one that can. Check OnlyDriveGreen dot com and check the &#8220;Find Your Car&#8221; dropmenus on the left. No you DON&rsquo;T have to get a dinky slow flimsy little car. There are fast, big, robust, powerful vehicles from big brand manufacturers out there. And do NOT choose &#8220;Hybrid&#8221; or &#8220;High MPG&#8221; - that keeps you locked in to oil fuel - and remember, they can just spike up the price to make sure you keep paying just as much each month and each year despite needing less fuel to go the same distance. </p>
<p>Most homeowners have an electric outlet in their garage to charge up an electric vehicle, or a plug-in hybrid. And there are over 2,300 filling stations that have a pump selling E85 ethanol (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Oil is jihad juice. Everything else is domestic.</p>

<p>So in combination of &#8216;real world on the ground&rsquo; shifting of ownership of this country, combined with a bit of a wing and a prayer to softly push the ever elderly white electorate back to some milder form of nationalism&hellip;.. I cannot really be all that optimistic about it.</p>
<p>The recent statements by the newly elected MP for UKIP, the murmours of more Conservatives jumping the sinking Tory Ship, the meetings with Rupert Murdoch&hellip;..I am cynical that the establishment elements will just leak into UKIP and carry on business as usual. </p>
<p>In fact, Douglas Carswell may well be part of a neutralisation team that, as toby young of the telegraph stated, would &#8220;drag UKIP into the 21st century&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-624377" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I completely agree. That is one of the best arguments for race-based states.</p>
<p>Let me share a personal story. I actually had a European American friend (Anglo Saxon ancestry), let&rsquo;s call him Michael, who was raised in a conservative Protestant family but later converted to Islam as an adult. Michael didn&rsquo;t change in the slightest. I mean, yes, he would sometimes pause whatever he&rsquo;s doing to go wash his face and pray to his God. But his character, interests, and love for his family and community did not change at all. Did I find it strange that he converted to Islam? Of course!</p>
<p>But he continued to be good friend and it quickly became clear to be me that what people believe about hypothetical sky Gods does not affect their personality. Religion is not in our DNA; it doesn&rsquo;t change our biological programming. I&rsquo;ve known many Mormons who I consider very upright people who still believe in marriage and family and they have many White children. Mormons are unwittingly helping to keep the White race growing here in the US.</p>
<p>Religion, no matter how bizarre or untrue (have you read the Book of Mormon?) can do a lot of good (not just harm), by giving people some basic cultural guidance, group cohesion, and meaning that I feel is lacking in our postmodern, secular, individualistic Western societies. This is my (limited) perception.</p>

I think all muslims should be repatriated and here is why<br/>
1) accouring to Norwegian figures a 3.world lives a deficit 1.1 mio dollar in a life time<br/>
2) In the UK 50% of male and 75% are on benefits. The figure is the same in the rest of Europe<br/>
3) muslims crime rates are up 300-500% higher than the normal population -in diffrent types of crimes<br/>
4) They are extremely highly supremacist and etnocentristic. Jews in Denmark and the rest of Europe fells their hate and many wants to migrate to Israel but also other minorities like homosexuals, Christians of decent in middeleast and other minorities.<br/>
5) A disrespct of any officials from the state or people in uniform; police, bus drives,teachers<br/>
are regularly challenge by provocation. Soldiers in Denmark and the rest of Europe can not wear uniforms outside -without risk of attack.<br/>
6) 9/11 and 7/7 in London and Madrid was carried out by muslims migrants in the West- a the whole war on terror is a by product of muslims in the west -the deluded liberals to bring democracy to a tribal culture with Islam will not cure them but make it worse<br/>
There is nothing the muslims have given the west that is positive -only problem. If you tolerate them more will come - there is everything to win by showing total intolerance toward them</p>
