<div class="intro-paragraph">
Will another conservative book make a difference?</div> 
</div> 



<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jason L. Riley, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Please-Stop-Helping-Us-Liberals/dp/1594037256">Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed</a></em>, Encounter Books, 2014, 184 pp., $23.99.</strong></p>
<p>Jason Riley, who has been a member of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> editorial board since 2005, is the latest to join Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele, and Walter Williams as an eloquent black opponent of the theory that racism explains why blacks fail. In <em>Please Stop Helping Us</em>, he argues that liberal uplift is what most damages blacks. It has convinced them that they are hapless victims whose salvation will come only when whites are purged of all traces of &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; &ldquo;Today,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;there is no greater impediment to black advancement than the self-pitying mindset that permeates black culture.&rdquo; There may not be a single new idea in this book, but it is concise, quotable, and in many respects irrefutable.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/StopHelping.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-111331" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/StopHelping.jpg" alt="StopHelping" width="337" height="500" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/StopHelping.jpg 337w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/StopHelping-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px"/></a></p>
<p>Mr. Riley believes that blacks would be better off if whites left them alone rather than keep trying to help them. He quotes Frederick Douglass&rsquo;s remarkable exhortation from 1865:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;What should we do with the Negro?&rsquo; is what everyone asks. &#8216;Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us! . . . [I]f the Negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall . . . .&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Douglass view-that black success depends on blacks-prevailed until about the middle of the 20th century. Booker T. Washington, a former slave, gained national attention with his famous Atlanta speech of 1895, in which he urged blacks not to make demands on whites but to gain their respect through hard work. Andrew Carnegie called Washington the second father of his country, and Harvard and Dartmouth gave him honorary degrees. In 1956, in commemoration of the centennial of Washington&rsquo;s birth, President Eisenhower dedicated a national memorial to the black leader.</p>
<p>As Mr. Riley notes, however, it was the views of Washington&rsquo;s great rival, W.E.B. Du Bois, that prevailed. After Washington&rsquo;s death in 1915, the self-help movement never produced a similarly great black spokesman (Marcus Garvey&rsquo;s colorful career ended in jail time and deportation), and Du Bois convinced increasing numbers of whites that it was they-not blacks-who were responsible for black behavior.</p>
<p>Mr. Riley explains that this is now virtually dogma:</p>
<blockquote><p>Several generations of blacks have come to believe that the only legitimate means of group progress is political agitation of the NAACP-Jesse Jackson-Al Sharpton variety. If you are more interested in black self-development than in keeping whites on the defensive, you&rsquo;re accommodating racism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another part of the dogma is the belief that winning political power is essential for black economic progress-another view Du Bois pushed. Blacks, therefore, vote overwhelmingly for black candidates, even though they don&rsquo;t much care what those candidates do once they are elected.</p>

Du Bois</p></div>
<p>Mr. Riley points to the Obama presidency as an example. When Mr. Obama took office for his first term, the unemployment rate was 12.7 percent for blacks, and 7.1 percent for whites. On Election Day, 2012, the black rate had increased to 14.3 percent while it had dropped slightly to 7 percent for whites. Despite this deterioration for blacks, Mr. Obama still got 93 percent of the black vote. As one black politician once explained to Carol Swain of Vanderbilt University, blacks care so little about what their politicians do that &ldquo;you can almost get away with raping babies and be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many elected blacks openly flout the desires of their constituents. White Democrats, who are the institutional framework for black political success, favor Mexican immigration, marriage for homosexuals, and light prison sentences, for example, so black politicians favor these things, too, even though ordinary blacks oppose them.</p>
<p>In any case, Mr. Riley points out that holding office makes little difference to whether an ethnic group gets ahead. The Irish were masters of city-machine politics, but aside from a few patronage jobs, it did not make them rich. Likewise, Asians have the highest incomes in America despite being nearly invisible in politics.</p>
<p>Black &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; nevertheless seem to be terrified that whites will, first, never vote for blacks, and, second, want to take the vote away from them. Mr. Riley notes that in 2008, Mr. Obama got more white votes in such &ldquo;racist&rdquo; states as Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia than John Kerry did in 2004 or Al Gore in 2000. He also laughs at the spectacle of the black attorney general of a black president fretting that voter ID laws are passed to disfranchise blacks.</p>
<p><strong>Welfare and degeneracy</strong></p>
<p>One of the classic conservative arguments against welfare is that it rewards degeneracy. Mr. Riley writes that &ldquo;upward mobility depends on work and family,&rdquo; but that at the same time, &ldquo;Social welfare programs that were initiated or greatly expanded during the 1960s resulted in the government effectively displacing black fathers as breadwinners and made work less attractive.&rdquo; As he notes in one of his better lines, &ldquo;Having a black man in the Oval Office is less important than having one in the home.&rdquo; Welfare is one of the best examples of liberal &ldquo;help&rdquo; that harms blacks.</p>
<p>Until the 1960s, blacks tended to value the qualities that bring success: diligence, politeness, marriage, education, reliability, proper speech, etc. Now, for many blacks, this is &ldquo;acting white.&rdquo; Mr. Riley writes that he has put up with this for most of his life, and that even his nine-year-old niece once asked, &ldquo;Why you talk white, Uncle Jason? Why he trying to sound so smart?&rdquo; He notes that black rappers have even bragged about subverting middle-class aspirations. Chuck D says that &ldquo;rappers came in the game and threw that confusing element in it, and kids are like, Yo, fuck this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Riley points out that employers prefer to hire people who &ldquo;act white:&rdquo; &ldquo;The persistently high black jobless rate is more a consequence of unemployablity than of discrimination in hiring.&rdquo; One of the great achievements of liberal excuse-making is to have shifted the blame for black fecklessness onto &ldquo;society,&rdquo; which is another way of blaming whites. But the effect, in Mr. Riley&rsquo;s view, is that &ldquo;blacks have become their own worst enemy&rdquo; by believing that their own actions are less important than the attitudes of whites.</p>
<p><strong>Crime</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The black inmate population reflects black criminality, not a racist criminal justice system,&rdquo; Mr. Riley explains with refreshing bluntness. He is appalled by liberals who write about black inmates as if they were innocent men who have been herded into prison by brutal white policemen. The press repeatedly shies away from the truth about black crime, and until the country faces the truth, nothing sensible will be said or done about it.</p>
<p>Much of the liberal frenzy over crime is just noise. Laws that punished possession of crack cocaine more severely than possession of powder have offered endless opportunities for self-righteous preening, but Mr. Riley points out that it was blacks who were clamoring for stiff sentences to stop a plague that was destroying whole neighborhoods. Eleven black congressmen voted for the 1986 law, and no one at the time argued that it was a &ldquo;racist&rdquo; snare for black men.</p>
<p>Likewise, after George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin, there was a tremendous racket over Florida&rsquo;s Stand Your Ground justification for self-defense killings-despite the fact that Stand Your Ground was not even part of the case. Mr. Riley points out that although blacks are just 16.6 percent of the population of Florida, they account for 31 percent of Stand-Your-Ground defenses and are slightly more likely than whites to be successful with such a defense.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum wage and racial preferences</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Riley also has a good discussion of how raising the minimum wage hurts entry-level workers, especially blacks. He explains that many early minimum-wage laws, both state and federal, were passed to keep blacks from undercutting white workers. If employers had to pay a relatively high rate, they might as well hire whites rather than less-skilled blacks who might have been willing to work for less.</p>
<p>The most notorious anti-black wage law was the federal Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, which is still on the books. It requires contractors to pay &ldquo;prevailing wages,&rdquo; which is usually interpreted as union wages. Many unions kept out blacks and even today, blacks are less likely than whites to have union skills. Following the law shuts out low-skill workers, many of whom are black.</p>
<p>As Mr. Riley explains, &ldquo;When the government mandates that an employer pay someone more than the employer thinks the person is worth, fewer people get hired.&rdquo; Young blacks are at the bottom of the labor market, and are often the people who aren&rsquo;t hired or are the first to be fired.</p>
<p>Mr. Riley cites a study of the effect of the 41-percent rise in the minimum wage that took place in stages from 2007 to 2009-during the start of the recession. Twenty-one states had a minimum wage that was lower than the federal wage, so their labor markets felt the full effect of the increase. In those states, an estimated 18,500 young blacks lost their jobs because of the increase in the minimum wage. By contrast, only an estimated 13,200 young blacks lost work because of the downturn.</p>
<p>The dark vision of millions of hard-working Americans trying to raise a family on the minimum wage is a myth. First, only 5 percent of hourly wage earners make the minimum wage. Sixty-nine percent of that 5 percent work part time, and most are age 25 or younger. They are almost never the sole bread-winner for a family, and only 11.3 percent of minimum-wage workers even live in poor households. They are usually working to supplement incomes that are above the poverty level.</p>
<p>However, minimum-wage jobs are important, especially for poorly educated blacks, because any job is a start on the employment ladder. Having work experience of any kind is better than having none, and blacks are not helped by laws that price them out of a job.</p>
<p>Mr. Riley attacks racial preferences from the usual angles: They help better-off blacks rather than the poor, they push blacks past their level of competence so they are more likely to fail, they taint the achievements of blacks who could make it on their own, they make blacks lazy, and they infuriate whites. According to one source, in 2011 there were no fewer than 276 federal laws that granted racial preferences. Mr. Riley would abolish them all.</p>
<p>Mr. Riley cites a study at Duke University, where standards are drastically lowered to admit blacks. Of the male students who came to Duke expecting to major in the sciences, more than half of the blacks switched to an easier major, whereas only 8 percent of the whites did. The study concluded that if the blacks had been at less demanding schools they might have stuck with science.</p>
<p>Preferences have had little effect on black poverty. In 1940, the black poverty rate was 87 percent. By 1960, without any help from preferences, it had dropped to 47 percent. In 1990 after 25 years of racial preferences, 32 percent of blacks were still poor.</p>
<p><strong>Ineffectual?</strong></p>
<p><em>Please Stop Helping Us</em> makes excellent arguments and has the added advantage of being written by a black. But will it change anyone&rsquo;s mind? I don&rsquo;t think conventionally conservative books have much impact. These arguments have been made over and over. Most of the people who read this book will agree with it already, and the few doubters who pick it up will not be swayed.</p>
<p>I suspect it takes special circumstances for a book with no new ideas to change anyone&rsquo;s mind. It would have to reach someone who was groping his way towards a more sensible view and would probably have got there-though a little later-without Mr. Riley&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>This book would have had a greater impact if Mr. Riley had taken the plunge into race differences in IQ. Does Mr. Riley really believe that if blacks shake off their self-pity-and whites stop helping them-that the performance gap will disappear? Does any conventional conservative really believe that?</p>
<p>So far, no mainstream black author has ever explained the genetic basis for racial differences. If one were brave enough to do so and lucky enough to find a publisher, he might make a terrific stink that could nudge the debate an inch or two towards sanity. Recirculating ideas-even good ideas-that date back to <em>Paved With Good Intentions</em> (1992) and <em>Losing Ground</em> (1984) isn&rsquo;t likely to have much effect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, thanks to this book, Mr. Riley is being invited onto television programs, where he is able to talk sense to the huge majority of Americans who never read books. This will do some good.</p>
<p>But the larger question is one Mr. Riley does not raise. Which is more important for liberals: helping blacks or appearing virtuous? I suspect it may be the latter. The right attitude toward minorities is the <em>sine qua non</em> for respectability, and I think most white liberals would rather see blacks stuck in the underclass than cease to be respectable. The desire to appear virtuous is so strong it blinds them to facts.</p>
<p>That is why a university diversity officer literally cannot see that his affirmative-action pets are dropping out and should have gone to community college. His sense of virtue requires a certain number of blacks on campus even if they are desperately over their heads.</p>
<p>Liberal blindness drives most social policy in America, especially race policy. So far, no cure has been discovered.</p>

<p>This problem is intractable. The race gap will always exist because it is primarily genetic. Liberals have only made the problem worse by fostering a mindset of victimhood, entitlement and racial animus on the negroes leaving them dependent, feckless, amoral and unable to accept the consequences of their actions (or inaction). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the white man has suffered from increasingly racist, black crime, discrimination in education and employment, the massive curtailments of free speech and association, and an ever increasing tax burden to subsidise a feral, degenerate, uneducable black underclass.</p>
<p>Secession, segregation or sterilisation of the white man&rsquo;s burden are the only practicable options I see to end this nightmare.</p>

The circumstances themselves will force a conclusion. The situation is untenable and will collapse into chaos without intervention. The proposed remedies on Amren are meant to be that intervention. If they&rsquo;re unlikely to be adopted now, will they still be unlikely as the chaos grows expontentially? Will there be a sweet spot where we gain the will to act, and still have the ability to act? That&rsquo;s the $64,000 Question. Soon there will be no place where whites can flee. A conclusion, good or bad, is coming.</p>

We can&rsquo;t even publicly make the case that somewhere, whites should have the right to live amongst ourselves right now.

In the U.S. Blacks are treated like victims giving them a leg up on everyone including poor whites. Without affirmative action the black race dies like the dinosaurs. But the poor blacks in the U.S. had ancestors with disadvantaged backgrounds that is why they need the boost right? Oh right so that is why they dominate sports but weren&rsquo;t allowed to participate before and that is why Hispanics who were never victims are still given preferential treatment. Why don&rsquo;t you just say it Mr. Obama, YOU WANT WHITE GENOCIDE and when you are finished destroying the white race and the country is destroyed by your own, you will blame whites for letting you destroy it. Then you will gather every last one of us still here and have us rebuild the country before you people destroy it yet again</p>

But still the one most damaging idea that liberals have ever pushed and is the most dangerous, is this: That all races are equal. On the service that sounds reasonable. But think. If all races are equal (And there is zero evidence they are.) then any disparity must be due to some sort of &#8220;unfairness&#8221; in &#8220;the system.&#8221; That inevitably leads to countless attempts by Whites to &#8220;help&#8221; the group that is &#8220;disadvantaged.&#8221; We need to get rid of that idea and truly accept our differences. Then we can have a fair and just society.</p>

<p>Just think it through, it is impossible for whites (who possess the highest genetic material on this planet) to have evolved from blacks. The environment enhances what is already there. The environment cannot change inferior (black) genes to superior genes. This country spent trillions in trying to bring black genes to the same level as whites = all failures.

The other stayed behind, and was separated from the rest of humanity for tens of thousands of years. These became Negroes, or if you prefer, blacks.

The whites are the most resistant and intelligent toward being controlled. So, my point is, if the brainwashing propaganda is that humanity evolved from blacks so what&rsquo;s the big deal in breeding with them? After all, race is just a social construct and we are all one, just differences in skin color nothing else. And to put the final nail in the coffin, the whites are ever increasing as the minority = increasing loss of political power to make decisions that would benefit them.</p>

<p>Just to add more twist here, humanity on this planet evolved from the Eskimos. The Eskimos evolved from primates some 1 million years ago during the Ice Age. But the white gene pool is unique as it is not completely evolutionary.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-613907" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Stan D Mute, take out the &#8220;may&#8221;: Africans have continued to mate with African hominids while those who left Africa didn&rsquo;t. So beside the Neanderthal DNA that Africans don&rsquo;t have, we indeed don&rsquo;t have some of their DNA they acquired after we left:</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2011 Michael Hammer et al. at the University of Arizona studied DNA from two African hunter-gatherer groups, the Biaka Pygmies, the San and the West African agricultural Mandinka people. They concluded that roughly 2% of the genetic material found in these modern African populations was inserted into the human genome approximately 35,000 years ago. They also concluded these sequences must have come from a now-extinct member of the Homo genus that broke away from the modern human lineage around 700,000 years ago.[42]&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2012 another study wasdone by Sarah Tishkoff et al. at the University of Pennsylvania. They tested 3 sub-Saharan African populations - Pygmies from Cameroon and the Hadza and Sandawe, both from Tanzania. The team found signs that the<br/>
ancestors of the hunter-gatherers bred with different species of<br/>
hominins, probably more than 40,000 years ago.[43]&#8221;<br/>
From en(dot)wikipedia(dot)org/wiki/Archaic_human_admixture_with_modern_Homo_sapiens</p>
<p>  &mdash;  </p>
<p>If I understand the following article correctly, there were still living hominids 2000 years ago. I am not sure mating was possible with those specific hominids but with others earlier in time it was (I sent the following article to Amren but they didn&rsquo;t publish it). After all the races were separated for 50000 and mating is still possible (I always wonder if there were or are Australoids and Negroids couple and children, if so they were separated 70 000 and are the furthest races apart):</p>
<p>phys org/news/2014-09-ancient-human-genome-southern-africa html<br/>
&#8220;What can DNA from the skeleton of a man who lived 2,330 years ago in the southernmost tip of Africa tell us about ourselves as humans? A great deal when his DNA profile is one of the &#8216;earliest diverged&rsquo; – oldest in genetic terms – found to-date in a region where modern humans are believed to have originated roughly 200,000 years ago.&#8221;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-613368" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Maybe natural selection is simply too complex an idea for many whites. After all, half of white people have an IQ below 100. The notion that &#8220;whites are descended from Africans&#8221; is a simpleton&rsquo;s understanding of the situation. As you note, the &#8220;out of Africa&#8221; theory is just that - a theory propounded by folks who discovered some bones and wanted to make a big name for themselves. The genetics tell us that there is between 50,000-100,000 (or more) years distance between Europeans and Africans and that we have some Neanderthal genes while Asians have some Denisovan genes. How that happened we don&rsquo;t yet know. And for practical purposes it doesn&rsquo;t really matter <i>how</i>. What is important is simply that we are enormously different and nobody knows what the long term result of any mixing might be. Certainly mixing now radically alters tens of thousands of years of evolution. What we should focus on is continuing the path that got us where we are today, maintaining the differences and improving each population as much as can be done. Stirring a pot that&rsquo;s been separated 100,000 years makes as much sense as breeding lions and tigers together, forever destroying both lions and tigers to create what in their place. And maybe even that is more than our dimmer brethren can grasp.</p>

The evolution of the different races is entirely different from a unicellular organism to a complex one. You are comparing apples to oranges. Modern man can never know how the different races came about. He was not there at the time of the event. Suppose you are referring to the theory that blacks are the ancestor of all humanity so you buy into that whites/Asians, etc evolved from blacks. Again, it is just a theory not a fact. This theory as mentioned earlier was primarily due to the Leakeys. </p>
<p> And yes, I do present narratives that are outside of the box of commonly accepted dogma. Man is still discovering the evidence of events that transpired eons ago on this planet. Some events he will never be able to discover as trying to find &ldquo;missing links&rdquo; because there were none. Evolution can occur in sudden jumps (not classified as a mutation). This theory was presented early in the 1900&rsquo;s but it was discarded in favored of the &ldquo;missing links&rdquo; theory.</p>

You actually claimed whites couldn&rsquo;t have evolved from blacks because a superior one can&rsquo;t evolve from a lower one, but that happens all the time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe whites evolved from blacks either, but that&rsquo;s because our LCA wasn&rsquo;t the same as modern day &#8220;blacks&#8221;- they&rsquo;ve gone down their own divergent path and look different (and differ genetically) from humans back then. At the same time, I don&rsquo;t buy into pure OOA, we have clearly interbred at various points with other earlier humans and that is indisputably a mainstream belief at this point, but I do think most evidence points to the fact our lineage ultimately originates in africa. Time will tell, but I&rsquo;m not partial to something like we all evolved from inuits or non-whites come from India or whatever you&rsquo;ve come up with.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-615467" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Read my prior post again regarding unicellular to complex organisms in how it relates to the different races. Blacks in this country have more white DNA in them due to interracial breeding than say blacks in Africa but yet still at the bottom of the barrel needing great social handouts. Whereas, Asians do not need<br/>
the handouts because they have a different set of genome that enables them to compete with the whites on their own.<br/>
The Asians can barely speak the language nor of the white culture but yet do very well economically and academically.<br/>
So there goes your social dogma. Once again, each of the colored races appeared with their own set of racial genome as is. Yes, the different races can interbred which they have done so throughout the eons. But superior genes become diluted from<br/>
breeding with inferior genes. Unfortunately, when this fact is pointed out, it is now considered racism or scientific racism to shut it down.</p>
<p>Man did evolve from the primitive to the complex but the scientific dogma cannot completely apply to the evolution of man. Once, man was able to distinguish right from wrong along with free will, wisdom, and worship, all which set his path toward evolving to something higher than an animal. And, countless Sumerian clay tablets are sitting on dusty museum shelves. Those elaborate tablets would disclose another angle of man&rsquo;s evolution on this planet. Those tablets would explain the reasons why the Sumerians all of sudden appeared with writing, the arts, agriculture, pottery, weaving, etc., etc. This knowledge was not gotten by natural evolution. </p>
<p> No, superior genes cannot come from inferior genes. Man early on recognized this fact. This was one of the main reasons for the installation of the caste system in India. Yes, I know, to leap<br/>
over the hurdles of dogma whether scientific or religion takes great mental effort and courage. And the narratives, I present certainly goes outside the box of dogma which you find all strange. There is very much more for man to learn and discover regarding his past and future. Physics is constantly striving to learn more of the existence of matter which will lead more and more into the mystery of the universe/cosmos itself.</p>

The ancient Egyptians also knew of this advanced civilization which they called Dilmat of which the original name was Dalamatia.

They had encounters with Adam and Eve and their descendant which they regarded as an alien race! (Because the Sumerians were still living on their past glory). So you see the DNA of present man is both evolutionary and not.<br/>
And there is more to this fascinating story. The Middle East especially around Iran and Iraq still holds much historical artifacts yet to be discovered. The advanced massive ancient civilzation of Adam and Eve and their descendants has to be discovered.</p>

<p>First off, people will never indefinitely tolerate seeing a group within their society locked in such permanent underclass, failure-prone status. Since they are genetically different in ways which make this status (relative to other groups) an inevitability, this condition relative to whites or whoever they&rsquo;re living among, will always be a fact of life.</p>
<p>So people will always get around to trying to mettle in it and fix it somehow. At least as long as society is prosperous and people are disconnected from the demands of survival, and have a lot of time on their hands.</p>
<p>The problem is the presence of the black genome in our societies. As long as it has such direct exposure to our genome, it will always pose a massive problem. It will seek to better itself by mixing with our genome, it will make us miserable, depressed and on edge by threatening our control of our own society and making our streets unsafe, and constantly hollering at us about our &#8220;privilege&#8221; etc.</p>

White veterans of the war in Iraq, white homeless in every large city in the country, the 1 million white men in prison, the millions of whites that grow up as racial minorities, whites on pyschotropic drugs, who would likely be in mental institutions if that practices hadn&rsquo;t been abandoned during the 1980&rsquo;s, even white orphans are seen as privileged over and above the middle and upper middle class blacks whose grandparents benefited from affirmative action and racial advocacy (as they do also). </p>
<p>For whites, race doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist except for the history, the current, and the forever projected into the future scourge of white racism, malfeasance and advantage.

Even if there were zero Asians, Hispanics or Muslims in the U.S. we would still have 95% of our race problems. Barring genetic engineering, blacks will always be the major source of problems for the U.S. And they are growing in numbers.</p>

<p>The expansion of the welfare system is only part of the reason for the decline in the black family. Another part has been the decline in reasonably well paying and largely unionized jobs that can be performed by men of average or slightly below average intelligence. </p>
<p>In his book &#8220;Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010,&#8221; Charles Murray documented an increase in social pathology among white male blue collar workers. </p>

<p>We KNOW that nothing will &#8220;fix&#8221; the negroes. We KNOW they won&rsquo;t give up their entitlements and that the Marxists won&rsquo;t stop stealing from us. No book will change that. But if this book begins the awakening of a few hundred or a few thousand white kids then its done more good than anything else I&rsquo;ve seen in quite a while.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-613738" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about how Blacks were doing better before the 60s than they are now. That is partially true. But their neighborhoods were still horrible places full of crime, drugs, violence and general sorriness. But two things tended to minimize the problems:</p>
<p>1. The police were extremely proactive in those neighborhoods and Blacks were properly frightened of the police. That&rsquo;s no longer true.</p>
<p>2. Before the 60s Blacks respected Whites and did their best to imitate Whites. Their imitation was more style than substance, but it did have some positive effects.</p>
<p>Now, of course, Blacks are taught to despise Whites. You can see this in their music. Before the 60s Blacks developed a salable version of White music. Now their music is essentially a little girl&rsquo;s jump rope song with an unending stream of obscenities attached.</p>
<p>If we leave Blacks alone, they won&rsquo;t change. They will continue to fail, and the &#8220;Black middle class&#8221; that is entirely dependent on affirmative action will cease to exist.</p>
<p>If we have Blacks and Hispanics in this country, we will continue to have a permanent criminal underclass. That is just a fact.</p>
<p>The only solution to the problem with Blacks is to deport them to Africa or Mexico along with ALL of the other nonWhite savages who have infested the U.S. in recent decades. Deport them ALL to Mexico because it&rsquo;s convenient for us and because Mexico has been our worst enemy for decades. Let them sort it out.</p>

<p>But you know what? We don&rsquo;t even need to go there to achieve some sort of sane equilibrium in this society. We can make a whole lot of positive change, even without going into any kind of IQ discussions, by following Riley&rsquo;s suggestions (for instance, of abolishing affirmative action. That alone can go a long way towards restoring healthy atmosphere in academia). </p>
<p>The inherent fairness of the idea of self-determination, autonomy and dealing with the consequences of your own behavior regardless of your racial background, carries enough weight that it can be an excellent starting point for rolling back the insanity of the last fifty years in America. No need to even go into genetics etc, just go back to the idea of basic fairness, equality before the law etc. - I&rsquo;d take that anytime. Anytime! That alone will take care of our racial problems here to a large extent. </p>

<p>Democrats have certainly exploited blacks. I agree with Dick Morris&rsquo; view that Dems want blacks, the white poor and immigrants to remain poor and dependent on government so they get their vote. The better the country does the more Republican it becomes.</p>
<p>Du Bois had the naive notion that we&rsquo;re all equal, and environment is the only difference. That if you just gave blacks a classical education, they would become a brilliant, leadership class! What a joke that is. The reality eventually set in that blacks can&rsquo;t compete with whites and Asians, they just don&rsquo;t have the genetic and mental horsepower for it. So blacks must be reliant on government handouts or they would have much less income and status in society.</p>

The Douglass view–that black success depends on blacks–prevailed until about the middle of the 20th century. </i> </p>
<p>I think the reason for this is plain to see. The Douglass view of blacks lifting themselves up by their own bootstraps was tried for nearly a hundred years, and it failed utterly in equalizing the races. This was, of course, due to blacks&rsquo; lower average IQ level, weaker work ethic, lower morality, and other intrinsic factors. </p>
<p>Seeing this, the liberals changed course and decided to try a different tactic, and this resulted in the &#8220;blame whitey&#8221; strategy in use today. I don&rsquo;t think the lefties are going to change this strategy un less they are forced to do so kicking and screaming, because the alternative Riley proposes has already been tried and has been shown to be an utter failure. </p>
<p>The only strategy left now is to admit that blacks will never be able to function at a level anywhere near equal to whites (and Asians), something that would strip liberal arguments of their power in dispossessing the white man. In other words, it won&rsquo;t happen until liberals are forced to do so.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-615096" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The state of black Americans today has a mixture of genetic and cultural causes. In the 1950s the white illegitimacy rate was 5% and the black illegitimacy rate was 20%. Today the white illegitimacy rate is higher than it was for blacks then, and the current black illegitimacy rate is over 70%. Similarly at all times blacks have had significantly higher crime rates than whites, but in the 1950s black crime rates were well below what that are now.</p>
<p>So if all the damn fool ideas of the left were undone we would definitely see an improvement in the state of black America, but they would still be behind whites.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hitler had a certain time to come to the stadium and a certain time to leave. It happened he had to leave before the victory ceremony after the 100 meters. But before he left I was on my way to a broadcast and passed near his box. He waved at me and I waved back. I think it was bad taste to criticize the &#8216;man of the hour&rsquo; in another country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hitler didn&rsquo;t snub me – it was FDR who snubbed me. The president didn&rsquo;t even send me a telegram.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe being called &#8220;just like Hitler&#8221; is a complement.</p>

Power-as Alinsky said-is the only prize and object of attainment. Everything today, especially &#8220;science&#8221; is bent, warped, and modified to accommodate the greatest power and the enrichment of the powerful. All of the doctrines taught today as nouveau interpretations of Reality-Critical Theory, Critical Race Theory, PostModernism, PostStructualism, and other &#8220;relativistic&#8221; doctrines have left generations of Whites without a cultural, spiritual reference that defines and guides them. Without continuity from blood and soil, reverence for ancestors, and affinity for one&rsquo;s race, there is no hope for Whites to withstand and resist the assaults against them, be it ideology or physical.</p>
