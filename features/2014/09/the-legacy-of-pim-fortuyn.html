<h1 class="title">The Legacy of Pim Fortuyn</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Eric Rembrandt, American Renaissance, September 19, 2014</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
The Dutch politician martyred for his beliefs.</div> 
</div> 



<blockquote><p>It is five minutes to midnight, not just in the Netherlands but in Europe. I stand with this country, which has been built up in six centuries. There is a goddamned fifth column in this country that wants to take us into the abyss. I tell them [foreigners], you can stay here, but you adapt. When I visit their neighborhoods they tell me Allah is great, that I am a dirty pig and the leader of the Christian Democrats is a Christian dog. The people are fed up with the soft approach of the ruling parties, which is the reason I have won many seats during the elections. Fine, then I will be murdered. But the problem will remain.   &mdash;   Pim Foruyn</p></blockquote>
<p>It has now been 12 years since the assassination of Pim Fortuyn, the flamboyant Dutch politician who was one of the first to break the taboo and call attention to the deadly threat of Muslim immigration. He was one of very few critics of mass immigration who was able to reach a broad audience, and the success of his movement broke down barriers that have never been fully rebuilt.</p>
<p>Fortuyn was born in 1948. In 1981 he received a doctorate in sociology at the University of Groningen, and for a time taught Marxist sociology at the same university. In 1990, Fortuyn moved to <a href="http://versbeton.nl/2012/05/waar-pim-komt-is-ruzie/">Rotterdam</a>, where he taught at Erasmus University. Although he was, himself, a leftist, he began to notice that the political landscape and media were completely dominated by what he called &#8220;the left-wing church.&#8221; He also saw first-hand the failures of multiculturalism in Rotterdam, which received large numbers of immigrants during the 1960s and 1970s, most of them Muslim.</p>
<p>In 1997, he wrote a book, <em>Against the Islamization of our Culture</em>, which shocked the country and established him as a prominent critic of immigration policy. He began to appear on Dutch television and in the newspaper, where he relentlessly criticizing the government and Islam. He was soon notorious for saying he wanted a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2501950/2001/09/21/Koude-oorlog-tegen-islam.dhtml">cold war</a>&rdquo; with Islam, which he called &ldquo;an extraordinary threat&rdquo; and &ldquo;a hostile religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was invited on talk shows, he was often treated like a lunatic, and was usually outnumbered by hostile opponents. However, Fortuyn, who was openly homosexual, had a suave debating style that often routed his opponents.</p>
<p>In one television debate, he flaunted his homosexuality at a Muslim cleric. When the imam responded with furious anti-homosexual invective, Fortuyn calmly explained to viewers that this is the kind of Trojan horse for intolerance the Dutch were letting into their country in the name of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>In 2001, the increasingly visible Fortuyn was put at the head of the new Livable Netherlands party&rsquo;s list of candidates, and was largely responsible for the party&rsquo;s success in the Rotterdam city elections. In February 2002, he gave an interview to a Dutch <a href="http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/Binnenland/article/detail/611698/2012/05/05/Pim-Fortuyn-op-herhaling-De-islam-is-een-achterlijke-cultuur.dhtml">newspaper</a>, <em>Volkskrant</em>, in which he said that Islam was &ldquo;a backward culture,&rdquo; and that if it were legally possible he would close Holland&rsquo;s borders to Muslims. He said Muslims had no understanding democracy or of the rights of women, homosexuals, or minorities, and that in sufficient numbers they would try to impose Sharia law on Holland. He added that it might be necessary to repeal anti-racism laws in order to protect freedom of speech.</p>
<p>This was too much for Livable Netherlands, and he was forced out of the party the day after the interview appeared. By then Fortuyn had bigger plans, and had his eye on the Dutch national elections. His criticism of traditional parties, immigration, multiculturalism, and Islam had attracted a large new group of voters, and with the help of several property magnates, he founded the <a href="http://www.parlement.com/id/vh8lnhrp1wzo/lijst_pim_fortuyn">Lijst Pim Fortuyn</a> (LPF).</p>
<p>The LPF quickly started polling at rates better than any other party. It attracted voters from the entire political spectrum, but especially from the Left. The same year, 2002, Fortuyn published another influential book, <em>The Wreckage of Eight Purple Years</em>. This was a powerful and well-received critique of the &#8220;purple&#8221; (conservative, liberal, and social democrat) governments that had been in power for almost a decade. If there had been an election when Fortuyn was at the peak of his popularity, he might well have become prime minister.</p>
<p>The establishment realized Fortuyn was a threat, and began a program of <a href="http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2779314/2002/05/11/De-demonisering-van-Pim-Fortuyn.dhtml">demonization</a>. He had been called &ldquo;right wing&rdquo; and &ldquo;racist,&rdquo; but he always rejected these labels. He insisted-sincerely, it appears-that he did not object to Muslims because of their race but because they were incapable of appreciating modernity, which Fortuyn defined in terms of the achievements of the Left. For this reason, he rejected any comparison to Jean-Marie Le Pen in France or Jörg Haider in Austria, figures he considered genuinely &ldquo;right wing.&rdquo; After the establishment of the LPF and its meteoric rise in popularity, the media and politicians-Dutch and foreign alike-went further, and started calling him the new Hitler or Mussolini.</p>
<p>Fortuyn started getting death threats, and at the time of the publication of his 2002 book, he was hit with a pie filled with feces and urine. He requested security guards, but the Dutch authorities refused to protect him. In 2005, it was revealed that instead of protecting him, the Dutch secret services were <a href="http://www.elsevier.nl/Politiek/nieuws/2005/12/LPF-Onderzoek-naar-Fortuyn-misselijkmakend-ELSEVIER060261W/">spying</a> on him. They tapped his phone and even followed him into gay clubs. Leaked documents also showed they were investigating other members of the LPF.</p>
<p>The LPF continued to build a platform, with immigration control as its central plank. Fortuyn also argued that asylum seekers and war refugees should find shelter in their own part of their world rather than in the West. Although it is not well known outside of Holland, the LPF had a comprehensive platform that made many enemies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Political Elite. Fortuyn blamed the &#8220;purple&#8221; government or &#8220;the left-wing church&#8221; for the failing multicultural state, a weak police force, and a mediocre health care system.</li>
<li>Muslims. All Muslim organizations hate him.</li>
<li>The Dutch royal family. Fortuyn <a href="http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4512/Cultuur/archief/article/detail/2588724/1994/03/28/Pim-Wilhelmus-Fortuyn-is-bezorgd-over-het-koningshuis.dhtml">criticized</a> Queen Beatrice for interfering too much in government matters, and complained that Crown Prince William Alexander was old fashioned and too strongly influenced by the military.</li>
<li>The uniformed services. He thought the police were ineffective, and he wanted to cut military spending and radically reorganize the armed forces. He opposed Dutch participation in development of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which he thought was a huge waste of money.</li>
<li>The European Union. The EU was not as powerful as it is today, but Fortuyn already recognized its love of wielding power that was accountable to no one. As he said, &#8220;The elite of the European Union does not like democracy, in fact this meritocratic-bureaucrat clique is not being controlled by anyone, and they intend to keep it that way.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, Fortuyn had many friends who shared his beliefs. One was Theo van Gogh, a film-maker and columnist, and great-grand nephew of the painter. Van Gogh frequently criticized Dutch multicultural society, and was best known for his short film <em>Submission, </em>about the abuse of women in Islamic society. Van Gogh and Fortuyn sometimes appeared on television together; no one knew that both would soon be dead.</p>
<div id="attachment_111162" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TheoVanGogh.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-111162" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TheoVanGogh.jpg" alt="Theo" width="550" height="370" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TheoVanGogh.jpg 550w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TheoVanGogh-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Theo van Gogh</p></div>
<p>The early part of 2002 was a chaotic time for Fortuyn. His party had been founded only in February, but had to prepare for general elections in May. As the LPF polling numbers climbed, the demonization campaign went into high gear, and Dutch Public Television was especially strident in denouncing the party. Just two months before he was assassinated, Fortuyn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyB-w1V6C8I">denounced</a> the hysteria that had been built up against him:</p>
<blockquote><p>If something happens to me, the purple politicians are also responsible. They cannot just tell you they have not wanted an attack. No. They have created the climate, and this has to stop.</p></blockquote>
<p>On May 6, 2002-just 11 days before the election-Fortuyn gave a radio interview in the city of Hilversum, in which he discussed polls that suggested he might be forming the next government. When he left the studio, a man approached him in the parking lot and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Pim_Fortuyn">shot</a> him in the head, chest and neck. Fortuyn died soon after. The murderer, Volkert van der Graaf, explained at trial that the rise of Fortuyn was like the rise of Nazism in the 1930s. He said he had murdered Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as &#8220;scapegoats,&#8221; and for targeting &#8220;the weak members of society.&#8221; Van der Graaf was sentenced to 18 years in prison, but received a conditional release in May of this year, after serving two-third of his sentence.</p>
<p>The Netherlands was shocked by the assassination, which was the first political murder in its democratic history. Riots broke out in The Hague, near the national parliament, but the elections went ahead as planned. The LPF polled as the second largest party, with 17 percent of the vote. Many potential LPF voters had switched to the Christian Democrats (who never participated in the demonization of Fortuyn), because they felt that the party had no value without its leader-and they were proven right. It took just two years of infighting, financial mismanagement, and lackluster leaders to drive the party to just 1 percent support, and it <a href="http://cookies.publiekeomroep.nl/data/sites/novatv.nl/?crrand=326377851">disintegrated</a> soon thereafter.</p>
<p>In November 2004, Fortuyn&rsquo;s ally Theo van Gogh was <a href="http://mens-en-samenleving.infonu.nl/diversen/2451-de-moord-op-theo-van-gogh.html">butchered</a> on the streets of Amsterdam. Mohammed Bouyeri, a Dutch-Moroccan Muslim, shot him eight times and slit his throat. Mr. Bouyeri then drove a dagger into van Gogh&rsquo;s chest with a note that threatened one of his film collaborators with death. Mr. Bouyeri was sentenced to life in prison.</p>
<p>The Dutch politician who now most closely resembles Fortuyn is Geert Wilders, whose Party for Freedom is now the fourth-largest party in parliament. He has famously said that the Koran &ldquo;incites hatred and killing and therefore has no place in our legal order.&rdquo; He believes there should be no more Muslim immigration, and that all Muslims in Holland should be paid to go home. If Muslim immigration continues, he says, &ldquo;We are heading for the end of European and Dutch civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_111161" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GeertWilders-.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-111161" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GeertWilders-.jpg" alt="Geert Wilders" width="550" height="367" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GeertWilders-.jpg 550w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GeertWilders--300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Geert Wilders</p></div>
<p>Although Fortuyn is dead and his party disintegrated, many of his former supporters now vote for <a href="http://pvv.nl/">Mr. Wilders</a>. Fortuyn was the first Dutchman to give voters a real alternative to the traditional parties and to give voice to that large part of the population that realizes immigration threatens our culture. Fortuyn broke the taboo on frank talk about immigration, an achievement he paid for with his life.</p>
<p>Pim Fortuyn also shows the role just one man can play in history. He started a movement single-handedly. The almost immediate self-destruction of that movement after his assassination shows how essential he was. This always seems to be the case with movements that depart from convention. Traditional parties of the center-right or center-left can plod along with virtually anyone in charge, but a party with a fresh perspective needs extraordinary and charismatic leaders.</p>
<p>Racially aware critics complain that Fortuyn never opposed immigration on the basis of race. Conservatives complain that he opposed immigration for the wrong reasons, namely, that Third-Worlders do not adapt to the features of Western societies that conservatives most dislike: feminism, homosexual marriage, and other forms of egalitarianism.</p>
<p>These critics do not realize that in the late 1990s and even today, it is impossible to win broad support in Holland by criticizing immigration from the Right, and certainly not from a racial perspective. Such views can be too easily caricatured as Nazi or white supremacist, and are confined to the fringe. Pim Fortuyn, with his PhD, his expensive suits, his urbane manner, and his open homosexuality, could attack the horrible consequences of immigration without terrifying Dutch voters. The enormous response he received shows just how much the Dutch resent the transformation of their country, and how willing they are to act on that resentment if they can do so in a way that does not seriously threaten their respectability.</p>
<p>The success of Nigel Farage in Britain and the rise of Marine Le Pen in France-after she purged the National Front of &ldquo;extremists&rdquo;-are further proof of the deep yearning Europeans have for leaders who promise to protect and restore their nations. Someday, open racial appeals will take their legitimate place in the formation of public policy, but that day has not yet come.</p>

All that is necessary is for popular media and pop culture to gin up a campaign of rage and hate against you, and at some point some lone nut will respond to the invective and pop out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>I think eliminationism is the best fit explanation for Arthur Bremer almost assassinating George Wallace, and verily ending his serious national ambitions.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-603048" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Agree with your analysis, but remember the story told by the alleged assassin of MLK, James Earl Ray, who described someone named &#8220;Raul&#8221; who &#8220;managed&#8221; him for more than a year prior to the hit. Raul maneuvered him to Memphis, had him buy a rifle for a hunting trip, put him up in a hotel right across the street from MLK&rsquo;s motel, and the rest is history. Ray never fired a shot that day although he test fired the rifle a couple of days prior to the hit. </p>
<p>Ray managed, prior to his death, to convince the King family of his innocence. That&rsquo;s not to say that he was of course. But his story was compelling.</p>
<p>I am quite familiar with these people like Raul. They are, in the trade, called &#8220;handlers&#8221;. </p>

The Nazis promoted vegetarianism, were extreme environmentalists, believed in socialism (such as high taxes on the rich, efforts to keep wages high, labor unions etc.) but also tough on crime, racist etc. This seemed more like a &#8220;real&#8221; ideology invented by people rather than the fake choices we are given in modern politics. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say if you become a leftist- you support the lowest common denominator, want to discriminate against white males, love immigration etc. the average white person loses.</p>
<p>Right- you want to exploit working people, lower taxes on the rich, exploit the environment (disproportionately harms average people) etc. the average white person loses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s head they win, tales you lose- so pick a side. </p>
<p>Instead more effort should be made creating a realistic and viable alternative to mainstream parties and toss out the &#8220;left&#8221; &#8220;right&#8221; definitions. This is why I dislike it on here when people try to make this a conservative issue or leftist vs right etc. that&rsquo;s the trap they want you to fall into because in the end they define what left and right is- not you, and that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>

Prior to Fortuyn my country was comparable to Sweden today when it came to the subject of immigration. Absolute silence was demanded by the political establishment, and it was zealously enforced. We owe Fortuyn for the country we live in today, where it has become much easier to discuss Islam, immigration and to openly denounce multiculturalism. I will never forget the political turmoil during those days, it was a time of amazing hope and intense frustration. There wasn&rsquo;t a day which went by where tax payer funded newsstations didn&rsquo;t push aggressive propaganda against Fortuyn, or where I didn&rsquo;t overhear another immigrant expressing his deep desire for Pim Fortuyn to be murdered. The entire country held its breath the day he was murdered while waiting for the media to report the ethnicity of his killer, and I have little doubt there would have been a violent reaction if the killer had not been Dutch. I don&rsquo;t think the political establishment would still exist in its current form if the assassin had been an immigrant. </p>

Fortuyn was nearly hailed as a messiah, and the people where galvanised in a way I have not seen since. When he got shot, it was quite clear to me that his followers, talking decent citizens here, were an inch away from taking it to the streets. But..a white leftist shot him. Unfortunately there where no community organisers to channel those feelings into grassroots action. Had I been a grown man back then, I would have made the most of this opportunity. Instead, we mourned. Rotterdam became the scene of one of the largest vigils in its history.</p>

I often feared most for Tommy Robinson the last few years, who was often physically assaulted and received horrifying threats on a daily basis, while not having the same security as Wilders but with a similar high profile in his own country. I don&rsquo;t think Muslims are so strategically incompetent to take out Wilders in the current situation, it would be an incredible mistake. As Fortuyn predicted before his death, the statesman who would take over the reigns after he would be assassinated would be less mild then he was. If Wilders gets assasinated I believe my people will be tolerant of more radical ideas. For Wilders party, his second in command, Martin Bosma is a great intellectual and charismatic enough to keep the party alive if something would happen. He might even have an easier time to become prime minister in that case. </p>

It would _greatly_ detooth The Agenda if the Left were forced to publically recant or suffer their own &#8216;fines&rsquo; for bringing up The Jews and Naziism everytime someone dared to say &#8220;Not in my country.&#8221;<br/>
Keep in mind, the Nazis, if you believe the narrative, wanted everything. Not just a land of their own and the right to say whom they associated with, within it&rsquo;s borders, but a Jew free Greater Reich in which their racial ideals were forced on everyone.<br/>
It is this which differentiates a racist from a genocidist and the rabid Left must be held up as self-righteous, stupid, bigots in their own right for borrowing a slander that doesn&rsquo;t apply, simply because they can think of no other excuse which works when someone says the culture is losing it&rsquo;s quality because of a specific group of unwanted outsiders being forced on everyone.<br/>
As soon as you beat the Reductio Ad Hitlerum strawman misdirect, the Left have no arguments. The statistic destroy their position for them.</p>

Needless to say it was rejected (by a large margin) largely because the media kept raising the spectre of a BNP (or another Nazi-type party) being able to gain traction.

<p>You are right, though, that we have not been a constitutional republic since around 1865. Some say that it began eroding much earlier in 1803 with the Marbury v. Madison, where the Supreme court gave excessive power to itself. But that one is for legal scholars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go with 1865 which ended States&rsquo; rights otherwise known as State sovereignty</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-603996" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>That&rsquo;s because most of the anti-immigration and/or pro-white folks tend to be extremely conservative and find the liberal West to be degenerate. Yes, they tend to use those puritan vague quasi-spiritual terms like &#8220;degeneracy&#8221;, &#8220;decadence&#8221;, or &#8220;moral decay&#8221; (I mind-read those with a Southern accent). Those terms usually involve people not having sex with the right people, not having sex for the right reasons, not being sexually attracted to the people, doing things people of your gender shouldn&rsquo;t be doing (like a girl doing kickboxing), or wearing certain clothes they deem immodest.</p>
<p>This whole puritanical conservatism usually involves people&rsquo;s body parts, gender roles, and fashion choices, with an aura of spirituality/religiosity about it.</p>
<p>Take a look at the comments below the Swedish girls article of yesterday to have a better idea.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons many people (especially homosexuals, social liberals, and other degenates haha) tend avoid these movements and vote for leftist parties even though they may not agree with their immigration policies. The rampant anti-Semitism doesn&rsquo;t help either.</p>

<p>The Western Civilization never stopped to sidestep Christianity ever since it started, bit by bit by bit. And it still is.</p>
<p>Leftists don&rsquo;t view morality as insignificant. They measure morality by human suffering, not by what people do in their bedrooms or with their private parts.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-604080" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The interpretation of the Bible became more liberal, but the influence of Christianity did not become less significant during the Enlightenment. Freedoms were gained during that time because the people believed that fighting against tyranny was fighting for God. The concept of Separation of Church and State was invented and practiced within the framework of a Christian society. All atheist societies so far have been Communists that do the opposite of separate church and state. They combine church and state in to a single entity. </p>
<p>You implied that sexual morality was inconsequential to society at large. This is wrong for many reasons. One problem is people having children that they are incapable of taking of and placing a burden on society. A larger problem is that Whites in most places are having children at rates below the replacement level. Sex shouldn&rsquo;t have to be a political issue, but the left has turned it into an issue by coming up with the idea of same-sex marriage. Society does not benefit by encouraging people to make a lifelong commitment to be in a relationship that does not make sense on a biological level.</p>

<p>Whites tend to not have any more children than they can financially afford. Today&rsquo;s whites are more fiscally responsible.</p>
<p>Also, urbanization tends to lower birthrates. So do higher literacy rates, education, and many other factors.</p>
<p>And this can be observed worldwide. Iran&rsquo;s fertility rate (1.85 children/woman) is lower than that of Norway, Iceland, Sweden, France, the U.K., the U.S., Ireland, and New Zealand.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;One problem is people having children that they are incapable of taking of and placing a burden on society.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>They can have that too even within marriage. Religious people are more inclined to have more children than they can afford. &#8220;Be fruitful and multiply&#8221;. Secular people tend to be more prudent.</p>

I wish that were the case. The reality is that it is a part of a larger agenda. The left is using the issue of same-sex marriage to effectively ban people from openly professing the Christian faith. When people claim to believe in traditional marriage the Left attempts to get them fired from their jobs, or if they are the owner, boycott their companies. Taking away people&rsquo;s livelihoods and their ability to feed their children because of religious disagreements is not an acceptable practice in a free society. The government is also using anti-discrimination laws to force businesses to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies. This means that the power of the state is being used to force people to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.</p>
<p>If same-sex marriage was only about people of the same sex having large gathering where they walk down an isle and exchange rings, then no one would bother opposing it. But the Left is never happy until they can force the rest of society to bend to their will.</p>
<p>I believe very strongly in freedom of association. We have not had true freedom of association since at least the 1964 civil rights act. Since we already can not discriminate based on sex or race, does not being able to discriminate based on sexual orientation make much of a difference? No, not really. But its still a step in the wrong direction.</p>

rights for women and children, abolition of slavery, places of sanctuary for political fugitives &amp; orphans, keepers of libraries and knowledge, founders of the first universities &amp; hospitals, scientific research (i.e. the monk Gregor Mendel and his genetic experiences w/plants), administering food, and care of the sick (i.e. the Black Plague and now, with ebola). Remember, there is an evil agenda to destroy Christianity! Christianity formed the principles that made the West the place where all immigrants want to go! Don&rsquo;t misread me; I am not a mere cheerleader; I have my criticisms too. But ALL we hear in this era is the criticism of Christianity and the West, w/o any fair-minded, educated balance.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-604436" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>First of all, I didn&rsquo;t say Christianity (and religion in general) was all bad.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not criticizing the West. On the contrary. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no &#8220;evil agenda&#8221; against Christianity. It&rsquo;s just that today&rsquo;s secularists are more outspoken. You sound just like the Muslims who say the world is ganging up on them to vilify their religion.</p>
<p>The &#8220;abolition of slavery&#8221; part made smile though. Keep in mind that both the Unionists and Confederates used the Bible to justify keeping/abolishing slavery. And the slavers were on the winning side of the theological debate.</p>
<p>The New Testament makes no condemnation of slave ownership but does have advice for Christian slaves and also regulates how Christian slave owners should treat the slaves they own. (Ephesians 6:5-8; 1 Timothy 6:1-2; Ephesians 6:9; Colossians 4:1; 1 Timothy 1:9-11).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not usually into the militant atheistic business. I rarely criticize religion. But you brought it up.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-604572" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&rsquo;m looking though my Bible here and don&rsquo;t see any condemnation of slavery. Oh wait, I just found a passage from the New Testament about slavery. &#8220;SLAVES, OBEY YOUR MASTERS!&#8221; St. Paul&rsquo;s Letter to the Ephesians (6:5).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, women&rsquo;s right. &#8220;WIVES, OBEY YOUR HUSBANDS!&#8221; Ephesians 5:22</p>
<p>Well, OK, well what about children&rsquo;s right? Turns out that disobedient children should be put to death. Deuteronomy 21:18-21.</p>
<p>&#8220;keepers of libraries and knowledge,&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you familiar with the Church-ordained book burnings? In the 14th Century John Wycliffe was the first person to translate the Bible into English, which did not endear him to the authorities. He preached in England, and on the Continent, that priests should do nothing more than oversee church services and help the laypeople interpret the Bible for themselves. Pope Gregory XI issued no less than five Papal Bulls attempting to shut Wycliffe up, but he would not be silent. 30 years later after his death, the Council of Constance ended &ldquo;the three popes&rsquo; reign&rdquo; and elected Alexander V, who immediately denounced Wycliffe as a heretic, had as many of his books burned as could be found on the Continent and in England, excommunicated and consigned to everlasting flames from the moment of his death. In 1428, Pope Martin V had him dug up and burned at the stake.</p>
<p>&#8220;scientific research&#8221;</p>
<p>That might come to a surprise to Galileo, whose scientific research<br/>
was punished by Church authorities. </p>
<p>See also the case of William Tyndale, who in 1525 translated<br/>
the Bible into vernacular English. It was printed en masse and smuggled all over Europe, especially into England, where the Catholics in charge burned a number of them in public. He was finally caught after some help from a backstabbing friend named Henry Phillips, charged with heresy for no other reason than translating the Bible into English, and strangled, then burned at the stake, on 6 October 1536, in Vilvoorde, outside Brussels. The Catholic Church has never apologized. All subsequent English Bibles, including the King James have borrowed extensively from Tyndale&rsquo;s Bible.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but anyone capable of rubbing two brain cells together can do his own research on the question.</p>

Because if you don&rsquo;t ask&hellip;<br/>
Adolph Hitler suffered literally dozens of well orchestrated attempts on his life during his driving tours of south central Germany (which was then in the process of breaking back up into principalities, with individual militias and police forces) and yet Hitler was always one step ahead of the opposition.<br/>
Some say that this is because his rise to power was orchestrated by outside forces. Others that he simply had a good instinct (and a lot of well armed friends, some of whom later went on to form his Schutz Staffeln) for when it was time to get the hell out of Dodge via an alternate route than that which was planned.<br/>
Mr. Fortuyn was triple tapped with high chest, throat and a head shot from a significant distance &#8216;to make sure&rsquo;, which likely means he was wearing body armor. Yet his killer took the time to walk up and slit his throat, after.<br/>
This was a message: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t talk about uncomfortable subjects or we will deprive your mouth of the air to speak.&#8221;<br/>
And the rabid Left who made it all possible by denying a controversial political figure any personal protection are the sole ones to benefit from the act of raising up a hero only to slaughter him and intimidate all who might have secretly agreed with him.<br/>
This is nothing less than hard psyops in play and it works on the silly assumption that evil never wins and thus if someone is assassinated for saying something which is against the commonly held zeitgeist, &#8216;it must be because they were wrong&rsquo;.<br/>
Evil won a long time ago. The EU as a governing body beyond the power of those it rules proves this.</p>

<p>Pim, Theo, Jorg, to name just a few outspoken people who have come to an untimely end. Jorg Haider of course had a &#8220;crash&#8221; - but I think there was more to it than a mere &#8220;accident&#8221;. </p>
<p>I am not a fan of this liberal-left rhetoric on immigration and protecting the degeneracy of liberal culture from Islam, but beggars cannot be choosers in this game I suppose.</p>
<p>I used to like Geert Wilders until I became a little more wise to the world, but I still have some admiration for a man who stands to his principles and spends about a decade or more living in permanent hiding and &#8216;safe-houses&rsquo;, flanked with bodyguards because he feels so passionately about his cause. </p>
<p>No wonder he is frightened of coming to a sticky end too, given the patterns that seem to be emerging. The real &#8216;tyranny&rsquo; in politics is of course from the immigrants and communistic/liberals, who are prepared to &#8216;take out&rsquo; any threat to them and their ideals. </p>
<p>I think Pim was spot on about how the media and liberals exhibit so much venom and far-fetched scare stories - and how it was them who would contribute to his death one day.</p>
<p>They do have blood on their hands in my opinion, yet in all European nations the media and the liberals are still carrying on with the smears and labels that put peoples lives in danger.</p>

Someday, open racial appeals will take their legitimate place in the formation of public policy, but that day has not yet come.:</p>
<p>This is precisely the point I have been making in several responses on this forum, and people do not seem to understand. Our first and urgent priority is to stop our lifeblood being drained away through mass immigration, legal and illegal. We need an immigration moratorium. And racialist arguments scare away the white masses. We need to eschew those arguments. There are enough cogent reasons that are not racial in nature to stop our being overrun.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how arguments involving &#8221;culture&#8221; will suffice as it&rsquo;s generally believed that individuals can shed conflicting cultural values when they feel accepted.This view is supported by the common belief that the West transformed from a misogynistic, racist, intolerant culture into a multicultural paradise in the short period after Hitler&rsquo;s defeat. At best such arguments will convince them that there will be temporary tensions, a risk most of them are willing to take especially so they can avoid taking a controversial political position. </p>
<p>The many schools of thought within economics also make it difficult to convince opponents, furthermore, as non-white immigrants are economically worse off then Westerners, it is considered immoral by a large part of the public to deny them economic opportunities over gloomy economic forecasts.</p>

Maybe a number that is small enough to count on your fingers. So allow, say, five Etrireans in for every five Dutch citizens that migrate to Etrirea. This solves America&rsquo;s cross-border issues with Mexico vs. Canada. How many Americans want to seek jobs in Canada? Quite a few. How many American would want to seek jobs in Mexico? Not many. Establish balanced, reciprocal Canada America and Canada Mexico permanent immigration quotas, and let the immigration quotas change with emigration volume.</p>

Now white folks were quite eager to do that until WW1, and white boys in their 20s were willing to mate with the local colored gals to produce mixed offspring of various sorts (e.g. the Dutch Burghers in Sri Lanka), but there is no longer a desire for first worlders to immigrate to third world $hitholes, maybe because we do not rule those $hitholes any more.</p>
<p>So for 10,000 H1B visas to be granted annually for immigration from India to the USA, India should be willing to allow 10,000 Americans to settle in India and get US citizenship AND there should be 10,000 American citizens (whatever their color) who actually want to become Indian citizens. So maybe it is not 10,000. Maybe it is 100. So we can allow a 100 green cards and citizenships from India to the USA, in return for 100 Americans of whatever color who become Indian citizens (and the Indian government would have to change its rules to allow that!).</p>

Also when Syria returns to normal, Syrian refugees in Jordan will return while those in Sweden will not.</p>

He also had friends who handled the dirty work and ran interference so that it became increasingly unnecessary for him to smack heads together in his own defense.<br/>
Since simple survival is the only means by which a message as an alternative strategy to the extant Agenda can ever gain a foothold, I would suggest that men like Geert Wilders need both remote video to prove self defense (and scan hostile crowds for observers as opposed to simple nay sayers) and the men on staff to be bullies in shoving the masses back if need be.<br/>
Unfortunately, in this litiginous society, if you have money to hire professional talent you are already pod-peopled as part of the problem. And if you can only provide room and board to a couple thug pals who are big enough to beat your enemies purple you are vulnerable to charges of political intimidation in your own right.<br/>
All this while the simple right to publically speak without due allowance as permits takes from us the kinds of men who can speak to a crowd _like themselves_ and get them sufficiently riled up on racist/nationalist rhetoric as to make them remember how good it felt to stand together with other Kindred and not be victims for 30 minutes.<br/>
It is those kinds of men who can swing votes based on their speaking abilities and will to invoke shared fears and hatreds that this nation needs right now. Because those who are all about normalcy and calm reactions are the ones set to run us, quite willingly, off our own rails.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-607673" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hitler was a man of all seasons who was not good enough at any particular area he needed to be a genius in to carry the day once he achieved success.<br/>
But unlike Mr. Fortuyn who might have risen to greatness on the basis of his &#8216;untouchable minority&rsquo; status as a gay racist, Hitler -did win- a chance to succeed.<br/>
You can argue that Mr. Fortuyn was assassinated because he might have succeeded (and the dominant majority of the ruling class who prefer a pluralist society do so because they cannot foresee the ugly racial backlash and powergrab reality of what happens when whites are not the dominant leaders of their own countries as social systems) but the truth is that Hitler had his hands in both classes pockets.<br/>
The wealth class wanted to use him to destroy the Communists and the Social Democrats and so informed him of assassination and arrest attempts using informers in the ranks of those groups whom they and they alone had the money to fund through &#8216;corporate security&rsquo; systems.<br/>
It is the ONLY explanation for why Hitler could survive so long simply on the basis of &#8220;No driver, take that turn instead.&#8221; simple route changes.<br/>
Yet Hitler also appealed to the beer drinking, working class, German who wanted -something- like a gemeinschaft to go with the gesselschaft as a social contract guarantor of a way out of the terrible (white slavery) that period 1920s German economic troubles found him in.<br/>
Hitler was the man who spoke to their own fears and nascent sense of power as the working muscle of Germany and his plain speech did so in a committed fashion that did not make it seem he was out to win a &#8216;debate point&rsquo; rather than a nation.<br/>
Such lower class men and women gave him secure residency when he moved from city to city and formed the core of his inner bodyguard at very cheap (feed me, booze me, give me a cool uniform) rates while also forming the cadre element of the brown shirted SA whose home grown brutality brought Hitler power far more than the midnight black SS (it was Bormann who did the deals which brought the shadow economics and kurfutz inclusion through local burgemeister recruitment outside the rallies).<br/>
Acknowledging this need to appeal to the base population, unfortunately, the debonair and sophisticated Mr. Fortuyn did not do.<br/>
And so he was alone in the parking lot, without a host driver to pick him up at the door or a bodyguard to open it and walk him out, after making a predictable point-location radio interview appointment.<br/>
Which is all the assassin needed.<br/>
Such is what being too smart to be dragged down into the trenches of race warfare buys you. Such is what thinking that being homosexual as a shield against the ugly truth of class as much as racial dogmas denies you.<br/>
Because as much as the elite class can keep you exposed to being beaten up and killed by denying you the basic protections of a political advocate, the working class have their own standards. And number one of those is that you don&rsquo;t transgress certain, socially hardwired, lines and then expect your polite speech to carry the day anyway.<br/>
The white working class are being destroyed as much because they form their own, picky, in-group of acceptance rules as because they ask for too much.<br/>
I will not compare Mr. Taylor to Hitler. If you choose to insult our host by doing so, that is your mistake.<br/>
I will say that it is likely the reason Mr. Taylor is still breathing has less to do with his intellectual or rational approach to racism than that he has made accommodations with the people who look down on him to the extent that he runs a website which acts as a both a collection point for &#8216;dangerous identities&rsquo; and a safety valve mechanism for blowing off steam.<br/>
And perhaps as a testing ground on certain politically unsavory ideas that can then be &#8216;repackaged for the majority market&rsquo; using key phrase avoidance tactics as soundbyte logic.<br/>
I do not think Mr. Taylor is an innocent. I don&rsquo;t think you can be in this world.<br/>
But he is no Hitler because the world which made Hitler possible doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.<br/>
And I mean that in a good way, even though I believe that Hitler was right on about 90% of what he saw coming as the end of the white race in a genocidal act so huge, subtle and savagely envious that nothing short of &#8216;Liberal&rsquo; conspiracy could enact it.<br/>
Whether you believe such conspiracy to be murderous or simply suicidal depends on how fine mesh you put on the sieve you filter the instigator vs. enactor element of our wealthiest elites from.<br/>
At some level, it&rsquo;s always the 3% who drive our death spiral because it is always the 3% who recognize and act together against what we represent as their greatest evolutionary competitors. It is a made fate, not a consequential one.</p>

<p>However, the guy taught Marxist sociology for a living. His opposition to the muzzies wasn&rsquo;t because he wanted to keep our homelands for us, and that inviting in swarms of outsiders and 3rd worlders would change the racial makeup of Europe, but because the muzzies weren&rsquo;t assimilating. According to the article, he had no issue with them being there. Just with them not playing well with others.</p>
<p>&#8220;He insisted–sincerely, it appears–that he did not object to Muslims<br/>
because of their race but because they were incapable of appreciating<br/>
modernity, which Fortuyn defined in terms of the achievements of the<br/>
Left. For this reason, he rejected any comparison&hellip; to figures he considered genuinely &ldquo;right wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty clear. It doesn&rsquo;t seem that he abandoned anything. I think the reason he got the traction he did was because he was almost untouchable - he was well educated - holding a doctorate in a suitably squishy subject like sociology. He taught Marxist sociology. He was a fellow leftist. He was gay and a snappy dresser. He was almost untouchable by the left, and they hated him for it. So, they had to resort to comparing him to leaders on the right, throwing poo at him and death threats&hellip; eventually being killed.</p>
<p>My point isn&rsquo;t that Pim abandoned his Marxist ways or not. My point is that it&rsquo;s a sad state of affairs when the only person who can speak the truth these days - and actually get any traction with the general public - ends up being a turncoat leftist. Regular folks can&rsquo;t voice the truth without being excoriated&hellip;</p>

So in France there should be some effort to preserve french people and french communities, in the very least, in the Netherlands to preserve the dutch etc. They seem to do this with pine trees, squirrels etc. They are outraged by the lost of some native ground hog to a ground hog from a different continent (and this includes inter breeding). Even the cross breeding of native trees threatens diversity. Laws are made to keep the racial purity of wine grapes in Europe. But no effort at all to protect the native people. No that would be racist. I can understand tolerance, multiculuralism, globalism etc. to a point. Yet what we seem to have is something very extreme and distorted mixed with hatred for white males and this panders itself as &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; and &#8220;tolerance&#8221;. Like the article pointed out- letting in hoardes of muslims who will behead someone for being a homosexual is not promoting tolerance. Constantly attacking the white race is not a promotion of tolerance or freedom, but rather a promotion of third world living conditions and corruption that we see in most non-white societies.</p>
