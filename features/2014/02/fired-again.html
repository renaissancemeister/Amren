Catholic Church continues to punish Frank Borzellieri.</div> 
</div> 


<p>The Catholic Church continues to mistreat Frank Borzellieri. For the second time in three years, the Church to which he has dedicated his life has fired him from a job for which he was eminently <wbr/>qualified. In 2011, without so much as a hearing, a Catholic school fired him because of his honest writings &mdash; written many years earlier &mdash; about race. His latest employer has now fired him for a second time, having learned that a different Catholic had fired him in the past. Again, with no hearing or discussion.</p>
<p>As Mr. Borzellieri explained to American Renaissance, &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t want to hear my side of the story. They have no interest in truth or righteousness; they care only about political correctness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first time Mr. Borzellieri was fired was in August 2011 by the Archdiocese of New York. In the 1990s, he had written a lively column for a chain of New York City weekly newspapers, frequently touching on race and immigration. He also spoke to several AR conferences. He later collected some of his columns into books sold on <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> and other web sites.</p>
<p>Before it hired Mr. Borzellieri in 2006, the Archdiocese officially reviewed his books. Monsignor Michael Hull, who has the title of Censor Librorum, which means &ldquo;censor of books&rdquo; in Latin, officially determined that Mr. Borzellieri&rsquo;s books did not violate Catholic teaching. Mr. Borzellieri was promoted twice, eventually becoming principal of a Catholic elementary school.</p>
<div id="attachment_107854" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Hull.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-107854 " alt="&quot;Censor Librorum&quot; Monsignor Michael Hull" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Hull.jpg" width="550" height="413"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Monsignor Michael Hull, &#8220;Censor Librorum&#8221;</p></div>
<p>After several years as principal, the <i>New York Daily News</i> ran a scurrilous article about Mr. Borzellieri, and he was fired the next day &mdash; for the very same writings the Church had approved. The archdiocese lied outright, claiming it never knew about the books it had officially sanctioned.</p>
<p>Mr. Borzellieri&rsquo;s original story is told in a <a href="/">video interview</a> with Jared Taylor, an <a href="/ar/pdfs/2011/201111ar.pdf">article</a> in <em>American Renaissance</em>, and an <a href="http://takimag.com/article/cultural_marxism_demands_a_sacrifice_john_derbyshire/print#axzz2sYj4KIaO">article</a> by John Derbyshire.</p>
<p>Last November, DuBois Central Catholic School in DuBois, Pennsylvania, hired Mr. Borzellieri as headmaster. The school desperately needed leadership,<wbr/> and by its own admission, it had hired the &#8220;the right man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Borzellieri did not tell DuBois Central that he had been fired from his previous job. He even went through a legal name change so as to make a fresh start. &#8221;Look,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I was under no obligation to reveal what happened to me in New York. I had done nothing wrong. I was a victim. If I had told them in advance, there is no chance that they would have hired me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On five separate occasions, Mr. Borzellieri told potential employers what had happened in New York. Twice, it was when he was on the verge of being hired by a Catholic school. &ldquo;I laid everything out for them,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I was completely upfront. In one case my invitation was revoked. They were willing to throw away the $700 they had already paid for my flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other incident was equally revealing:</p>
<blockquote><p>I decided to email all of the information to the priest in charge of hiring, and asked him point blank if it was worth my making the six-hour drive to upstate New York for the interview.</p>
<p>He replied very thoughtfully, saying he had read all my links, adding, &#8216;It seems a great injustice was done to you. As a priest it is my job to right a wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But then he went on to say he didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the situation, and wished me good luck. In other words, I may have been wronged but someone else would have to right the wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Borzellieri points out he was not dishonest with the people at DuBois. His resume, two master&rsquo;s degrees, and his references were all legitimate, as was his new legal name. Everything he said about himself was true. The usual background checks by the FBI and the state police naturally turned up nothing. In Mr. Borzellieri&rsquo;s view, he simply withheld information about a political controversy that had no bearing on his qualifications for the job.</p>
<div id="attachment_107856" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LeadershipAward.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-107856" alt="Frank Borzellieri receives the Excellence in Leadership Award for School Administration from St. John's University. " src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LeadershipAward.jpg" width="550" height="384"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Frank Borzellieri receives the Excellence in Leadership Award for School Administration from St. John&rsquo;s University.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing illegal about a legal name change,&rdquo; he points out. &ldquo;I even told them my birth name was &#8216;Borzellieri&rsquo; and that my father had shortened it for business-which he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Borzellieri does not know how the school found out about his past, but he first heard about it from one of his references. She, of course, had known about his name change, and had given a recommendation over the phone to the people who hired him. She called Mr. Borzellieri to tell him that the DuBois superintendent had just called to ask why she had &ldquo;lied&rdquo; during the earlier call.</p>
<p>When the superintendent asked her why she had lied, she explained that she had not lied at all. She had been asked if Mr. Borzellieri was a good man and she told him the truth.</p>
<p>The next day, Mr. Borzellieri was fired without a chance to say anything in his own defense.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&ldquo;The tragedy of it,&#8221; he says, &ldquo;is that they were willing to hurt their own school. I was everything they wanted, and was moving things in a positive direction. Now they are leaderless but oh so politically correct.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DuBois1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107859" alt="DuBois" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DuBois1.jpg" width="550" height="323"/></a></p>
<p>Mr. Borzellieri has an impeccable record as an educator and always got excellent reviews. No one ever complained that he mistreated anyone because of race, even when he was dean of discipline at St. Barnabas High School in the Bronx. He was always popular with students, who were mostly non-white. When Mr. Borzellieri was fired the first time, black and Hispanic students wrote statements of support. Last year, when one of his Hispanic former students was killed in a traffic accident the girl&rsquo;s father asked him to give the eulogy.</p>
<p>After he was fired, Mr. Borzellieri spoke with two employees of DuBois Central Catholic School who told him he was doing a great job as headmaster. One said, &ldquo;We all felt lucky to have you. I simply could not believe the story I heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another employee told him, &ldquo;The students loved you and you were working very hard. The school is set way, way back by losing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Borzellieri is again out of a job. He has student loans, a mortgage, no medical insurance, and no job. Please contribute to him:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hope the students fully understand all the reasons Mr. Borzellieri was fired and that they learn a precious life lesson.<br/>
Also, while I commend Mr. Borellieri for his dedication to his students and an unappreciative church, perhaps he may want to explore other options. I know he shouldn&rsquo;t have to. While I admire his commitment and fighting spirit, he is clearly being targeted.<br/>
One can&rsquo;t keep up the fight if one is starving, homeless, and penniless.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-441057" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Also please keep in mind that many of these abuse incidents consisted of priests going after 12-15 year old boys, one of the classic homosexual initiation models, something homosexuals would likely consider fine if done by a Gerry Studds rather than a priest. I wonder whether it is a kind of breeder reactor of homosexuality, as some portion of the abused try to normalize it by doing it to others, or that it is OK because the abused convinces himself that he is gay. Others, as alleged of Sen. Larry Craig, do unto others as was done unto them, perhaps out of some way of treating the abuse as normal.</p>

<p>There are many wonderful Catholic homeschoolers. For instance, here in Michigan, there is a small, informal network of such families on Twitter, who celebrate their Catholic faith and homeschooling experiences.</p>

<p>That 50/100 employee benchmark is where the <i>Cultural Marxists</i> begin their assault on all things American.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-440415" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There is something in this article that needs to be qualified:</p>
<p>&#8220;After several years as principal, the New York Daily News ran a scurrilous article about Mr. Borzellieri, and he was fired the next day &mdash; for the very same writings the Church had approved.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the diocesan censor grants a &#8220;nihil obstat&#8221; (nothing obstructs), he is acting in a official capacity and he has the authority to do so, but it remains merely his opinion. The &#8220;nihil obstat&#8221; is a negative distinction. It is not a claim that anyone in the Catholic Church agrees with the writings. It simply means that, in the opinion of the Monsignor qua diocesan censor, there is nothing contrary or contradictory to that which the Church believes to be revealed by God. So it is not really an official Church approval. </p>
<p>Here is the dictation of Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich, which received both an &#8220;Imprimatur&#8221; (permission of a bishop to print a book regarding faith) and a &#8220;Nihil Obstat:&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The nobler races were always of a lighter color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Catholic mysticism is NOT silent on the subject of race, but leaders within the Church have certainly been wrapped in political correctness as of late.</p>

<p>So he wrote some articles that &#8216;touched on race&rsquo; twenty years ago - big deal. I bet even then they were not &#8220;frothing at the mouth&#8221; rants and more your considered and honest views aimed to make a point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it? That is all he did to get treated this way not once, but twice, and all the snubs in between - let alone have to go to the extent of changing his name by law just to gain employment and a &#8216;fresh start&rsquo;?</p>

<p>This is depending whether one steers more towards the &#8220;patriotism&#8221; and the &#8220;we won the war&#8221; kind of narrative&hellip;&hellip;.or whether one grasps the &#8220;JQ&#8221;, is sympathetic to a bit of revisionism and thus sees the whole affair as more of a stitch up that should never have happened. </p>
<p>Myself, I have transitioned over the years from the former position to being more balanced and sympathetic about the latter view.</p>
<p>As for the wider population, I doubt anybody under 25 even knows who he is, the later middle age folks will tend to still be of the &#8220;we won the war and beat the naaaarrtzeess&#8221; attitude (or completely not a bit bothered either way), and the older generation will tend to still believe the hype yet perhaps be a bit saddened and dismayed as to what Britain is turning into - if not ethnically, then morally.</p>

Someone much more knowledgeable than I speculated that Petain, de Gaulle, and their respective groups had an understanding that it was in the best interests of France&rsquo;s survival that some French be on the winning side. Each took a side knowing that he could end up hanging from the end of a noose for it, but was willing to do so for the good of their country. If true, I find it touching.</p>

I too share some of that analysis and would like to examine it further to see what could be reaped from it. The Church did invest in ethnicity as part of natural law and as someone pointed out, in the US, that may have only been strategic and temporary until assimilation occurred. Perhaps ethnicity as a good needs more development as a theology. All theology did not end with the scholastics, though lots of junk has happened since. I cannot help with a quick resolution to some of your antipathies. I do detect a wee bit of over-generalization. But do not get me wrong, I do think that there is potentially great merit in looking at how the prelates (primarily) violated the sound theology of their own Church&rsquo;s understanding of natural law. I like case studies in failure, whether that be history, engineering, medicine or personal actions. If anything, I would like to see your critique of the Church&rsquo;s practical handling in some, many or even a preponderance of cases of ethnicity be clarified and then the positive role of ethnicity as God-given expression be solidified into a tested and, if worthily done, communicable form. It needs to convince. Charity will go a long way in helping you accomplish that. (My personal struggling with my bring an SOB makes me keenly aware of the struggle that that can be.)</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-458414" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The Mexicans that hopped the fence 40 years ago are mowing the lawns of Koreans that couldn&rsquo;t speak English, read, write, and escaped death camps yesterday. The LA riots were caused by the Meso American tribals the Catholic Church &#8220;saved&#8221; four Centuries ago.</p>
<p>Contrast this with Protestants in early America and they had no qualms about segregation or extermination. They didn&rsquo;t come to bring people into a mystical tent but to save their own people from the European Elite, but because there was never an explicit ethnic and racial identity in Christianity the tribal sense they brought with them quickly faded. The first Naturalization Act was explicitly white. Fast forward 100 years and the Supreme Court is ruling that &#8220;people&#8221; and &#8220;posterity&#8221; didn&rsquo;t mean any specific people or their actual children and allowed the Chinese to invade. Betrayal is easy when your people&rsquo;s historical/religious identity ends 2000 years ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making an &#8220;over-generalization&#8221; at all, I&rsquo;m making a very pointed criticism based on overwhelming evidence. The Catholic church ended the idea of miscegenation in the 17th Century by allowing Conquistadors to marry tribals, creating Mestizos which fragmented both loyalty and identity to Europe.</p>
<p>You should visit Chechar&rsquo;s site The West&rsquo;s Darkest Hour while it still exists. He does a good job of taking scholastic history and merging it with the real world of a mixed race society of the other Americas that whites live in today. Though, he&rsquo;s a bit extreme.</p>

His story is one of many. It is good to know these battle details. I understand the difficulty that he may have in pivoting, though it might be a blessing to him and others. This take over, that I sensed even as a teen in the seventies but did not know how to describe and which others confidently thought would be impossible came into bit fullness in 2008. Ugly stuff. And, yes, there is a great mess of people in the Catholic Church. And one would not expect AmRen and the CC to have identical goals, but the true Church (the Sacraments and theology) is not the rats that infest the organization. Indeed, I would predict periodic waves of rat infestation. Where do the rats need to go to do the most damage? Now, we need not turn this into a proselytization moment. One last point is that the Church, with notable exceptions I am sure, fundamentally recognized that there were differences in people, that expression of human talents and person hood were good whatever that manifestation if, and it is a big IF, the person is open to a sanctifying grace. Bogus social justice nonsense of the modern era was a crafty, destructive insertion. Since God&rsquo;s created beings are inherently good, they are to live their lives in peace. But there is not injunction here to do commie agitation or border invasion. In fact, since the Kingdom is in another world, economic differences are not just invitations to jealousy and political subversion. I think you are thinking of perhaps another religion possibly if you think so. I hop me Frank hangs in his Church. It needs more of him, not less. Suffering? So what is that for a Catholic? </p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know that all people do all things at all times.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the Straw Man you didn&rsquo;t know? I&rsquo;m asking because now you&rsquo;re posturing as if that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you decided to start playing pop psychology; posing as a psychiatrist is typically what Liberals do. You could stop with the diversions. You probably won&rsquo;t but you could.</p>
<p>Either we can talk about real history or you can continue to go down this road. Every time you do I&rsquo;ll call you on it. I&rsquo;m more interested in real information, not sweeping generalizations that don&rsquo;t give us enough information to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>Should we talk about the Swiss Guard? Maybe we could talk about the tragic history of Estonia? The Greeks and Copts didn&rsquo;t come from nowhere, which was my original point.</p>

<p>If, like many on this site, you want the West, or at least the best parts of the West, to be saved and renewed, your problem is not with me, but with the modern open-borders Popes. I&rsquo;m not singling them out. Just about all Western leaders are enthusiastically demographically erasing their own people and civilization. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wish to try to psychoanalyze you, but you seem to be extremely verbal, but have not really mastered a way to string all those words together to make any kind of sense.</p>

<p>This is yet another reason people CAN&rsquo;T be open about race. They&rsquo;d get fired from their job and lose all their friends. This is the price to pay and I&rsquo;d imagine there&rsquo;s even a subconscious influence in this regard.</p>

As for Christianity, it historically did not address ethnic issues because we never had these mass migrations like we have today. It was always assumed that different tribes resided in different lands. In the 20th century the American Catholic church maintained ethnic parishes. You were assigned your parish based on your ancestry, therefore there is a precedent for the hierarchy to recognize the benefits of ethnic separation. It kept the peace and no one complained. What you can also find in modern times are religious leaders speaking out against genocide and that is exactly what is happening to European peoples today. The different ethnic groups arose by isolation and separation. You can&rsquo;t maintain your ethnic identity in a multicultural Babel. The next time someone gets fired they ought to treat their separatist beliefs as a religious issue, protected by the first amendment. It is a violation of my Christian conscience to remain silent as cultural and ethnic warfare is waged against my people.</p>

That element is the &#8216;filioque&rsquo; -the illegal insertion into the Nicene Creed @ 1100A.D. The Orthodox didn&rsquo;t do that, and their entire religious philosophical paradigm, is (as you folks above observed) completely different. </p>
<p>The filioque is the linchpin that undergirds the Romanist &#8216;universal jurisdiction&rsquo; as well as &#8216;multicultural salvation&rsquo; mantra that undergirds the ENTIRE post-Vatican II edifice. Having worked at a RC Seminary college, now 25 years ago, it was bad- real bad- back then! While there are some good priests, there are fewer good bishops, and almost no good cardinals… and the new Pope? Puh-leez. That&rsquo;s why I became Orthodox. I couldn&rsquo;t handle the schizophrenia that is Rome anymore. Of course, running from a pedophile priest in my early 20&#8242;s, didn&rsquo;t help, either. Mr. B. needs to leave Rome, join Orthodoxy, and convert to the Catholic Faith he says he believes in, and do an Ed Snowden, by moving to Russia. The US is toast, and the RCC in the US is the willing lady on the beast, helping the heresy of multiculturaism. Misericordie, Domine.</p>
