Photos of &ldquo;the changing face of Minneapolis.&rdquo;</div> 
</div> 


<p>Along with the rest of America, Minneapolis has become dramatically less white over the last two decades. The percentage of Hispanics almost quintupled between <a href="http://www.minneapolismn.gov/census/2000/census_1990-race-and-ethnicity-by-neighborhood">1990</a> and <a href="http://censusviewer.com/city/MN/Minneapolis">2010</a> from 2.14 to 10.47 percent. There has also been a massive influx of Somalis, though it is hard to know exactly how many have come. There is no category for them in the census, and estimates of the statewide population range from 35,000 to 100,000. Ahmed Ismail Yusuf, author of <i>Somalis in Minnesota</i>, says the number cannot be lower than 60,000.</p>
<p>The majority of Minnesota&rsquo;s Somalis live in Minneapolis, but again there are no firm numbers. Estimates range from a low of 14,500, or about 3.8 percent of the city&rsquo;s population, to a high of 40,000 or 45,000, which would mean there are almost as many Somalis as Hispanics &mdash; or a even a few more.</p>
<p>What follow are some images of what is so frequently and innocuously called, &ldquo;the changing face of Minneapolis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These pictures were taken mainly in three Minneapolis neighborhoods: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar-Riverside,_Minneapolis">Cedar-Riverside</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seward,_Minneapolis">Seward</a>, and along <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Street_(Minneapolis)">Lake Street</a>, a major road that serves as the border for many different neighborhoods.</p>
<p>One sure sign that whites are being displaced is the number of murals. The more murals, the worse the neighborhood.</p>
<div id="attachment_107447" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Stop-the-Violence-2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-107447" alt="Stop the Violence" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Stop-the-Violence-2.jpg" width="600" height="450"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Please click on photo for expanded version.</p></div>
<p>If murals call for an end to the violence you know the neighborhood is very bad.</p>

<p>Writing &ldquo;2&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;two&rdquo; hardly makes this wall a paean to education.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Hennepin-County-WIC.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107425" alt="Hennepin County WIC" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Hennepin-County-WIC.jpg" width="432" height="576"/></a></p>
<p>This mural evokes some sort of non-white pride &mdash; Hispanic? American Indian? &mdash; next to a sign that tells where to get government food through the W.I.C. (Women, Infants, and Children) handouts program.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ArabSomalimural.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107413" alt="ArabSomalimural" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ArabSomalimural.jpg" width="600" height="384"/></a></p>
<p>Much of the &ldquo;wall art&rdquo; suggests that Somali immigrants come from a brightly colored paradise, whereas most of them come from a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/somalia-is-the-most-failed-state-on-earth-2013-7?op=1">hell</a> of their own making.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Abraham-Mural.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107410" alt="Abraham Mural" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Abraham-Mural.jpg" width="500" height="667"/></a></p>
<p>Another irony is the frequent depiction of sunny climates, whereas Minnesota is freezing cold several months out of the year.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/HispanicMural.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107426" alt="HispanicMural" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/HispanicMural.jpg" width="600" height="450"/></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine anyone taking pride in this mural.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Is-this-Poncho-Villa.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107428" alt="Is this Poncho Villa" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Is-this-Poncho-Villa.jpg" width="600" height="622"/></a></p>
<p>This statue is not identified, but it appears to be of the notorious Mexican bandit Pancho Villa.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/New-Race-Church.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107435" alt="New Race Church" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/New-Race-Church.jpg" width="600" height="341"/></a></p>
<p>Though people rarely talk about it, Hispanic immigration is greatly changing the nature of religion in America. This sign is for the Iglesia Nueva Raza, or &ldquo;New Race Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Taqueria-La-Poblanita.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107450" alt="Taqueria La Poblanita" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Taqueria-La-Poblanita.jpg" width="600" height="450"/></a></p>
<p>Most of the buildings are still American but what is inside has changed. This eatery is close another one that recently hosted a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/233287391.html">fatal shooting</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_107416" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Charms-and-potions.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-107416" alt="Charms and potions" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Charms-and-potions.jpg" width="600" height="800"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Please click on photo for expanded version.</p></div>
<p>There are several small Mexican &ldquo;religious&rdquo; or &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; shops. Along with figurines of Jesus, angels, etc, this one sells potions for everything from expelling demons to maintaining erections. It also sells statues of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jes%C3%BAs_Malverde">Jesus Malverde</a>, the &ldquo;narco saint&rdquo; or &ldquo;generous bandit.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/EBT.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107478" alt="EBT" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/EBT.jpg" width="600" height="450"/></a></p>

<p>Perhaps a Mexican rap group will cover &ldquo;<a href="http://stuffblackpeopledontlike.blogspot.com/2011/08/its-free-swipe-your-ebt.html">It&rsquo;s Free, Just Swipe Your EBT!</a>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somalis are also big users of EBT.</p>

<p>Somali women are always covered from head-to-toe, even when they go <a href="http://modestbythesea.com/">swimming</a>. The YMCA in neighboring St. Paul offers special Somali <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/east/232082231.html">girls-only</a> swim sessions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hajj&rdquo; is the pilgrimage all Muslims must make to Mecca, and advertisements for cheap flights are common in Somali neighborhoods.</p>

<p>There have long been efforts to strengthen Somali family and community, but they were steeped up dramatically after a 16-year-old Somali <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/130444768.html">killed</a> three other Somalis a few years ago.</p>

<p>Some people defend Hispanic immigration because they like Mexican food; not many Americans like East African food.</p>

<p>Although Spanish is foreign, and predominantly spoken by non-whites, it is a European language. Somali is completely alien, and has used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_alphabet">Latin alphabet</a> only since 1972.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that a Somali <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/221883721.html">gang war</a> is brewing.</p>

<p>Somalis are adopting American-style consumerism.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Abdi-Abdulle-for-city-council.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107459" alt="Abdi Abdulle for city council" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Abdi-Abdulle-for-city-council.jpg" width="600" height="450"/></a></p>
<p>Although Abdi Abdulle lost the race for City Councilman in Ward 9, the victor was a Hispanic, <a href="../../../about.html">Alondra Cano</a>, who &#8220;built diverse coalitions to promote immigrant rights,&#8221; and &#8220;launched the city&rsquo;s first Latino Engagement Task Force.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Abdi-Warsame-for-City-Council.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107460" alt="Abdi Warsame for City Council" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Abdi-Warsame-for-City-Council.jpg" width="500" height="667"/></a></p>
<p>In 2011, Mr. Warsame <a href="http://www.votewarsame.com/130/meet_abdi">founded</a> the Citizen&rsquo;s Committee for Fair Redistricting, which successfully changed the <a href="http://blogs.mprnews.org/cities/2012/03/minneapolis-redistricting-maps-are-out/">borders of Ward 9</a> so as to create a safe district for Somalis. He then ran for councilman from that ward.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Money-express-and-best-drycleaning.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107433" alt="Money express and best drycleaning" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Money-express-and-best-drycleaning.jpg" width="500" height="312"/></a></p>
<p>When he sought the DFL (the Minnesotan equivalent of Democrats) nomination, Mr. Warsame <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/204788551.html">highlighted</a> his main opponent&rsquo;s homosexuality. Before the general election, his supporters distributed flyers accusing an opponent of racism. He won by a landslide.</p>
<div id="attachment_107439" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Progressive-Book-Store-socialists.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-107439  " alt="Please click on photo for expanded version." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Progressive-Book-Store-socialists.jpg" width="450" height="600"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Please click on photo for expanded version.</p></div>

<p>Minnesota is very leftwing. There is more than one progressive, volunteer-run, non-profit bookstore in Minneapolis, although all their customers appear to be white.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/No-white-Tees-poster.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107437" alt="No white Tees poster" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/No-white-Tees-poster.jpg" width="468" height="624"/></a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;No White Tees&rdquo; sign is at the front entrance of a somewhat fancy Mexican restaurant/bar/club called &ldquo;El Nuevo Rodeo.&rdquo; The purpose of the sign is to discourage blacks from the decidedly less fancy black bar next door, and the 24-hour Denny&rsquo;s across the street. Tensions between the customers of these three places can run high, and since Minneapolis does not permit smoking in restaurants patrons are forced to see each other outside. On Saturday nights in the summer, as many as four squad cars linger on the corner of 27th and Lake Street to keep the peace. When Betsy Hodges, a white Democrat, won Minneapolis&rsquo;s mayoral election last November, El Nuevo Rodeo hosted her <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/230760571.html">victory party</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.health.state.mn.us/">home page</a> of the Minnesota Department of Health has only a small link on a sidebar for &ldquo;Translated Materials.&rdquo; That link leads to separate sections for 17 different languages, including Karen, Nepali, Oromo, and Tibettan. The page for W.I.C. has &ldquo;Informacion en Español&rdquo; and &ldquo;Information in Somali&rdquo; right at the center.</p>

<p>The diversity at South High School <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/191259371.html">exploded</a> into a riot last February between Somalis and American blacks. The <a href="http://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2013/03/fight-south-high-was-more-food-fight">left said</a> it showed that Somalis need to be made more welcome. NeoCons saw it as an opportunity to show that Islam is a danger to blacks.</p>

<p>This is just blocks from several Somali shops. There are no more Vikings in the area. This is what the end of white America looks like.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-417467" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>None of the posters (and many of them say they are from Minnesota) tie in the liberal THEOLOGY of the pseudo-xtian cults known as Protesantism, with the liberal STATECRAFT of this state. For over seven years, on my blog, &#8216;the white christ&rsquo; (wordpress) I have preached &#8216;you can&rsquo;t fight something with nothing,&rsquo; to NO AVAIL. You can&rsquo;t hold to a mamzerim=Elect of God theology, and not have it destroy your state, your nation, your race. If Minnesotans really, truly wanted to turn from this heretical racial melange-ism, they would join my congregation, frankly. But the heresy lies too deep. They are like Pharaoh, hardened hearts and all.</p>
<p>In addition, most of the areas catalogued here, are contained in a small, tightly-woven area of East Central, and along the river (Mississippi) areas of Mpls. The major ideological nexus of all this &#8216;thurd world&rsquo; (the &#8216;h&rsquo; is silent) is the University of Minnesota campus, which is less than a mile from the Cedar-Riverside area. It is the funding (by taxpayer dollars) of the &#8216;U of M&rsquo; that is, has been, and will continue to radicalize the &#8216;young skulls full of mush&rsquo; in this area. Stop that bastard institution, and in twenty years, people might think for themselves again… though I doubt it. it&rsquo;s one of the reasons the wife and I are moving. You cannot help those who deny their sickness.</p>

Nobody knows what percentage of what race makes up American citizens because the census counts everyone living in America at the time of the census, whether they are a citizen or not.. It counts illegal aliens of whom there are millions, it counts the millions of foreign nationals who are here on work visas or student visas. It, however does NOT count the couple of million Americans living abroad. The census makes no difference between citizen and non-citizen. Only American citizens are Americans, the millions of others living here are not. The census needs to differentiate between citizens and non-citizens and then we would get a much more accurate number of the racial percentages of American citizens who as I have said are the only Americans</p>

Just yesterday I was sharing the story of a white Minnesotan guy that I know who said that he would feel just as unsafe living in a poor white community as a poor black community. I remarked on here that Minnesota whites seem to be particularly brainwashed by multiculturalism. Ms. Anthro suggested that since many Minnesotans are of Nordic descent, their apparent cultural suicidal tendencies could be spurred by the same pathological altruism that seems to affecting their Nordic relatives still in their Scandinavian homelands. I tend to agree.</p>

Look at the massive profusion of foreign owned companies today. A report linked on drudge I believe announced Chinese purchase of a former GM plant in Ohio. Drive through any newer business park and half the company names are foreign. Much of the money to purchase these assets was stolen from our grandchildren and gifted to foreign nations while the rest was simply given away via insanely unfair trade treaties. Combine that massive sellout of our industrial base to foreigners loyal to foreign nations with the unbridled importation of third world barbarians less than one generation removed from the Stone Age and the ONLY conclusion one can draw is that this is intentional. Further, it&rsquo;s not just a few senators and congressmen, not just one president of one party or the other, but virtually ALL of them colluding in the very deliberate destruction of America. Meanwhile, we send our bravest young men off to kill people in distant deserts ensuring (1) that they will return in a box or damaged to the point they&rsquo;re no threat to their government&rsquo;s treason and (2) most of the third world stone agers we import will hate us and be intent on our destruction (not merely content with the free ride we give them).</p>
<p>The scope of this deliberate destruction of America is unprecedented and staggers the mind to consider.</p>

<p>We are many, they are few. We are armed to the teeth, they rely on armed mercenaries to protect them. We have skills, they have smarm and connections. We physically control our resources, they rely on us to harvest and distribute them. Our foundations are tradition, culture, faith, kith, and kin. Their foundations are greed, corruption, hypocrisy, perversion, bloodlust, and deceit. We see, acknowledge, appreciate, and work with objective reality no matter how distasteful it is. They refuse to see anything that defies their insane, self-destructive narrative.</p>

Eastwood went out of his way to criticize weak whites who surrender their heritage. It is clear that both of his adult sons are wimps; controlled by anti-white feminist harridans and as a result his white grandchildren became worthless and materialistic. The priest in the film represents the failure of faith and the failure of white churches to tend to their flock. Then Clint berates a simpering wanna-be white who tries to be &#8220;down&#8221; with the bantus.<br/>
I don&rsquo;t think the film was about glorifying new immigrants so much as it was about criticizing the decadent, amoral state of white America.</p>

Hitler? No, he was head of a National Socialist party, completely different from a Communist &#8220;workers&#8221; party.

<p>No, it&rsquo;s not the same as Communism, it wasn&rsquo;t meant to be, but it was designed to gain the support of people who would be tempted by Leftist politics, communist politics.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because the juice-led cultural Marxist regime places (de facto) special legal disabilities on whites. Whites stand up to black invasion (even nonviolently) and they become a worldwide media story and are likely to face 10 years in fed prison on civil rights charges. Mexicans were carrying out ethnic cleansing against blacks for many years in So Cal before the feds were finally compelled to take notice because of shooting deaths. Every time a low income neighborhood changes from black to Mexican common sense dictates that coercion by Mexican gangs played a role in the transformation. It&rsquo;s not like the Mexicans can price the blacks out of the market like SWPL&rsquo;s do. Only in the Hawaiian Gardens case have there been proseutions related to such activities.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-417396" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Massive third world immigration is a far bigger problem than the black population because it (a) puts downward pressure on wages and living standards nationwide and (b) threatens whites with cultural and demographic genocide. Blacks can be isolated and contained (i.e. Jim Crow). Their numbers aren&rsquo;t being artificially increased by massive third world immigration and their percentage of the national population has remained constant since 1900. Because third world immigration is massive and continuous, it leads to a rapidly growing population of hostile racially inferior peoples in the US who will one day pose a major threat to the survival of white Americans when white Americans are finally reduced to a tiny minority in their own country. A first world western culture will not survive the ongoing, large-scale colonization of the US by mestizos and other racial foreigners.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-417459" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I see this happening everywhere in western society, including here in Australia. At night,<br/>
gangs of Somali youths roam the streets of Perth, Western Australia assaulting any white person they come across. The same thing happens in Sydney, Melbourne and<br/>
Adelaide. You will not see it on the NEWS but you do get to hear about it. But what are we to do? Our politicians do not care! Our church leaders do not care! Most white people do not care! They all tell us that &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; and &ldquo;multiculturism&rdquo; is a good thing. Don&rsquo;t resist it, just accept it – you cannot do anything about it, so just let it happen. If you raise an objection you are called a &ldquo;hater&rdquo; or a &ldquo;racist.&rdquo; Those who label you so, will tell you that they know a very good, law-abiding and hard-working Somali by the name of &ldquo;Sambo.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t cause any problems, and anyway whites break the law too. They do not see that an Australia or an America that becomes more and more like the third-world with each passing decade cannot be a good thing for our children or grandchildren. If I wanted my children or grand-children to live in a society ruled by lawless, AIDS infected blacks I would have bought a house in Monrovia or Abuja. I resent the fact that people from the third-world come here to &ldquo;sponge-off&rdquo; our generosity and in the process turn our countries into the pigsties they abandoned. South Africa the jewel of the African continent is now a darker and more dangerous place for all people, including the blacks. So again what are we to do when those who govern us, those who preach to us and those who claim to be our fellow country-men abandon us for the sub-human refuse of the third-world? We can post comments on AR or any other WEB site, but what can we do to make a real difference?</p>

<p>Years ago, I knew a friend that came from Europe, was German/Hungarian. He and his family had to learn English, learn the Constitution, had to have a sponsor before becoming a citizen. They were not allowed to go on the dole. They were responsible people, didn&rsquo;t breed just to get some freebies. All of them were responsible, spoke English while in public, but when at home they talked German, and English. They had respect for our people, our country.</p>

<p>Whites on the other hand are vexed, frustrated, tentative, and afraid to confront any group for fear of being called a bigot. This situation has lead to an interesting phenomenon whereby Whites, feeling a sense of pent up rage, vent and act out on their only available victim - another White. </p>
<p>I hope this is just my imagination- and that other groups rail on each other as well - but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

In our society, everyone is against whites, and whites are against themselves, as a group. White liberals and conservatives scapegoat each other for the problems of nonwhites.

However, I also believe that non-white 3rd world immigration is also a serious problem as that population is growing even more explosively than that of blacks.</p>
<p>I have not even bothered to try to find out about the rate of crime &amp; unemployment in Minneapolis as I believe that once our country loses it&rsquo;s European traditions it will increasingly resemble an African village. The level of civilization will decline although the regional warlord in control of the Village of Minneapolis may keep crime in check by cutting off the heads of his enemies and impaling them on the gate outside his condo.</p>
<p>While I disagree with some of Engleman&rsquo;s apparent positions, I agree with some of what he writes. Also he does contribute to the AmRen discussion and his points are usually well thought out. I think attempting to vilify him is a mirror image of the abuses of &#8220;The Left&#8221; which permits no discussion but merely uses the specter of &#8220;racism&#8221; to silence every arguement.</p>

<p>The sublimation of white ethnocentric tendencies is the result of decades of government-sponsored indoctrination in multicultural ideology. This campaign of multicultural brainwashing has been so successful that now, only a catastrophe can alert whites to their eventual cultural and ethnic destruction in Europe and America. There is a tendency toward self-implosion that is already built into the system. The current globalized economy is predicated on an inner logic, that of infinite exponential growth. This is inherently unsustainable and will lead to the inevitable collapse of neoliberal capitalism. Endless, massive third world immigration will exacerbate racial tensions and lead to violent racial antagonisms; it will also put significant downward pressure on wages and living standards, eventually impoverishing the vast majority of &#8220;Americans,&#8221; including many whites. </p>
<p>Only when whites have nowhere to run, because all of their neighborhoods and communities have been flooded with non-white immigrants, and their livelihoods have been completely destroyed by the transnational corporations, will there be mass resistance against the globalized new world order. This will set the stage for a violent seizure of power and necessitate the formation of a nationalist revolutionary army. The only way to save the white race from total annihilation is to fight a race war and a civil war: a race war to drive out the third world immigrants and their descendants, who will be repatriated to their countries of origin, and a civil war to drive out the Zionist and globalist traitors in<br/>
government. The coming war of European liberation will be like the Yugoslav<br/>
wars of the early 1990s, but many times more destructive and bloody.</p>

<p>All have freedom of contract, unless restricted by other<br/>
clauses, regardless of race, gender, creed, etc. To Wit, as the 14th amendment<br/>
avers, we are equal under law. Equal<br/>
outcome, however, is up to the individual.<br/>
There would be no favoritism due to race nor ethnicity nor other<br/>
factors.</p>
<p>Abortion restriction rights are returned to the states.</p>
<p>Government employees, whether federal, state, or local,<br/>
would not have the right to vote in the jurisdiction of their employment, being<br/>
public servants, where they derive income being 100% or more of what is<br/>
considered &ldquo;poverty level&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Any individual receiving, in essence/ de facto gratis,<br/>
&ldquo;welfare&rdquo; from &ldquo;the government&rdquo;, if as a whole equals or exceeds 50% of the<br/>
&ldquo;poverty level&rdquo; / lowest amount in order to survive, would be restricted from<br/>
voting.</p>
<p>Illegal aliens cannot vote, and the children of illegal<br/>
aliens are NOT automatically US citizens, but each must apply for citizenship<br/>
in the normal process, as limited by the Congress. Other rights as guest workers would be<br/>
specified. This would be retroactive to<br/>
1970.</p>
<p>Private sector employers (whether individuals, partnerships,<br/>
or corporate) would have the right to<br/>
hire and fire, with no forced quotas or affirmative action.</p>
<p>Government employment would be by MERIT, with no favoritism<br/>
for color, ethnicity, or other such factors.</p>
<p>The broad NSA-type broad surveillance would be returned to<br/>
the historically-restricted levels as has historically been determined by<br/>
jurisprudence. </p>
<p>Religious freedoms would exist as per the 1st<br/>
Amendment of the Constitution, with the exception that complete monitoring /<br/>
surveillance of any level considered by the Congress to be prudent, of mosques<br/>
and other Islamic organizations and extensions.</p>

<p>Nope! Just when you think you found that little unique thing, surprise! India has AA for 85% population against 15%, but in reality against 5-10%. What&rsquo;s more, radical church groups in the US support the bottom 20% against the top 10% in India through financial and other kinds of support because they were/are successful in converting the bottom feeders to Christianity through bribes (yes!). American Whites are not only destroying themselves, some of them are busy destroying others as well. Ironically in all this commotion, India&rsquo;s top 5-10% run to the west.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
Still waiting for anyone to explain how it is that those who work at NSA or any other such government agency are traitors&hellip;<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Because the excuse of programs like Carnivore and Echelon is to make the world safer for globalization.<br/>
Not for Americans.<br/>
Nor for Whites.<br/>
Invade to Invite is about breaking Sovereignty of subspecies over their homerange territories, it has nothing to do with a War On Terror and everything to do with global control.<br/>
_If_ the NSA stops terrorist acts (so far only claimed and not authenticated) in the U.S., it is solely as a function of &#8216;proving&rsquo; that terrorism is not a problem for us, and thus allowing umpteen bazillion non-whites to flood our lands, destroy our genetics and rob us of our civilization.<br/>
One which they cannot contribute to because they -did not- create the same in their own homelands.<br/>
If they /don&rsquo;t/, in fact, provide active targeting for anti-terrorism, then their (discovered) use, illegally tapping American communications becomes the real objective and people like you and I are the ones that will find ourselves locked up, prison camped and &#8216;evacuated&rsquo; if we are not killed on arrest.<br/>
The reality is that the white elites get richer providing more of everything to everyone rather than securing what their racial bond group already has.<br/>
And yet they themselves are so isolated from life amongst the black/Hispanic/Asian poor that they have no clue what it is like for the rest of their geneline who suffer enormously for their arrogance and thus they -honestly- seem to believe that there is no race but the human race.<br/>
Even when everything from genetics studies to crimes rates prove otherwise.<br/>
Some are Homo Evolutis. Some are Homo Regressis. And those who are on the verge of becoming the former have no idea what the mindset and manipulative nature of the latter are really like as they seek to attach themselves to success, even if it means pulling it down to entropy and destruction with their own vile habits.<br/>
We are dividing along species lines of those who are capable of continuing the journey of evolution and those who have missed the bus quite a few stops back and are running to catch the society they are no longer able to participate in.<br/>
Among the latter are all of Africa and the majority of Latin America and India.<br/>
What people don&rsquo;t understand is that civilization is a /vehicle/ for that evolution and trying to bring the primitives with us is a guaranteed way to crash the bus.<br/>
NSA, populated as it is by the hyper intelligent looking at the private thoughts of everyone and anyone associated with terrorism, must certainly see this.<br/>
And yet they do not speak out. Nor do they refuse to monitor Americans who would change the status quo.<br/>
Thus they are traitors to their race and to the country whose borders protect them as well as us, ONLY so long as we remain a white nation.</p>

<p>IN ORDER TO FASHION A MORE PERFECT UNION, I WOULD HOPE THAT<br/>
THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION IS AUGMENTED / CLARIFIED WITH THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>All have freedom of contract, unless restricted by other<br/>
clauses, regardless of race, gender, creed, etc. To Wit, as the 14th amendment<br/>
avers, we are equal under law. Equal<br/>
outcome, however, is up to the individual.<br/>
There would be no favoritism due to race nor ethnicity nor other<br/>
factors.</p>
<p>Abortion restriction rights are returned to the states.</p>
<p>Government employees, whether federal, state, or local,<br/>
would not have the right to vote in the jurisdiction of their employment, being<br/>
public servants, where they derive income being 100% or more of what is<br/>
considered &ldquo;poverty level&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Any individual receiving, in essence/ de facto gratis,<br/>
&ldquo;welfare&rdquo; from &ldquo;the government&rdquo;, if as a whole equals or exceeds 50% of the<br/>
&ldquo;poverty level&rdquo; / lowest amount in order to survive, would be restricted from<br/>
voting.</p>
<p>Illegal aliens cannot vote, and the children of illegal<br/>
aliens are NOT automatically US citizens, but each must apply for citizenship<br/>
in the normal process, as limited by the Congress. Other rights as guest workers would be<br/>
specified. This would be retroactive to<br/>
1970.</p>
<p>Private sector employers (whether individuals, partnerships,<br/>
or corporate) would have the right to<br/>
hire and fire, with no forced quotas or affirmative action.</p>
<p>Government employment would be by MERIT, with no favoritism<br/>
for color, ethnicity, or other such factors.</p>
<p>The broad NSA-type broad surveillance would be returned to<br/>
the historically-restricted levels as has historically been determined by<br/>
jurisprudence. </p>
<p>Religious freedoms would exist as per the 1st<br/>
Amendment of the Constitution, with the exception that complete monitoring /<br/>
surveillance of any level considered by the Congress to be prudent, of mosques<br/>
and other Islamic organizations and extensions.</p>

<p>Hey Paul, Amren is not another Neo Conservative waste of space. Ted Cruz, Mark Levin, Rand Paul do not speak for us. Please read Amren&rsquo;s year end article on Rand Paul - 2013 White traitor of the year.this terrible traitor Rand Paul is now running for President (same as his loon father since 1988) based on outreach toBlacks in Deteoit. This traitor was given full access to the MSM response to Obama&rsquo;s state of the union address. Rand Paul announced that we must allow every single human on planet earth who wants to move to theU itedStates and work,we must welcome all of them! This traitor, loonRandPaul takes the side of nasty Afro Arab Al Qaeda terrorist leader in Yemen - because this monster was somehow an American citizen based on birthright citizenship! This loon Rand Paul is spreading ridiculous CT paranoia that theUS military is preparing to slaughter Americans with drone attacks!</p>

After verbal warnings, I swatted her with a rolled up newspaper on her butt. That drove the point home. i will never forget the expression on her face: a mixture of surprise, recognition, and fear. From that point on, she and I were very close and mutually loving. I still tear up when I think too much of her, such a personality and intelligence. </p>

Regardless: what the country ( the actual Americans for justice) needs is * * galvanization of realization of the reality, the fix we are in * a willingness to do what needs to be done ( such as a constitutional clarification convention { see my letter below as an example} with representation as per that, er, document) * and a simple implementation of justice, not allowing whites to be the &#8220;beating horse&#8221; we have been due to the whoring left for the past 50 years.</p>

<p>I support Israel, the homeland of the Jews&hellip;</p>
<p>So go home!</p>
<p>Get out of our home.</p>
<p>Just understand Jews in Israeli don&rsquo;t tolerate race denying, Lib Libertarian trolls, cultural Marxists, Austrian style free market economists etc.</p>
<p>If you move to Israel you&rsquo;ll be expected to get a real job and do military service. Frankly, you seriously need to do some basic training, get up before dawn and do push-ups, get off the Internet and make something of your life.</p>
<p>Do we have any solid Jewish Israeli readers who have any experience reforming these types?</p>

One would think the Horn of Africa would be, relatively speaking, far better off than purely black West Africa. I understand Islam breeds fanaticism and violence, but as a simple, easy to understand religion with strict rules about fidelity, charity, law-abidingness (no murder, rape, theft, etc) one might think it would be better for black Africans than their native paganism, or perhaps even Christianity at least in secular terms. So what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
