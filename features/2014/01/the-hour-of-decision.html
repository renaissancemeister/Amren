	                	<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Oswald Spengler, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Hour-Decision-World-Historical-Evolution/dp/1410202666"><i>The Hour of Decision: Germany and World-Historical Evolution</i></a>, University Press of the Pacific; 230 pp., $24.75.</strong></p>
<p>If <i>The Decline of the West</i> is one of those great books everyone knows about but few have read, <i>The Hour of Decision</i> is a great book that few even know about. That is a shame, because this is a prophetic book that has much to teach us.</p>
<p>Written in 1933, 15 years after Spengler&rsquo;s masterpiece of cultural and historical reasoning, <i>The Hour of Decision </i>is a warning to the white race of two perils, one from below and one from without: class war and race war. By the first, he meant a working class uprising led by professional revolutionaries; by the second, colonial rebellion against white rule. The first threat has passed, but the second has been realized: White minority rule has been overthrown everywhere; South Africa was the last holdout.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/OswaldSpengler.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107670" alt="OswaldSpengler" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/OswaldSpengler.jpg" width="364" height="550"/></a></p>
<p>A new danger has arisen, one that Spengler did not foresee: the mass migration of non-whites into the West. While Spengler did not anticipate this &mdash; how could he? &mdash; he saw the cultural, intellectual, and political pathologies that prepared the way for it, and his dissection of these forces is of great value.</p>
<p>Curiously, Spengler claimed to have a non-biological view of race, calling racial purity a &ldquo;grotesque word&rdquo; in view of what he calls centuries of race mixing. &ldquo;What is needed is not a pure race,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but a strong one.&rdquo; This assertion is confined to one short paragraph, is hardly an argument, and is essentially contradicted by the whole tenor of the rest of his book.</p>
<p>I believe that this scientifically unsound and evidentially weak statement has been misunderstood. Spengler would never have countenanced miscegenation or mass immigration and may well have been using the word &ldquo;race&rdquo; in the sense of the &ldquo;the British race&rdquo; or &ldquo;German race,&rdquo; as was common in his time.</p>
<div id="attachment_107672" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/EuropeanRaces.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-107672" alt="One kind of &quot;racial&quot; diversity." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/EuropeanRaces.jpg" width="550" height="240"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One kind of &#8220;racial&#8221; diversity.</p></div>
<p>Spengler&rsquo;s views make sense in the light of his pan-European ideals. He believed it was imperative that Europeans stop fighting each other and unite in a continental confederation for defense of both the European homeland and overseas possessions. Because Europeans were, even then, a small minority of the world&rsquo;s population, it was essential that they remain united. Thus, Spengler&rsquo;s dismissal of racial purity was probably an attempt to blunt excessive expressions of Germanic and Scandinavian racial superiority. The comradeship of Slavs or Iberians should not be rejected, since they are fellow whites. That said, Spengler did believe in Nordic superiority. He wrote that &ldquo;the Celtic-Germanic &lsquo;race&rsquo; is the strongest willed that the world has ever seen,&rdquo; and he stressed the importance of cultivating &ldquo;the relic of healthy race-instinct, the trace of Nordic heroism left in these nations.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Hatred of the white race&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>For Spengler there were no victors in the world war of 1914 to 1918. All white nations had lost because they had squandered their best men and valuable capital for no good purpose. He called the result &ldquo;a defeat of the white races;&rdquo; the division and carnage emboldened the colored peoples to think they could free themselves from European rule. However, Spengler warned that the colonial peoples were motivated by more than the desire for self-determination. They were driven by &ldquo;hatred of the white race and an unconditional urge to destroy it.&rdquo; He believed this hatred was driven by envy. &ldquo;Envy is the crooked glance from below at something higher, which remains uncomprehended and unattainable, and must therefore be pulled off its perch, sullied, and destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_107673" style="width: 489px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/HatianRevolution.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-107673" alt="HatianRevolution" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/HatianRevolution.jpg" width="479" height="550"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Massacre of whites during the revolution in Haiti.</p></div>
<p>Such envy could be class based: the hatred of the upper bourgeoisie for the landed aristocracy and of the proletariat for the middle class. It could also be race based: the envy of non-whites for whites, because non-whites can achieve neither the aesthetic perfection of whites nor their refined way of life. Neither education nor money changes racial characteristics. The closest a person of color can come to &ldquo;becoming white&rdquo; is to marry a white woman or a white man, and have lighter-skinned children.</p>
<p>Spengler&rsquo;s view is fully confirmed by ever-increasing anti-white rhetoric and politics. Forty years of welfare, affirmative action, racial quotas, and liberal immigration have not appeased but increased the antipathy of the beneficiaries toward the white majority. Clearly, the brown and black races will be satisfied with nothing less than the expropriation of all white lands. Spengler&rsquo;s opening passage therefore has even greater resonance now than when he wrote it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there today a man among the White races who has eyes to see what is going on around him on the face of the globe? To see the immensity of the danger which looms over this mass of peoples?</p></blockquote>
<p>Another danger was the prospect of &ldquo;a second world war&rdquo; coming after the &ldquo;first world war&rdquo; of 1914-1918. These were Spengler&rsquo;s exact words, remarkably prescient for 1933. He did not name the belligerents, but it is clear he thought National Socialist Germany and Communist Russia would be on opposite sides. The Russians might be white, but their embrace of internationalist socialism meant that they had become culturally and politically part of Asia. Even so, Spengler warned Germans of the folly of invasion:</p>
<blockquote><p>The population of the mightiest of the earth&rsquo;s inland areas is unassailable from outside. Distance is a force, politically and militarily, which has not yet been conquered. Napoleon came to know this. What good does it do an enemy to occupy areas no matter how immense? To make even the attempt impossible the Bolsheviks have transferred the centre of gravity of their system farther and farther eastward. The great industrial areas which are important to power politics have one and all been built up east of Moscow, for the greater part east of the Urals. The whole area west of Moscow &mdash; White Russia, the Ukraine, once from Riga to Odessa the most vital portion of the Tsar&rsquo;s empire &mdash; forms today a fantastic glacis against &lsquo;Europe.&rsquo; It could be sacrificed without a crash of the whole system. But by the same token any idea of an offensive from the West has become senseless. It would be thrust into empty space.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Propaganda.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107674" alt="Propaganda" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Propaganda.jpg" width="550" height="354"/></a></p>
<p>Spengler believed Peter the Great had westernized Russia and brought it into the white world, making it white by both race and culture. The Bolsheviks had reversed that achievement and Orientalized Russia. One could argue that President Putin, an Eastern Orthodox Christian and a white patriot, has brought Russia back into the European world, while the United States, now officially multi-racial, has ceased to be part of the West. This is how Spengler saw the United States in 1933, despite the immigration restrictions of 1924:</p>
<blockquote><p>All we know is that so far there is neither a real nation nor a real state . . . [but only] a boundless field and a population of trappers, drifting from town to town in the dollar hunt, unscrupulous and dissolute; for the law is only for those who are not cunning or powerful enough to ignore it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spengler saw America&rsquo;s recent immigrants as &ldquo;an alien, foreign-thinking, and very prolific proletariat.&rdquo; America&rsquo;s war-time unity and victory over Japan proved that the country was not as far gone as Spengler believed. However, his characterization applies all too well to post-Cold War America. Second- and third-generation immigrants have shown resentment rather than gratitude toward their adopted country.</p>
<p>Spengler&rsquo;s critique of America as rootless, uncultured, and devoted to pleasure and money making was part of his critique of liberal economics as one of the prime causes of Western decline. In his view, economics should always be subordinated to politics, by which he meant, made to serve the welfare of the people, not the profits of the plutocracy. Economics should be about ordering the economic life of the nation so as to augment its inner strength and organic unity. Instead, it had become a &ldquo;method by which with the least exertion the most money and pleasure can be secured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By so doing, economics had fostered class divisions and driven the working class into the arms of ruthless revolutionaries. Spengler wrote that &ldquo;the manual worker is merely a means to the private ends of professional revolutionaries. He is to fight for the satisfaction of their hatred for the conservative forces.&rdquo; He added that &ldquo;their &lsquo;dictatorship of the proletariat&rsquo; &rdquo; was merely &ldquo;their own dictatorship with the help of the proletariat.&rdquo; Similarly, he denounced political liberalism as &ldquo;the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lenin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107675" alt="Lenin" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lenin.jpg" width="418" height="550"/></a></p>
<p>Spengler believed parliamentary politics across the Western world had become dominated by selfish interests competing for the favors of a bureaucratic state, with capitalist and socialist parties as two sides of the same base coin. His proposed an alternative that he called Prussianism, which stood for &ldquo;the aristocratic ordering of life.&rdquo; There must be hierarchy, but it must not be based on money. &ldquo;The Prussian idea,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;is opposed to finance-Liberalism as well as to Labour-Socialism.&rdquo; It was &ldquo;opposed to any weakening of the State and to the misuse of it for economic interests.&rdquo; It stood for &ldquo;possessions,&rdquo; meaning land, well-built houses, farms, and real businesses. It also stood for &ldquo;inheritance, fecundity, and family, which three belong together; [and] for distinctions of rank and social gradation.&rdquo; Some have seen the British aristocracy in this light. It governed with inherited authority and a sense of national ownership that led to policies in the common interest.</p>
<p>Spengler believed Germany was the youngest and healthiest of the European nations, relatively uncorrupted by money and individual selfishness, and still possessed of the elements of &ldquo;Prussianism.&rdquo; Germany stood guard at the borders of Asia, and was thus &ldquo;the key country&rdquo; of the West, the potential &ldquo;educator of the white world, and perhaps its savior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is therefore a surprise to learn that after the National Socialists came to power they quietly proscribed Spengler and suppressed his books. The German press was directed not to write about Spengler and his books were taken off the shelves. <i>The Decline of the West</i> would not be available in Germany again until 1950. Spengler&rsquo;s projected second volume of <i>The Hour of Decision</i> never appeared, either because he did not finish it or because the Gestapo confiscated the manuscript after he died in 1936. The regime suppressed Spengler because of his alleged rejection of the biological basis for race, his mild opposition to anti-Semitism, and for negative comments he made about Hitler. Spengler was not a Nazi.</p>
<p>An important lesson Spengler has for whites living in an increasingly decadent West is the imperative of having large families. The prevailing custom of having one, two, or no children is as great a danger to the white world as non-white immigration. Small families may, in theory, be good for the environment, but unborn white children are replaced by non-white children of immigrants.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/RomneyFamily.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107678" alt="RomneyFamily" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/RomneyFamily.jpg" width="550" height="340"/></a></p>
<p>As Spengler realized long before the post-1960s decline in birth rates, &ldquo;the decay of the white family, the inevitable outcome of megapolitan existence, is spreading and is devouring the race of nations,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;People live for themselves alone and not for future generations.&rdquo; He believed that a vigorous people does not believe a higher standard of living is more important than having children: &ldquo;A woman of race does not desire to be a companion or a lover, but a mother.&rdquo; A man of race &ldquo;wants stout sons who will perpetuate his name and his deeds beyond his death . . . and enhance them. That is the Nordic ideal of immortality.&rdquo; The West&rsquo;s colonization of large parts of the non-European world was possible only because of large families, and this is how we must defend our lands and ensure our survival.</p>

<p>2.  Mr. Sims tells us in his writing that there is a necessary trade-off between high white TFR and our racially replacing ourselves.  Then right below that, either he or the AR editorial staff include a two-ago picture of the high TFR Romney family Christmas photo.  The irony of that is that in the year between that photo and the most recent one, there has been a new black adopted addition to that family.  Therefore, the high TFR of the Romneys is hardly an deterrent <i>in se</i> to racial replacement.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-428925" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Portions of this commentary seem relevant to a very memorable portion of the fascinating<br/>
interview of Arthur Jensen by Jared Taylor back in 1992.  The question is whether the<br/>
preservation of the evolved gene frequency grouping known as the White race is more<br/>
important, say, than the preservation of that characterized by the Chinese, in particular, and<br/>
Japan and the Koreas, as well.   The great spectre appears to be that none of the evolved<br/>
gene frequencies capable of cultural carriage, propagation, and enhancement, will be<br/>
sustained.  The nightmare, then, becomes an increasingly gray faceless mass of technologially and media-entranced humanity ruled by pockets of varied amoral despotisms.<br/>
Human overpopulation appears more and more a basic element in a future catastrophe.?</p>

1. moustache<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br/>
5. They didn&rsquo;t listen to their generals.<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br/>
10. They ordered their troops to fight to the last man.<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br/>
15. They had propensity for cheap theatrics.<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br/>
20. They both didn&rsquo;t like Jews and &#8220;degenerate art&#8221;.<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br/>
25. Stalin was called &#8220;vozhd&#8221;. It&rsquo;s Russian for Fuhrer.<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br/>
30. Hitler emphasized &#8220;race origin&#8221; and &#8220;race struggle. Stalin emphasized &#8220;class origin&#8221; and &#8220;class struggle&#8221;</p>
<p>At least Stalin didn&rsquo;t lose his grip on reality. That&rsquo;s why, poisoned or not, he died in his bed as a ruler of a huge  Empire.<br/>
 The &#8220;thousand year Reich&#8221; didn&rsquo;t last long.</p>

Stalin made Hitler look like a boy scout in terms of the number of victims. 7 million in the Ukraine alone at a time when there was no war.</p>

There were plenty of Slavs carrying out Stalin&rsquo;s orders.<br/>
Find balanced books about Russian Revolution, Russian Civil War and Soviet history. Don&rsquo;t believe everything coming from Russian émigrés. They would never admit that regardless of Jewish involvement, they were defeated and kicked out of the country by their own people.<br/>
Don&rsquo;t believe everything coming from Ukrainian nationalists. They would never admit that they were brutalized by tneit fellow Slavs.<br/>

At the end of chapter 15, he writes that Jews must answer for the &#8220;revolutionary cutthroats&#8221; in their ranks just as Russians must repent &#8220;for the pogroms, for&hellip;merciless arsonist peasants, for&hellip;crazed revolutionary soldiers.&#8221; It is not, he adds, a matter of answering &#8220;before other peoples, but to oneself, to one&rsquo;s consciousness, and before God.&#8221;<br/>
I cut and pasted it from Wikipedia to save time but I can vouch for the quotation veracity. I have read Solzhenitsyn books in Russian.</p>

Danzig was declared a free city under the protection of the League of Nations. Poles didn&rsquo;t approve and did everything to strangle Danzig&rsquo;s economic life. Hitler felt he had to intervene to protect Germans in Danzig. Incidentally, Danzig had been a German city since early 1200s forming an important part of Hanseatic League. It was the Versailles Diktat which made Danzig a protectorate of the League of Nations. The Germans were forced to sign the Diktat to end the British blockade which caused the starvation of thousands of German civilians immediately after WWI. </p>

If they&rsquo;d spent a few decades consolidating their domestic or local gains first, they&rsquo;d have had ample time to probe for opportunities for expansion later.  Perhaps they may have eventually decided that expansion wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble.  Instead they chose war and created a bitterness that lasts till the present.  It was truly a catastrophic blunder.</p>
<p>That said, it seems to me you are just as &#8220;obsessed&#8221; as they were.  Let it go, pal.  I know it wasn&rsquo;t pretty for those of us on the receiving end, but good God man, just look at the world around you: if that doesn&rsquo;t prompt you to let bygones be bygones I don&rsquo;t know what in the world could.</p>

Their economic plan was failing and they needed to seize the wealth of other nations. That was their plan all along, but they originally had planned to take another ten years or so to build up Germanys military and economy. The problem was the economy was failing, they were ruining it. Taking the Czech lands provided a short stimulus but they needed more. The war was all about saving the behinds of Hitler and his gang.</p>

Incidentally he isn&rsquo;t the only one who makes the claim that Stalin was ready to invade Europe in the summer of 1941. Werner Maser in his book &#8220;Der Wortbruch Hitler, Stalin und der Zweite Weltkrieg&#8221; comes to the same conclusion. Hitler basically beat Stalin to the punch.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-443359" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;A noteworthy rebuttal of Suvorov&rsquo;s thesis is contained in Colonel David Glantz&rsquo;s work Stumbling Colossus: The Red Army on the Eve of World War. Glantz views Suvorov&rsquo;s argument as &#8220;incredible&#8221; on a variety of fronts: first, Suvorov rejects without examination classified ex-Soviet archival material, and makes highly selective picks from memoirs. Glantz points to this as a serious methodological flaw&#8221;<br/>
Further, Glantz argues, Suvorov&rsquo;s thesis is strongly contradicted both by ex-Soviet and German archival material, and the facts do not support the argument that the Red Army was prepared to invade Germany.[1] On the contrary, the appalling lack of readiness, poor training level, and abysmal state of deployments show that the Red Army was unprepared for static defense, much less large-scale offensive operations. Glantz&rsquo;s conclusion is that &#8220;Stalin may well have been an unscrupulous tyrant, but he was not a lunatic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For his part, however, Suvorov not only admits his selectiveness but justifies his methods, recalling his work in the intelligence community:<br/>
&#8220;If a hundred secret agents are reporting one way, and one sounds out of place and makes no sense, deal with him. No one will trust him or you, they will laugh at you, and they will not believe you. But this is how great discoveries are made&#8221;.[2]</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from Wikipedia. Take it for what it worth.</p>

<p>Zen is a Chinese product which the Japanese took from China, as well as their writing and ever since Zen has permeated the spirit of Japanese culture and art forms and expression.<br/>
All nations and great civilizations have declined and disappeared from history; not the Chinese, which are backed by thousands of years of uninterrupted existence.</p>
<p>The Yang-Tze and Huang-Po rivers are one of the 5 cradles where civilization aroused spontaneously for the first time on earth, along with the Nile, the Tigris &amp; Euphrates, and the wetlands of Meso-America and the Andes.</p>
<p>During the early years of the Ming Dynasty 3 flotillas of hundreds of Chinese vessels circumnavigated the world and mapped it 70 years before Columbus.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t say that! We&rsquo;re the good guys, seriously.</p>
<p>If we weren&rsquo;t good, we wouldn&rsquo;t have considered defending our own people. We&rsquo;re really the best people on earth, because our civilisation is the best thing that ever happened to mankind. An increase in the amount of Nordic people is just what we need.</p>

<p>I like your philosophy. We should have had more Neanderthal philosophers. If we had only such philosophers, we would already be celebrating the day we smashed the invaders. </p>
<p>My &#8220;good&#8221; perhaps means &#8220;evil&#8221; in certain people&rsquo;s vocabularies, but in my vocabulary &#8220;good&#8221; is doing everything that is necessary for survival, i.e. being efficient. </p>
<p>But yea, I&rsquo;m the person that you&rsquo;d encounter in your worst nightmares, if you were a liberal. I&rsquo;d like to see how liberals wake up from such nightmares, it must be really tough to fall asleep with people like me around. Maybe they should cry themselves to sleep every night. Seriously, they are crybabies.</p>

He, too, has been suppressed by both National Review and MSNBC.  In my opinion, he has been making accurate calls for at least the last 25 years.  He warned against taking action against Iraq (I did not agree with him then, but now see the wisdom in it), against nation building, in favor of immigration control, in favor of whites and their interests, against foreign entanglements, in favor of Christian Europe . . . he provides good advice.</p>

Maybe that he liked to criticize Republicans from time to time, MSNBC assumed that all the whack job leftists that watch it would enjoy it.</p>
<p>The excuse they gave in firing him was a dog that didn&rsquo;t hunt, though.  They cited his most recent book and all the &#8220;abhorrent&#8221; statements in it.  Of course, when MSNBC hired him, he already by that point authored a lot of books with the same kind of &#8220;abhorrent&#8221; statements.  So they knew how &#8220;abhorrent&#8221; he was when they hired him.  I just happen to think the suits at MSNBC got too many complaints from their kook left viewers.</p>
<p>You could see the same thing with Disney refusing to use the Hank Williams song for Monday Night Football.  The grounds was that HWJ cut a pro-Dixie song.  Except he cut that song in 1988, three years BEFORE ABC hired him to do the MNF theme.</p>

<p>My position too, but was Buchanan right for the right reason?</p>
<p>Buchanan opposed the Iraq war because, as he saw it, the US national interest was not involved. But the war was a bad idea because</p>
<p>1. There were no WMD<br/>
2. Nation building in Arab states is an impossibility because there is no common national identity to build upon.</p>
<p>2. is the central problem; dictatorship in Arab countries is the inevitable outcome of their irreconcilable internal divisions. European style democracy can only emerge where the losing group in an election is prepared to be governed by a party they do not support, in the expectation that they had a fair shot and will be able to try again in a few years. We can see this now in a way we could not back in 2003 (the examples of Egypt, Libya and Syria have driven the point home). This is why the Iraq invasion and subsequent nation building was a bad policy. But this is not the point of Buchanan&rsquo;s opposition. So he was right, but for the wrong reason.</p>

If we had totally defeated the country, and dealt with any insurgency as ruthlessly as we dealt with the werewolves in post war Germany, then the invasion would have been good for us. We could have used the land to our profit and used the oil wealth to build this nations strength. OF course we would have had to suppress and maybe even replace the local population, but so what. Yes, I know that that would not be politically possible in a country that allows it&rsquo;s press to act against the government. WE are losing because white people have become too nice, too fair, to compassionate, too soft. WE had the ability to seize the middle east and use it&rsquo;s wealth but we did not do it. and one does not get a second chance.</p>

He disagreed with the &#8220;zoological antisemitism&#8221; of Nazis, just as he also opposed the creation of a ring-fence around Germany and a &#8220;Napoleonic adventure&#8221; in Russia; wisely enough, some may think.  There are similarities between his philosophy and national socialism in many respects, but despite efforts of Nietzsche&rsquo;s sister Spengler and Hitler did not have a fruitful meeting.  Spengler regarded Hitler as a political opera-singer, and Hitler rejected &#8220;Untergang&#8221; when reading in prison and condemned Spengler&rsquo;s pessimism in a public speech after coming to power.  What is remarkable in this &#8220;Hour of Decision&#8221; is Spengler&rsquo;s prediction of a race war against the white world, with the western underclass as its alliance, even after the voice of Moscow has ceased to dictate.  It is one of the most important small books of the last century.</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>Historian Margaret MacMillan in a BookTV[.]org presentation last weekend on her new book &#8220;The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914&#8243; made that point.  Summarizing: What the Europeans did to themselves in World War I taught non-whites to question white rule over their lands.</p>
<p>Obviously World War II doubled down on that point, leading to today&rsquo;s absurd worship of diversity in The West.   Peter Brimelow of Vdare[.]com made that point memorably in 2006: </p>
<p>&#8220;There is a sense in which current immigration policy is Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s posthumous revenge on America. The U.S. political elite emerged from the war passionately concerned to cleanse itself from all taints of racism or xenophobia. Eventually, it enacted the epochal Immigration Act (technically, the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments) of 1965. </p>
<p>&#8220;And this, quite accidentally, triggered a renewed mass immigration, so huge and so systematically different from anything that had gone before as to transform &mdash; and ultimately, perhaps, even to destroy &mdash; the one unquestioned victor of World War II: the American nation, as it had evolved by the middle of the 20th century. </p>
<p>&#8220;Today, U.S. government policy is literally dissolving the people and electing a new one. You can be for this or you can be against it. But the fact is undeniable.&#8221; </p>
<p>America&rsquo;s Immigration Policy &mdash; Hitler&rsquo;s Revenge?<br/>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been puzzled by the Slavs&rsquo; sudden appearance on the world stage around the collapse of the Roman empire.  I theorize that they were &#8220;swampbillies&#8221;, had hid out in the Pripyet marshes since time immemorial, emerged in the vacuum left by the Huns.</p>
<p>Regardless, Hitler&rsquo;s selective approval or disapproval of Slavs as OK or not seemed heavily contingent on the real estate they occupied.  If they were squatting on land he wanted they were inferior, if not they were used as puppets.</p>
<p>Anyway, anybody or any ideology that would condemn someone who looks like the lovely young Slav pictured below is not a favorite of mine&hellip;</p>

<p>&#8220;([German Adjutant] Schulze-Kossens) All had volunteered<br/>

That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s exactly it! Envy is the core reason and motivator. Whenever you see Blacks or sometimes Hispanics with a visceral hatred and expression of disdain for Whites, you will also notice the genuine envy they have. They want to be adored, respected and admired like Whites. They with they had White people&rsquo;s hair and features along with poise and intelligence. As superficial as that sounds it is actually the underlying reasons of their intense jealousy. Why else would the Black man covet the White woman?</p>

<p>R.P.Oliver, in an article on Yockey&rsquo;s &#8221; The Enemy of Our Enemies&#8221;, states that Spengler&rsquo;s works were available in Germany until 1945. At which time, according to Oliver, Spengler&rsquo;s work was suppressed.  </p>
<p>Oliver stated that there was no official suppression of Spengler&rsquo;s work, but there was some hostility toward it, also that Spengler&rsquo;s meeting with Hitler was amicable. </p>

Spengler&rsquo;s meeting with Hitler was amicable, but not fruitful.  Oliver himself sadly degenerated in later life from erudite anti-communist articles expressed in a recognisable style, with rare words as an affectation, to writing truly bizarre stuff about Christian origins and sticking in crudely phrased references to Jews.  Yockey in my view was mistaken in trying to synthesise Spengler and Hitler.</p>

<p>Spenger had vague intimations of hyper-technology in the power of communications, which he called The Thing.  People who take much of his almost original thought as obvious or banal today forget that he started his magnum opus a century ago, for some time standing upright under a dim light, writing his brilliant prose longhand.  A great man.</p>

But as one of our top strategies, it is a fantasy. First you would need to get whites to think differently on something very deeply felt. We can&rsquo;t even get most of them to violate PC. So how long will such a project take, a few generations? We don&rsquo;t have that much time to turn demographics around and out-breed people who do it naturally, many of them not overly concerned if their ten ragamuffins are out picking through landfills. White parents just aren&rsquo;t built that way, thankfully.</p>
<p>It is pathetically comical that GOP alpha families, buttons bursting with altruistic pride, like the Bush&rsquo;s can turn themselves Hispanic or the Romney&rsquo;s can turn themselves black, when such suicidal moves will only provide further delightful fodder, spurring on even greater ridicule from the Left.</p>

<p>As far as keeping them confined, etc, this assumes that Whites will remain in political control. But given decades of open borders and high nonwhite birthrates, Whites will lose even any pretense of political control. As in Zimbabwe and South Africa, today&rsquo;s &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; for minorities will someday look like a lost paradise to minority Whites who will be legally and physically assaulted from every direction.

Why the difference? Maybe it had to do with the cohesive force of religiosity. Dad&rsquo;s family adhered to their old world spiritual tradition whose tenets are similar to LDS regarding children and family.<br/>

My uber-liberal German immigrant x-husband is so Berkeley brainwashed he will not even discuss Muslim invasion, though his family members left in Germany are livid on the subject. The Hamburg suburban greenbelt where his family had their estate is now leveled for free-loader Muslim council housing, now a no-go area for Whites.</p>

<p>Not sure why people are thumbing up such an ignorant comment. Like Thermopylae, they made the Bantu numbers count for nothing and were 4 man deep so there was no time in between reloading. Which made their firepower superiority over Speer chuckers even more significant. Technology, intelligence. That&rsquo;s how they won, not because of the tooth fairy.</p>
<p>It was 20,000 Zulus by the way. You should read up on the battle again.</p>

<p>We have to work hard to be positive and inspire our people (very broadly embracing all racially conscious Whites who honestly work for the rights of our people).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a few more Amren articles celebrating Russia and Eastern Europe&rsquo;s freedom from Bolshevism, Communism. This upcoming Russian Winter Olympics looks to be the greatest virtually all White sporting and cultural event in history.</p>
<p>Russia now has a bad a@@ Nationalist leader - Putin does just about everything I dream of doing to cultural Marxists, homosexual extremists, Islamic terrorists, traitorous oligarchs (google the phot of Putin putting the Yukos oil Oligarch in a public cage).</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t we all love to see some White American leader put Sheldon Adelsonin a cage? Sentence some lesbian punk rock band like &#8220;pussy riot&#8221; to a year&rsquo;s hard labor in Alaska?</p>
<p>I am now going with the idea that I&rsquo;m backing tough White Slavs - especially Russians and Ukranians (Serbs and Croats are also very good here in Chicago) over Nordics and sadly, my British kinfolk. You&rsquo;ll never see White Slavs fall down in to Liberalism or worse. libertarianism.</p>

<p>As for Sheldon Adelson, Donnie Moore, Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, et al., the cage sounds nice.  But I&rsquo;ll settle for a nice RICO lawsuit or prosecution which results in the forfeiture of just about all of their fortunes.</p>

<p>Whenever I begin to have feelings of resentment toward Mitt, I remember that he was on that stage calling for the deportation of illegals through attrition. That is, he was probably the last GOP nominee to ever call for the removal of the illegal Latino immigrants in this country.</p>
<p>And I look at his family. Dozens of Whites children and grandchildren. A truly successful man.</p>
<p>But this was not good enough for many on &#8220;other&#8221; sites. No - since he was a die-hard Israel supporter, they were not going to vote for him. </p>
<p>And, now look at our situation. There will never be another real contender for the Presidency who advocates deportation.</p>
<p>2012 was truly the last shot. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just move to Alaska.</p>

It is a brilliant expectation of the Cultural Marxist assault using blacks, immigrants, deviants, feminists and criminals. </p>
<p>Spengler was too attached in imagination to the Classical model and did not push to its logical extension his brilliant insight into Western civilization, with its notion of extension in time and in space, a notion that controverts his dignified position that &#8220;optimism is cowardice&#8221; and give us some hope from modern science, especially eugenics, if appropriately employed.  He also thought that the Russian culture-zone mght be the source of a final civilization.</p>

The Romney&rsquo;s may have a lot of kids but they recently adopted a big kid which I think should not be allowed in White countries. Large families are very important to our survival and we see the envy and hate of the non-whites everyday. He was right that Germany was the guardian of Europe until it was destroyed in WWI and the Austro-Hungarian Empire was the 2nd Guardian that was destroyed. This led to WWII but i agree we need a strong race and a united one at that.</p>

It also stood for &ldquo;inheritance, fecundity, and family, which three belong together;&#8221;</p>
<p> For those who say that the unmentionables were hated solely because of their success, this shows that that was not the case. A merchant minority has a value system that is at complete odds with anything close to the Prussian idea. A merchant minority that is trans national has no loyalty to a state or a nation, a merchant minority is almost exclusively interested in  monetary wealth whereas such things as homes are disposable, replaceable, not made to last. A merchant minority is never tied to any one place, it has no permanent ties to a &#8220;land&#8221;. It does not farm land, it does not manufacture things. A merchant minority merely trades things, it deals mainly in credit and money. Consumerism is the end result of merchant minorities and the crass materialism  of consumerism is at violent odds with a society that has values that are close to the Prussian idea.</p>

The Rudolf Hess flight to Scotland was the most dramatic. Churchill wanted to destroy German trade competition and did everything to get the US involved in his fight. At the end he lost the Empire, saddled Britain was in huge debt, and managed to kill over 600,000 innocent civilians in fire storms not to mention the destruction of untold cultural treasures. Now that was a real holocaust. And what came in its place is drug culture, rappers, and every perversion known to man. That&rsquo;s how smart Churchill was.<br/>
Incidentally, every time a Western politician wants to go to war he claims to be Churchillian, that it&rsquo;s 1938, and Munich all over again. Seems like the West is caught in a time warp.</p>
