<p>Like many Southerners, I am a Civil War buff; I have been reading about the war for most of my life. I had always thought that the Confederacy was defeated, after four bloody years of fighting, by the Union Army and Navy under the leadership of Lincoln, Grant, and Sherman.</p>
<p>Turns out, I was wrong. According to Professor Stephanie McCurry, who teaches history at University of Pennsylvania, what she calls the &ldquo;perfected republic of white men&rdquo; was brought down at least as much from within as from without:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new nation Confederates set out to build had fallen victim not just to enemy armies but to the manifest poverty of its reactionary vision of the republic, and the determined resistance of the Confederate people to it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bulk of this book is an attempt to show that the Confederacy&rsquo;s own women and slaves waged &ldquo;war&rdquo; against it by playing a huge &mdash; and previously ignored &mdash; role in sabotaging the war effort. Lower-class women, whose husbands were off serving in Southern armies, worked to undermine the regime, and slaves, who had always resisted the ante-bellum regime, saw the war as a new chance to win freedom. Professor McCurry criticizes previous historians for failing to consider the role of women and slaves, who made up 60 percent of the &ldquo;slave republic&rsquo;s&rdquo; population. She claims to have staked out such a &ldquo;broad set of [new] coordinates&rdquo; to explain the downfall of Dixie, that all previous works on the subject are flawed because they do not include her insights.</p>
<div id="attachment_107373" style="width: 471px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/McCurry.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-107373" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/McCurry.jpg" alt="Stephanie McCurry" width="461" height="550" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/McCurry.jpg 461w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/McCurry-251x300.jpg 251w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stephanie McCurry</p></div>
<p>Prof. McCurry&rsquo;s analysis is Marxist and feminist. She argues that two &ldquo;disdained&rdquo; and &ldquo;excluded&rdquo; classes of people in the Confederacy &mdash; non-elite women and slaves &mdash; were able to force their way into politics and destroy the Confederacy by exercising &ldquo;agency.&rdquo; &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; is a part of Critical Theory that emphasizes the previously unrecognized ability of &ldquo;historically oppressed,&rdquo; &ldquo;dis-empowered groups&rdquo; (in plain English: women and slaves) to shape their own environments, resist many of the demands of &ldquo;empowered groups&rdquo; (in plain English: white men) and make history.</p>
<p>In good, Marxist style, she also loves to call the Confederacy &ldquo;reactionary,&rdquo; adding that it was &ldquo;founded in defiance of the spirit of the age.&#8221; She considers the South solely responsible for the war, but notes happily that the &ldquo;war Confederates launched to escape history only confirmed their place in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before going further, it may be useful to have an idea of how Prof. McCurry feels about the Confederacy. On a <a href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Reckoni">C-SPAN broadcast</a> she was asked what continues to surprise her about Civil War history. She expressed her displeased astonishment that Confederate leaders were not hanged for treason (only the commandant of Andersonville prison was executed, and for murder rather than treason). She is also astonished that the Confederacy &ldquo;still enjoys such a good press&rdquo; &mdash; which is false. The Confederacy has been the object of scorn in popular culture and academia for some time. Presumably anything short of advocating mass hangings is &ldquo;good press.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Women</b></p>
<p>According to Prof. McCurry, war <i></i>dramatically altered the condition (or the potential condition &mdash; she can never quite decide) of Confederate women. At the beginning of the war they were &ldquo;ciphers,&rdquo; excluded from politics and not allowed to vote. &ldquo;Nobody thought they had anything of value to offer the state,&rdquo; she writes. But as the hardships of war affected the home front, women began to exercise &ldquo;agency.&rdquo; Alone and unsupported by husbands who had gone off to fight, they petitioned the government, with increasing stridency, for help in raising crops, buying food, or to bring their husbands home from the war. On several occasions when there were food shortages, women rioted in Atlanta and Richmond.</p>
<p>In Professor McCurry&rsquo;s eyes, these women were &ldquo;encroaching on foreign gender terrain&rdquo; and creating a &ldquo;politics of women&rdquo; (in Critical Theory, every group has its own &ldquo;politics,&rdquo; whether they know it or not). By pressuring the government they presaged a separate identity for women outside of marriage, and inside the &ldquo;body politic&rdquo; of the Confederacy, much to the dismay of Confederate officials. Prof. McCurry would love to say that the new &ldquo;politics&rdquo; sparked a feminist consciousness, but sadly admits that it did not. Still, the women&rsquo;s demands on the government, along with other more subversive actions, disrupted the Confederate war effort and contributed to defeat.</p>
<p>To give her argument the force it needs to be plausible, Dr. McCurry conflates three different groups of women, with differing attitudes toward the war and the Confederacy. To her, there is little difference between women petitioning the government for food relief, women writing to their husbands urging them to desert and come help with the crops, and women joining or supporting the outlaw bands of deserters who began to plague parts of the Confederacy beginning in 1863.</p>
<p>To begin with, the women in all three groups were a minority of Confederate women. According to University of Virginia professor Gary Gallagher, who made a study of the subject in his <i>Confederate War</i>, most women actively supported the war. They did not petition, urge desertion, or feed outlaw bands. These pro-Confederate women were not only members of the planter class, but of all ranks, including thousands of women who worked in factories producing munitions and uniforms for &ldquo;the Cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for petitioners, Prof. McCurry fails to realize that the &ldquo;newly empowered soldiers&rsquo; wives&rdquo; were not seeking political power or trying to help the Yankees win, but trying to shelter and feed their children during a chaotic war, with their husbands away at the front. It does not occur to her that the act of petitioning could have been driven by desperation rather than disloyalty.</p>
<p>Prof. McCurry also completely misunderstands the support that petitioning women and even rioters received from men &mdash; including Confederate officials of the government their actions were supposedly undermining. She thinks the men were simply intimidated, but this is not surprising in a neo-Marxist, for whom all people are merely individuals. Prof. McCurry seems to believe that people have only economic relations, that they have no connections or loyalties to each other or to a greater whole. In her ideological template, the people of the Confederacy were not bound together by ties of blood and sentiment and patriotism<i>,</i> and these bonds could not transcend class, sex, or economic interests. She does not understand that both men and women could petition the government for change and still be loyal Confederates.</p>
<p>What about women who urged their men to desert? In his history of the Army of Northern Virginia, <i>General Lee&rsquo;s</i> <i>Army</i>, Joseph Glatthaar notes that the wives who asked their men to come home often urged them to return to duty once the crops were planted or harvested. In fact, through most of the war, many deserters &mdash; in some states a majority &mdash; returned to their units. For the four-fifths of Confederate household with no slaves, a husband away in the army meant a serious labor shortage. Again, Prof. McCurry sees a desperate effort to survive as opposition to the Confederacy.</p>
<p>In her analysis of women, Dr. McCurry commits the error of which she accuses other historians &mdash; examining her subject in isolation. She considers the letters women wrote, but not the letters they received. Gary Gallagher has emphasized the positive effect of soldiers on their loved ones at home: in the heroic example they set, and in the encouraging letters they wrote to their wives, urging them to be strong and to support the war.</p>
<p><b>Slaves</b></p>
<p>In Civil War historiography, the rise of &ldquo;agency&rdquo; has replaced the long-held view that the majority of black slaves were simply pawns of the Union or Confederacy. Indeed, so the argument goes, the most potent force in freeing the slaves was not the occupation of Confederate territory by the Union army, but the efforts of the slaves themselves. They are now the leading actors in the historical drama of the Civil War.</p>
<p>Here are a few passages that illustrate Dr. McCurry&rsquo;s views:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Mississippi and Louisiana, few doubted that the war had become a slave rebellion.</p>
<p>That the Civil War was, among other things, a massive slave rebellion, seems clear in hindsight.</p>
<p>The transformation of slavery [was] initiated by slaves . . .</p>
<p>In the C.S.A., slaves quickly emerged as powerful enemies of the government, working to destroy slavery and the slaveholders&rsquo; state from within . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. McCurry therefore portrays slaves, along with women, as another great wrecking ball that tore the Confederacy apart from inside. She does not accept the idea that slaves were a net plus for the South because their agricultural labor freed many thousands of white men to fight Yankees. Without slaves, these men would have had to stay home and grow the crops the South needed to feed its armies. And yet, Dr. McCurry herself acknowledges that the Confederacy was able to mobilize a larger share of its manpower &mdash; up to 85 percent of draft age men &mdash; than any American government before or since. This was possible only because slaves kept the economy running.</p>
<p>Dr. McCurry&rsquo;s evidence of &ldquo;agency&rdquo; is mostly anecdotes: slaves refusing to work on fortifications, running away en masse from plantations, or guiding Union troops around Confederate positions. She claims that these &ldquo;insurrections&rdquo; forced the Confederate army to fight a &ldquo;two front war&rdquo; that led to its ultimate destruction.</p>
<p>Almost all these accounts come from areas occupied by or in close proximity to Union forces, mainly northern Virginia, coastal Georgia and South Carolina, and the area around New Orleans. Many accounts are from 1865, when most of the Confederacy had been invaded by Northern armies, and the rest was disintegrating.</p>
<p>Historians have always acknowledged that slaves in these areas, especially during the second half of the war, sometimes refused to work when Yankee armies drew near, and were quick to run away. But one would expect to see some basic data to support the claim that black slaves were the authors of their own emancipation, and played a huge, perhaps even decisive, role in bringing down the Confederacy.</p>
<p>How many slaves did the South use to build fortifications and how many deserted or refused to work? How many, or what percentage, of slaves left plantations for Union lines? How many stayed? Dr. McCurry is either uninterested in such questions, or doesn&rsquo;t like the answers. In fact, the South made extensive and well documented use of slave labor to build fortifications throughout the war.</p>
<p>Dr. McCurry also ignores the thousands of black servants, cooks, teamsters and nurses who accompanied Confederate armies in the field. According to one respected expert, Allen C. Guelzo, Lee&rsquo;s army may have brought as many as 30,000 slaves into Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg campaign. They would certainly have been left behind if slave desertion was as big a problem as Dr. McCurry claims.</p>
<p>Despite Dr. McCurry&rsquo;s claim, noted above, that the war became &ldquo;a massive slave rebellion,&rdquo; the author she cites for the most detailed account of slaves &ldquo;at war&rdquo; with their masters, William Dusinberre, flatly disagrees: &ldquo;Not a single substantial slave insurrection occurred in the United States [including the Confederacy] between 1831 and 1865.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulysses S. Grant himself recognized the importance of slaves to the Southern war effort. As he explained in an 1878 interview with the <i>New York Tribune</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>4,000,000 negroes kept the farms, protected the families, supported the armies, and were really a reserve force . . . never counted in any summary of the forces of the South.</p></blockquote>
<p>Grant certainly did not think the slaves were an important ally in the fight to crush the Confederacy.</p>
<p>Why should anyone pay attention to a book like <i>Confederate Reckoning? </i>It is not for the general public, and is written in the turgid jargon favored by modern academics. Its arguments are ridiculous. Still, <i>Confederate Reckoning</i> is sure to be assigned in undergraduate and graduate courses, and will help shape the minds of teachers and professors. And these people will shape the minds of students.</p>
<p>More importantly, <i>Confederate Reckoning </i>is no outlier in Civil War studies. Dr. McCurry&rsquo;s hostility to the Confederacy and her desire fantastically to expand the role of black slaves in the War Between the States, is probably shared by the majority of professional historians working in the field today. Over the past 50 years, they have re-written Civil War history to fit the ideology of multiculturalism.</p>
<p><i>Confederate Reckoning</i> is an instructive example of that process.</p>
<p><i>In a future article Gerald Martin will consider in more detail the takeover by multiculturalism of Civil War history.</i><i></i></p>

<p> &#8221; there are plenty of conservative women so one can not judge women by the leftist women&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, truth is that when speaking of women, the MAJORITY is ALWAYS leftist. The percentage of race realist, or conservative females is always in the minority, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter at all if you can point to one individual female that may be in line with us, letting women be part of the political, academic or media is ALWAYS going to feminize things and drag it to the left. A TRULY conservative female would be aware of this, and would not halve a problem with letting men run things. She would not have a problem with it because she knows that letting women be involved will destroy conservatism, destroy race realism, destroy a people. Another truth is that while there may be some leftist crazy men, the majority of men, even with the feminization that has taken place,will always vote more conservatively, more for their race.<br/>
A truly race realist woman would have no problem at all in what I say, she would know that the GOAL is more important than her EGO!</p>

<p>A big majority of woman, of liberals, of intellectuals, of Jews have really created the mess we are in. Because of greed, pathological altruism, wishful thinking, naivety, projection, self-hatred. It is okay to point this out.</p>
<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t think education of women is a waste of time. I think the mess is because of emotional and one-sided education. Similarly I don&rsquo;t agree with those saying European Jews are not White (or wanting to kill them all) or saying intellect people are traitors.</p>
<p>Thanks to remain polite Max Krakah (I still don&rsquo;t really understand but somebody on Amren has been quite strong with his language towards me because I am a woman! I would think we can disagree and still know we are a group, moreover as long as we are a minority and so much attacked. Also although I disagree with acting on the following I will still say that yes, whites can make it without Jews and intellectuals but LOL they can&rsquo;t make it without women)</p>

<p>Women are definitively more emotional and naive. It&rsquo;s in our genes, our hormones (not a social construct LOL.) I also think it is a age thing. As I wrote in the past, I was a victim of the diversity liberalist secular religion when I was young. Maturity, wisdom, past errors, open-mindness made me realize the truth about many issues I have been brainwashed with. I am lucky that I am happily married with a white man and I am educating my children properly. By the way, I am enlightening my hubby about white racialism, you&rsquo;re welcome!</p>
<p>Yes, men need women for more than just a physical thing, and women need men for more than that too! 🙂 I agree with what you say, it was hard for me to accept all this. It took me time, but I did. It&rsquo;s not fair for the women, but it is better for everybody: for the men, the women, the children and society. I still see myself as a strong woman. Not trying to be offensive, just an analogy: is the horse less strong after being broken/trained? </p>
<p>I think that making young women understand what you say is harder than making them race realists. Becoming a racialist has made me become a better woman/wife, so I presume this could be the way to do. Race is the big picture, the corner stone, the wedge/key stone. If one understands this, then their thoughts could be well adjusted, at least better. A group understanding this, stronger. A civilization, invincible. A race, proud. Immortal.</p>
<p>I am not trying to please anyone. I am genuine. I am still working on myself, it is not easy (I don&rsquo;t know if it is not easy because of my previous thinking or if it was never easy for most women but we did it, by choice or not)</p>

The communists assaulted the old values, they ridiculed religion. they took God away, they corrupted society with pornography. When men do not serve what is RIGHT, women see this, and detest them. A woman will take &#8220;NO&#8221; from a man when she sees he is on the right path, she will not when she sees he is detestable and weak for his pleasures, weak for her, weak for his alcohol, weak for his sports, weak for his TV.<br/>
WE have been reduced to the point where the only remaining area of masculinity in our culture is &#8220;sports&#8221;. But there was a time when before professional baseball and football when men were extremely masculine and these things were just one expression of that.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-417684" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I wrote a post a couple of days ago, I am not sure if it was to answer this one or another of yours. Anyway, my computer crashed and I lost it. Argh! I don&rsquo;t remember all now, I will make one of my point in brief:</p>
<p>When I was visiting islamocritical websites (&#8220;islam a religion of peace&#8221; was one of the first liberal dogma, that I checked and saw as a lie. This was a catalyst for me to check all the other dogmas, included &#8220;race is a social construct&#8221;, and that journey brought me here), so when I was visiting those sites, there was always this question being asked: why do European women go with muslims? Despite rejecting then the logic, I already knew back then, long before I became a racialist, that many women deep inside, do want strong men to be their protector, a pillar in the family and they do like when their boyfriend/husband wants to be their sole admirer, to ask them to wear more humble clothes and to bear them children etc and they misinterpretate muslims as proposing them those things. Erroneously as there is much more and much less the muslims are &#8220;offering&#8221;.</p>
<p>Indeed nowadays white men are ripped off their white masculinity (strong but respectful, leader and partner) and white women miss it and fall for ersatz that are destructive (mysogyn and exploiting, authoritarian and seeing women and non-muslims as deficient) or annihilating (with even farther genetically non-white).</p>
<p>Argh, I just don&rsquo;t remember what I wrote else&hellip;</p>
<p>Was nice speaking with you.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-414202" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Men, especially since the 60s have abdicated their natural position of leader and are now creatures that seek &#8220;mommys&rsquo; approval. They are afraid to be seen as &#8216;harsh, &#8220;unkind&#8221;, &#8220;uncaring&#8221; &#8220;mean&#8221; etc. Many men today live under this constant threat that they will not live up to what &#8220;mommy&#8221; wants. Therefore we have people like Sean Hannity.<br/>
This started in the 50s but really became prevalent in the sixties with the peace movement when the men in the military were vilified and the peacenik hippies became the new ideal. Before this phenomenon men had a &#8220;world of their own&#8221; where their values were shaped by their male peers, NOT their women! Women LIKE men like this, They do not really care for or respect men that are weak for them. They do not really want a grown man that seeks their approval as the measure of what is right or wrong. They secretly have contempt and distaste for their metrosexual men. They want to be told no, but at the same time they have such a contradictory nature that they will not take &#8220;no&#8221; easily. They will go through a period of anger and resentment and the man has to be strong enough to deal with this without becoming angry or hating the woman.<br/>
To create a white ethno state will require men to stand up and be willing to face the disapproval of women. This will NEVER come from the run of the mill republican men. The only strategy I see that would be successful would be for a stealth ( white) male government to get elected . Perhaps a republican candidate but perhaps it could be a democrat even. Once in power, such a person could then make moves to deal with the issue of race, and a bad economy, by taking &#8220;emergency measures&rsquo;, which, with the precedent of &#8220;executive order&#8221; already being set could be quite easy. These measures would be designed to foment unrest in the minority populations. To deal with that a state of unrest martial laws could be declared. Then all Equal opportunity laws and AA laws could be immediately revoked, politicians removed from office and replaced with agents of the new government, All elections suspended for an unspecified time. BUT, at the same time a form of representation could be give to white males in the army. So in reality voting is restricted to white males while people are told that general elections are suspended until social order is stabilized. The media could be immediately seized, the present civil law courts shut down. Divorce laws changed drastically and men given power over their families again.<br/>
I believe the white world&rsquo;s days were numbered the minute we gave women the right to vote. Each generation of women pushed things a little further. We are at the point now where we are at the precipice. Women do not have children, when they do they often take them away from their father. The family is all but destroyed, or hanging by a thin thread. The dream of a white ethnostate will not just happen, and it will not happen unless women are taken out of the decision process.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-414389" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I agree with much of what you say, but think you should consider propaganda,, reality, and how to work it in our favor. We have to work with what we have and use it and direct it toward the world we want. The individual may be masculine, but the psyche of the masses is feminine. It always has been. This is why God&rsquo;s people as a group and the church are referred to in the feminine vernacular. True, the desire is for masculine leadership, but it is not obtained in the ways suggested. On a side note, I would assert that many women in the past took great disdain at manhood being given preference over womanhood in regard to race. Why were black men given governance (vote) over white women simply because they were men. I think many viewed this as a slap in the face. WN&rsquo;s need to focus more on race and the family dynamic without putdowns of either sex. I have always made it a personal point not to put down men in general for traits that are masculine, but rather to appreciate the complimentary nature of men and women. As far as men doing what is right despite the approval of the women in their lives, I agree completely. I have always been dismayed by WN men who don&rsquo;t want their girlfriends or wives to find out about their beliefs or association with different WN groups. I always advise them in the case of girlfriends to state their beliefs and if the ideas are rejected than to break up immediately. In the case of a wife, I don&rsquo;t view divorcing her as an option, but neither is silence. The wife needs to see that his beliefs have merit and often that will only happen if he remains firm in his positions and takes her femininity into consideration. In other words, formulate your views in conversation with her in a way that she can understand. Sometimes, it isn&rsquo;t the views that a woman finds scary (if articulated correctly) but fear that her man is caught up in some kind of terrorist activity and about to be pounced on by the FBI. Isn&rsquo;t that what the movies tell us. As far as female white nationalists, I have known quite a few who had they same issues with their husband or boyfriend. Boyfriend has to be dumped, but not the husband. This is where the tried and true advice of winning your husband over by your behavior (St.Paul) comes into play. While some men may not care if his woman has a brain or not or views any attempt at using her intellectual capacity, most men appreciate a woman of conviction. He won&rsquo;t be won over by nagging, but by they way she lives an honorable and noble life dedicated to white Christian revival.</p>
<p>Allow me to point out what the left knows too well and has exploited with tremendous success. Men may be the leaders of the families (even today if only in theory), they are still expected to be the protectors (even left leaning women want men to protect them if not in theory than in practice) but women are the gatekeepers to the family. This is something the NRA has recently figured out. Teach a man to hunt and a man hunts, teach a woman to hunt and the whole family hunts. Everyone in the WN movement wants to save white families and some believe only men are up to the task. The problem is that it just isn&rsquo;t going to happen. The movement won&rsquo;t save white families, white families will save the movement, promote it, propagate it, and make it central to lives of other white families. This is the nucleus of a new white ethno-state (nation) The movement needs strong white families and this means women too. Men and women working together with their different attributes will place the proper focus back on families. Family is the incubator of future WNs. I suggest that we look past our personal grievances with either sex and not play the enemy&rsquo;s handbook of dividing our race along gender lines. This doesn&rsquo;t mean we feminize the movement, but it does mean begin looking at ways to make family the central theme and that includes writings, speeches, and conferences. Too many look at conferences as a weekend away from the wife and kids or &#8220;man&#8221; work. Conferences should focus on families. When you have a family environment you will have more single women and more single women means potential marriage partners for single white men. </p>
<p>Remember that the enemy has told the public the following: we hate non-whites and we hate women. Now, I know there is a time for hate, but our enemy didn&rsquo;t get to this point through tough sounding rhetoric. They used a softer language that cloaked their true desire. Do I hate non-whites? No. Do I want them here? No. Our movement is falling into a trap by appearing to be anti-women. They are not countering the enemies lies, they are validating it much of the time. They group non-whites, homosexuals, and women together in language the majority of the time until it just rolls off the tongue. </p>
<p>By promoting family rather than an agenda that is pro-man or pro-woman, we can circumvent our enemies propaganda tactics. We have to reframe our approach and propaganda (marketing) In think the WN movement is moving in the right direction, but individual adherents must have an understanding also.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-414434" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Ahhh!!! great discussion sir  &mdash;  you and Rachel have just been added to my favorites list  &mdash;  -a couple of people who THINK!! We are not as far apart in our beliefs as you might think at the moment  &mdash;  it is difficult to express oneself in a short narrative. I ask you to look at Proverbs 31:3 and Proverbs 31:10. It blends in with this discussion very well but you both know that to quote the Bible is going to turn off many of our friends on this website. Let me say up front that I am not a preacher-my vices are too numerous so I leave that vocation to someone of more noble character. I do believe however that no matter how arrogant or learned man becomes he will eventually return to that Source of Knowledge to find answers to the mess that mankind has gotten himself into. Max, you are absolutely right that a man has to stand for what is right and stand by his convictions even unto death. I can think of no more noble mortal than Robert E. Lee-read his book on leadership!, what made men like this great is that they had views similar to what you have expressed and they lived a life based on their convictions. He and Stonewall Jackson were both men to emulate-their faith gave them supreme courage to face death many times without fear but they both knew the importance of having a good woman by their side. But GOOD is the key word here-read Proverbs 31:10 again to get my definition of a good woman. Men and women need each other, I believe, to find real happiness  &mdash;  without that life is pretty empty-this I can tell you from experience cause I never found that virtuous woman but plenty of the other kind, creating a view of women very similar to yours Max. I am an old man now and cynical but after reading Rachel&rsquo;s letter maybe there is still hope.</p>

<p>Just choose a lady who doesn&rsquo;t think it is wrong to be proud about her heritage and wants children AND children who will look like her. A lady who is willing to question everything. And built from there. A book here, a trip to that neighborhood there, slowly she can wake up to the truth, I would say there is a need for a few months of exchange. Sometimes, the racialist thoughts are there, but repressed. It can take<br/>
her to go through the phases of grief: shock, denial, pain, anger, bargaining,<br/>

The exception does not prove the rule, and the exceptions are mercilessly tormented, hounded and shunned. Women value conformity, a rigid social order where independent and dissenting thought is cruelly mocked, and the vast majority think with their emotions, not their brains. Why do you think the modern, woman-dominated society is in the shape it&rsquo;s in? Women agitate for aid to useless eaters, believe the &#8220;we&rsquo;re all the same&#8221; propaganda because it&rsquo;s feel-good and warm/fuzzy, and refuse to open their eyes and see reality. I don&rsquo;t think I have ever had an intellectual conversation with any other woman (except maybe my mother and grandmother), and almost every single conversation with another woman is them talking smack about people they know, what&rsquo;s on TV, or what material, status-seeking item they want their husband/boyfriend to buy them to &#8220;prove his love&#8221;. They also fell for the lie of feminism, and the especially odious and damaging lie of &#8220;sexual freedom&#8221;&hellip;which I guess is part of feminism, but it&rsquo;s so damaging and destructive to women, yet they line up to let men use them then toss them aside like garbage! Then they think that once THEY are ready to settle down (after having been used by tons of men) that some decent man will want them! THAT mindset is what makes me think most women are hopeless and must be stupid. Sorry to any women here that aren&rsquo;t that way, I know there are good women out there&hellip;.I just haven&rsquo;t met any yet.</p>

<p>What is always left out of the narrative is that some slaves were so well treated that they were undyingly loyal to their slave master&rsquo;s family. This is also why many slaves upon hearing they were free decided to stay on with the the White families and become sharecroppers.</p>
<p>Many poor White families were subsistence farmers and had it much worse than those slaves that were treated well.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-412583" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Very good point. Black African chattel slavery in the United States was a vast institution. It covered a quarter of a continent, encompassed centuries of time, and, at the time of the Civil War, 4,000,000 slaves and about 12,000,000 whites living in slave states. Any generalization about slavery is bound to fail.</p>
<p>When I visited the historic Berkeley Plantation in Virginia, I paid careful attention to its total layout and how it must have functioned as a farm in the slavery era. Where the slave quarters must have been was steps away from the front door of the house. I wasn&rsquo;t born yesterday. In reporting this my impressions, I cryptically described this locale as the home of &#8220;slavery at its good-hearted best&#8221;. It was still slavery, and slavery had a much uglier face in other places. But we weren&rsquo;t there, and don&rsquo;t know how life played out day to day. For most of the human race throughout most of the history of organized society, caste systems, often ethnically based, have been the norm. People deal it and manage to preserve themselves somehow on both sides of the line.</p>

A modern example is the oil-rich Gulf States as detailed in &#8220;Far From Home&#8221; in the January 2014 issue of National Geographic. 89 percent of the population of both Quatar and the United Arab Emirates, for example, are imported.

But perhaps past caste systems have originated in these types of situations. Usually, caste corresponds to division of labor. American slavery was a true color caste system, one with a legal existence. Color caste exists extensively in Latin America and the Caribbean, but based on the force of custom, not force of law.</p>

A passport generally would allow that, but it could be prevented even with one. Whoever first said &#8220;Prison Planet&#8221; had it right.</p>
<p>Even in the United States, the extent to which people who are not identifiably part of the gentrified middle class might not be able to travel to or live in any desirable country is not well publicized. Most never try it because they do not have the money, if for no other reason. But if they did try it, they might be in for a surprise.</p>

If they were hurt or old, they weren&rsquo;t thrown in the street to starve. Compare this to the Irish immigrant working up North in a textile mill or coal mine, starting at 12 years, and discarded by the business owner if they got hurt. For people on the left side of the bell curve, and given the overall living standards of the time, it wasn&rsquo;t the absolute worst situation, and some of them realized it.

That would have made the war last years longer, and would have been a tragedy for both sides.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-413403" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There is a new book out by yet another of these PC civil war historians which attempts to show that Lee was trying to &#8220;seize the narrative&#8221; at Appomattox, in ascribing Confederate defeat to the overwhelming numbers of Yankees. She (forgot her name at the moment) alleges that Lee was trying to evade acknowledgement that the Confederacy&rsquo;s own sins brought it down (similar to Prof. McCurry&rsquo;s thesis), and was a key figure in establishing the &#8220;Myth of the Lost Cause,&#8221; which is viewed by PC historians as a Big Lie and (of course) wildly racist. This woman also claims that it was the USCTs (United States Colored Troops) who defeated the Army of Northern Virginia in its last battle, thus forcing it to surrender to Grant.<br/>
I will have more to say about this book in an essay about the transformation of Civil War history into something which accords with multicultural dogma, but thought I&rsquo;d give you a heads up. It is another attempt to erase from the public (white) mind anything in our history we can be proud of.   &mdash;   Gerald</p>

Besides resenting Lee&rsquo;s iconic status with almost all Southerners &amp; many Northerners, she objects to the lack of contrition in his famous farewell statement to the Army of Northern Virginia, which praised his troops, and referred to the overwhelming Northern advantage in manpower and resources as the cause of its ultimate defeat.<br/>
Many PC historians of today are enraged by the South&rsquo;s failure to grovel, apologize, and admit the war was all their fault after it was over. That the South was prostrate, economically ruined, with hundreds of thousands dead, means little to them.</p>

My grandfather was born in 1875, just at the end of reconstruction. His father lived through the war ( too young to fight in it) but passed on his memories and experiences of the war years and the era of reconstruction. He said that reconstruction was even worse than the war an many ways. The Union soldiers were brutal and continued to rape and murder even after the war. Many of the former slaves were taken into the army and they were the worst by far  &mdash;  the Negro has always been of a savage nature!! White men could not vote or hold public office for a long time and my great-grandfather said it was ten years of pure hell. It has never ended!!, consider the book this evil woman has written like so many others that are being printed. Look at the absolute garbage Hollywood continues to pour out-I think two about Abe Lincoln as a vampire slayer-of course the vampires are Confederates. The new Lincoln movie by Spielberg is pure garbage so I am told-I refuse to spend money on this crap so I rely heavily on reviews, but you get the picture. The real question is WHY? The South has had no political power for 150 years-yes some of our SCALAWAG traitors have made it to the White House-but they do not represent us in any way-they are scum!! What is it that the Ruling Elite fear from us that they have to keep up the propaganda and hatred-a hatred that is still strong among many people in the North sad to say. The liberal propaganda has so damaged our society down here that it is hard for me to believe we will ever recover  &mdash;  but apparently there are those who still think we need to be punished even more. I just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>

No matter how hard I tried I found it nearly impossible to get along with some of them. Not all were bad,fortunately, and I enjoyed 15 years in that beautiful country. I am back in the South now and will never leave it again-getting ready for Civil War #2-I just don&rsquo;t think the South will ever accept the Marxism that has been pushed down our throats for the last 150 years. I could be wrong though  &mdash;  the propaganda has definitely had an affect, mostly on our women. You Southern girls out there-wake up!! we&rsquo;re gonna need you real soon I think.</p>

<p>One nuance with your words that struck me. In the recent past you rarely saw women posting on boards like these. Now you see them here and other blogs like the Daily Caller. I think that is significant.</p>
<p>Hetero/middle-age/white/males are the obvious posters here because that demographic is the consistent target by the Cultural Marxists and their hate purges at employers. White women have always gotten a pass, but now they see themselves displaced by incompetent minority women and they are starting to understand that the white woman is the next target as the haters go down the list.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been the victim of reverse discrimination dating back to the 1980&rsquo;s. White women are just starting to realize that they are next.</p>

The Natives were a different matter altogether-very racist against all whites. They like the blacks down here enjoyed the backing of the Federal Gov. in almost everything-jobs, housing, special hunting and fishing privileges, you name it. Alaskans tend to be more socially liberal but very pro-2nd amendment. They vote mostly Republican but usually support liberal ideas such as abortion, gay rights, and they really love blacks. I knew one retired State Trooper up there who believed anyone who used the &#8220;n&#8221; word should go to prison but at the same time he was very prejudiced against the Natives. This is a broad generalization I give here and many no doubt would rebut it- Alaska is a near perfect example of what a multiculturalist society is like  &mdash;  confusing and screwed up!! Those are just my views on the matter and I could be wrong. Also there is a shortage of women up there  &mdash;  better to take one with you if you can keep her. She will have ample opportunity to dump you for someone else-but as women up there said in reference to finding a man  &mdash;  &#8221; the odds are good but the goods are ODD&#8221;!!.</p>

Even Jefferson Davis wanted to get rid of slavery eventually, but not without moving the slaves out of the U.S. They were trying to protect themselves from black dysfunction, which was held in check by slavery. I wonder if Prof McCurry will ever recognize that the Southerners who did not own slaves were not dupes, but rational men who could figure out how bad things would get with unconditional abolition.</p>

<p>Hence they have a compulsive need to re-define reality (and history) to conform to their beliefs.

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s become trendy to write alternative histories because they get noticed. Despite the silliness, Mr. McCurry will be taken seriously by liberals who can&rsquo;t face reality.</p>

I know of a similar situation. During WW2, my grandfather was in the Pacific, and around early &rsquo;45 my g-grandparents wrote a hardship letter to the War Dept asking for my granddad to be sent home (they had four sons, all in the Army, and my granddad was the youngest). They were barely scraping by on the farm and it cost a lot to hire someone then because of the labor shortage. My granddad was permitted to go but refused, until he and his buddies could finish it out and go back together, which is understandable but I don&rsquo;t think he realized how desperate it was back home. So they got one of his brothers to return early to help with the planting.</p>

For someone to have that bravery under withering fire and grapeshot, you&rsquo;d have to have some sympathy. Back in those days, men were still men, whether Reb or Fed.</p>

The hidden agenda is to sow even more seeds of distrust between white men and women today. I can say without doubt that my Alabama ancestral women were 100 percent loyal to their men, just as they are today. The other thing is where in the book is the story of the &#8220;speculators&#8221; who hoarded food for profit, while good women and children starved. These traitors to the South owed their loyalty to their Tribe, I&rsquo;ll betcha.</p>

He was a guerilla leader against the Brits and New Englanders in Acadia during the French and Indian War in the 1750s, before being captured. Unlike most Acadians, he wasn&rsquo;t shipped out. He left voluntarily, not wanting to live under British subjugation. His brother Alexandre had been captured, sent off to prison in South Carolina, escaped, and hoofed it back to Canada to resume fighting. He was in his late 50s or 60s.

My only concern was the reference to Major Henry Wirz being executed for &#8220;murder.&#8221; Wirz was given a sham trial and framed for crimes he did not commit. He was a scapegoat to satiate the wrath of the North for the high death rate at Andersonville Prison   &mdash;   a death rate resulting from the North stopping the prisoner exchange, confiscating and destroying all medicines in the South, and neglecting to come and get the prisoners when offered without a reciprocal exchange.</p>

I have not been able to find a cite to back that up. Do you have one? I agree that Wirz was a scapegoat, as much for Union prison commandants as for any Confederates. When one adds up the number of Confederate prisoners who died of disease and malnutrition in Chicago (80 Acres of Hell), Elmira, NY, and other places, I think they rank up there with the deaths at Andersonville, a number of which were due to tragic errors in the initial layout of the prison camp.</p>

James Madison Page, &#8220;The True Story of Andersonville Prison.&#8221; Page also stated that Wirz paroled five Union POWs to go to Washington and plead for a prisoner exchange, in order to relieve the camp of his over population. Andersonville was not poorly designed, it was designed to hold a certain number of prisoners while awaiting exchange. When the North stopped the exchange, the prison population swelled to a much larger number, and overcrowding and disease killed many of the prisoners.</p>

I imagine it does not get the same attention as &#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221; and the like. As for the layout of the camp, I think I read somewhere (sorry, sloppy about my authority) that it turned out that the privies were located in a way that the fecal matter contaminated the ground water, but by the time they realized what had happened, the prison was, as you point out, too crowded, and they lacked the manpower to do anything about it. Based on what I read, that contributed to the disease.</p>

After traveling extensively in Southern USA, touring<br/>
C/War Sites, falling in love with the food, [except for grits], architecture, festivals, music, remote mountains, hollers and forests, I call it, &#8220;the war of Northern Aggression.&#8221; I am proud of you Rebs; it was worth fighting for.<br/>
Visited Andersonville, GA as a pilgrimage in honor of my maternal great great great uncle, a Union captive who lived through imprisonment there. His very formal letters home to &#8220;dear father&#8221; are among my genealogical artifacts. Uncle R. seemed to understand that his captors were suffering too. He did mention appreciation for the gracious Southern ladies who brought in food when they could spare it. For some reason Wirz eventually put a stop to that. </p>

Some time back, I posted an 1865 letter written home by one of my Union uncles serving in GA. In the letter he describes a sneak attack axe murder of an officer by a marauding black.

Ask her who her heroes are, and she&rsquo;ll probably name Gloria Allred, Andrea Dworkin, and Hanoi Jane Fonda. </p>
<p>One of the main reasons the South lost the War of Northern Aggression is simply because General Lee was tired of fighting. Most of the early Civil War films depict Southern soldiers falling dead all over the battlefields, when in truth, they outfought a far better equipped Union Army and were vastly outnumbered. Had General Lee took General Longstreet&rsquo;s advice at Gettysburg, the war would have ended much differently.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, President Lincoln and his generals are war criminals who waged war on their own people, and they unleashed the Black Plague in America.</p>
<p>This woman is just another in a long line of unhinged, radical bra burners. She&rsquo;s waging war on America, the liberal way. She is just another traitor allowed to spread lies, and this is the liberal version of free speech and &#8220;freedom of expression&#8221;.</p>

<p>If Prof. McCurry wants to study far better examples of female Civil War influence, she should examine the influence northern women on starting the war. While women had no direct political power, they had considerable influence in the Protestant churches. These churches were hotbeds of Abolitionism. She could probably fill a volume on the actions and accomplishments of Harriet Beecher Stowe.</p>

I have read more books on the Civil War than a freight train can haul, but this little 75 page book has some of the best information on the real causes of the war than any I have read. It was carefully planned and carried out by a handful of Northern industrialists who fomented hatred between the two factions. They backed the writing and printing of Stowe&rsquo;s little piece of fiction with tons of money and mass marketing. To sum it up  &mdash;  it was a bankers war-an elaborate attempt to take over and control the U.S. economy. The South stood in the way of this takeover and had to be eliminated. Great little book  &mdash;  gives a deeper perspective on the complexity of that bloody disaster!!</p>

It is sad that people from other parts of the world know more truth about the Civil War than we do. I became obsessed with the history of that era as a young man-I am now 63 and continue to learn more all the time. I wish I knew how many books I have read over the years-most were propaganda though and it took a long time and a lot of researching to start getting some of the facts. Happily I can say that over the last 20 years or so we have begun to see some good literature and the truth is coming out. This has got to be the reason the liberals are frantically turning out so much anti-south garbage. If the American people learned the truth and found out that our government since 1865 has been nothing but organized crime-writ large-we might see an awakening they could not control.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-416826" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The book you speak of sounds interesting. That reminds me, I have always felt the Radical Republicans were behind Lincoln&rsquo;s death, after all the South didn&rsquo;t benefit from it, but the radicals would and did. I guess I was trying to speak to the notion that in the end all wars are about money/power and the *the forces of power in power at any given time* who inflict these wars upon humanity for power and profit. It is interesting that what we are taught in terms of public education always represent those same *forces of power in power*. America&rsquo;s current President has slyly chosen Bill Ayers (former Weatherman with blood on his hands) to a high post with regard to the implimentation of education in America. And of course the President himself is merely a pawn. But as to that letter from Marx, no I do not think it odd most people do not know about it. I am surprised you do. The history of the world, even the history of our country contains so much *information* not to mention propaganda, and then again simple points of view who can know it all? It can&rsquo;t be taught. It is such a complicated thing, history. How can it be written objectively? Robert Penn Warren said history should be forgotten and each generation should start anew. But then he changed his mind a number of times about a number of things. Do you really think we are getting more *truth* now? I wonder. I do see the end of the American Civil War as the most radical expansion of Federal Powers/centralized government, and expecially the 1960s and &rsquo;70s with Johnson&rsquo;s Great Society plan. It *should* have worked, and yet it did not. I think the *whys* of that failure very interesting. Yes, the South has been &#8220;sitting on the stool of everlasting repentence&hellip;&#8221; much too long.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-416897" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>J.R. Graham also wrote another very large tome &#8220;Principals of Confederacy&#8221; in which he states that yes Lincoln was killed by his own people-Edwin Stanton- in particular. Former president James Buchannan even believed that to be true. Lincoln, while he lived was a much hated man but after his assassination was literally deified by none other than Stanton and other members of his administration who hated him. True history is hard to find because objectivity is almost impossible-emotions get in the way of facts. The unique thing about the American Civil War is the interest it evoked from other countries. Tons of information and opinion from mostly Europeans are available if you look for it and that is where I get much of my info. They could be more objective because they didn&rsquo;t really have a dog in the fight so to speak. So many letters written by military men and civilians who lived through the war are also good sources of finding the truth. I also have over the years just kinda sat back and studied human nature. The people of the South are very different from the North even though we sometimes share the same ethnicity. I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand how that can be but it just is-once again its hard to be objective because my emotions tie me to the South. I honestly think that secession is the only hope this country has to get us out of this mess  &mdash;  power has to be wrested from D.C. or we as a nation are going to crash and burn and real soon. We are indeed living in interesting times-I think in the next five or six years we will see some very unpleasant things unless more people wake up to our plight-and waking up in my opinion begins with finding the truth about what really happened between 1860-1865. If I am wrong then tell me why the Ruling Elite are so desperately waging their war against a people who were conquered 150 years ago. What is it about that event that keeps them churning out more and more propaganda. How does it, or does it, tie in with the problems with black America, feminism, PC, and all the other liberal insanities that have transformed our nation into a cesspool of rankness. Interesting times indeed-hope we live through it!!</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-417431" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yes, Stanton. His hatred of the South was absolutely pathological, as was Thad Stephens. Hatred is an interesting emotion and a powerful *tool*. Like you, I could not begin to recall the books I have read on this topic alone. You are right, many European folk know a good deal about our Civil War. I would venture to say that holding a total unbiased view point is inherenty impossible, and for many simply undesirable. I must say that I try to be as objective as possible for the simple reason that it appears to me to be irrational to do other wise. But, my dna seems to fight me constantly, and that might not be so very bad in some ways. My personal experiences cause me to believe there is a difference between people of the North and the South. The essential difference lessens with time and the mobility of individuals. An agrarian people do differ from and industrial people, and time has altered much of that for good or bad. Among the old people, we see a much clearer difference. I read Faulkner and I can feel it, I read Henry James and I can imagine it. Secession is certainly an alternative, and perhaps one that may happen whether or not one wishes it. Yes, *we are living in interesting times*! I am certain we are seeing and living very unpleasant things right now. I especially noticed it beginning in earnest and overtly in the early 1990&rsquo;s. It is possible that I may have a different notion of *the Ruling Elite* than you. I see this, more and more of late, in terms of a *Hostile Elite* which may or may not be a distinction you might see or choose to see. To my lights I see this from a much more distant past, but certainly that movement/ideology was held by many European Industrialists and then American Northern Industralists(or I should say against the back drop of industrialism) and morphed again in the European wars against their monarchs, then moving to America leading especially up to WWI and spreading to America quite throughly afterwards. I was interested when I found out years ago that for a short while Karl Marx had his headquarters in New York City as the guest of Mr. Rutgers (founder of that college)&hellip;seems like it was in the 1880&rsquo;s. To the South-bashing you speak of&hellip;it&rsquo;s reoccurance began during the early Civil Rights Movement in the late 1950-early1960s, heating up off and on up to the 1990&rsquo;s then and all out war of propaganda since. I think the latest resurgance has to do with the far left&rsquo;s determination to destroy regionalism ( Southern Regionalism especially) in order to destroy it&rsquo;s ultimate target, ie Nationalism. The ultimate uber target is and has been White Nationalism, hence the slogan at Harvard&rsquo;s *Destroy the white race*. Once elements of nationalism aka patriotism are eliminated, then all national boarders can be wiped away&hellip;then the global empire of the world&rsquo;s ruling elite will be established. The forces of power in power will stop at nothing to end white unity, seen and taught as the most evil force the earth has ever known&hellip;and it ties in with the application of Critical Theory of the very people and groups and institutions you mention. You say &#8220;How does it, or does it,(yes it does!) tie in with the problems with black America, feminism, PC, and all the other liberal insanities that have transformed our nation into a cesspool of rankness.&#8221; Yes, but to these forces this *cesspool of rankness* is their symbol of victory over the White Race Elite or simply victory over the oppressive White Man. I would simply say that IF the white race is evil and IF the white man is evil, then give me that to which I can at least relate! Ha&hellip;</p>

All that has been covered up by court historians like the lady above who get well paid to continue the propaganda. Also interesting is that it was, to a great extent, Jewish merchants who owned the slave ships in Europe.

Feminism in the late 1800s was a reaction to living in a society where they had to work in factories in the North with little or no economic power, and a great multitude of women after the Civil War had no husbands North and South. Modern feminism is altogether different and quite hostile to the white race. One wonders why the white man allowed the circumstances to exist that would bring about such a movement. The white man, perhaps unknowingly, did not raise the women of his own race quickly enough to be his equal, but waited until 75 years after the black man was given the vote over the women of his own race. Perhaps the historical white woman considered this a rank betrayal leading to the distrust of the men of her own race? After all, the only sure way to finally and forever put an end to the White Man is to DIVIDE the women of his race.</p>

<p>Yes hyper masculinity.<br/>
But I don&rsquo;t know about the overcompensation for a feminine self identity and the rest.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-414250" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Sexual attraction is always towards an opposite, or a perceived opposite. The French have a word for sexual climax &#8220;little death-petite mort&#8221;. It is a little known that the threat of death, such as being put before a firing squad, will often sexually arouse and sometimes cause climax. Sexual arousal and personal annihilation are intimately linked. Attraction to an opposite excites or arouses the same way the threat of death does.Union with one&rsquo;s opposite implies self obliteration. A man will not desire another man unless he sees that man as an opposite of himself. Gays are well known to be much more narcissistic. They can have a dual identity and be in love with themselves. They can see they are male, but at the same time really have a female self identity. Whether one homosexual becomes effeminate while the other becomes hyper masculine may have something to do with which parent was the cause of the disorder. Did the child never separate from the mother- and end up having a totally female self identity, or did the child partially separate from the mother, but was rejected by the father- in which case the child would fixate on the masculine. In both cases though, they have a female self identity.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-415746" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Most women of the South were in fact married to non-slaveholding farmers<br/>
. The wealthy slave owner with huge plantations was in the severe minority, but they were the ruling elite. The families of the yoeman farmers were hard pressed without slaves, so often their men left after a battle, went back home to work at planting season, and went back to their companies when ever they could, especially if they were fighting near their homes. This happened regularly. It was not called desertion, though there certainly were deserters. For most it was simply a matter of fighting a hostile invader and not an issue of slavery or states rights. Most of these people were not educated, few could read and write. It was a total agragrian world, so no need to be educated, that was for rich folk primarily.</p>

<p>Conceding the point, he described a deep familiarity between generations of masters and slaves. When flood, drought, or locusts ruined the crops, a master did whatever he could to feed his slaves. One slave even emigrated to New York City and regularly sent money home to his master!</p>

I would not be so certain about that. Slavery may well exist in the not too distant future as well. One must remember that slavery was actually an improvement in the human condition because it gave value to human life that heretofore had no value. The source of slaves was primarily war captives, the same captives that previously would have simply been massacred by the victors. Slavery, in this sense, saved a good many people from oblivion. I can well imagine a similar circumstance leading to slavery again. The question that remains is &hellip;&hellip; who will be the slaves next time?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-415690" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for this review. I won&rsquo;t buy the book but might check it out of the local liberal library (aren&rsquo;t they all?). I didn&rsquo;t think I could be surprised about much of anything, but this is a little bit of a surprise. Though, surely it was only a matter of time before someone came out with this unlikely scenario. But, how clever to use the women this way. Ha, if it had been up to the women of the South we would still be at war with the YANKEES. The men/soldiers were ready to surrender, they were wounded,hungry, needed clothing and suffering from starvation. Before and during the war there was opposition to slavery and to secession (General Lee certainly opposed sucession, and he was oppressed by the burden, the worries and concerns over his slaves as was Thomas Jefferson eariler with regard to his own slaves&hellip;the slavery institution was not embraced by every slave holder, and many simply did not know what to do about it. There were no answers!! Like having a tiger by the tail! A very complex situation.)by many Southerners, poor and rich alike. But to suggest that Southern Women and slaves worked to undermine the CSA is astounding. Many of the slaves ran FROM the Union Soldiers, not to them. I guess one would have to be born in Belfast (as was the author of this book) to have the necessary schizophrenic DNA components within one&rsquo;s brain/mind to come up with this notion&hellip; and yes! Mr.Martin, I agree with you, certainly well versed in the far left ideologies including Critical Theory!! This is great, Thanks, I will print out your review to go with this book I (repeat) shall check out but will not buy!.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-416354" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good points. I think her Northern Ireland origins have something to do with her bloody-mindedness, the ferocity she expresses about executing Confederate leaders for treason. Some of my fellow Southerners will disagree, but the South was in fact treated less harshly than the Irish or the Scots, whenever one of their revolts was crushed. McCurry&rsquo;s failure to understand the difference between the American civil war and the various Scottish &amp; Irish revolts against the English, reveals a lack of historical understanding. As I&rsquo;ve said before, she&rsquo;s more interested in finding real world examples on which to impose a theoretical template than she is in uncovering and interpreting the nuances and ambiguities of history.</p>

<p>One aspect of civil war history represented by this book which I didn&rsquo;t mention in the review is the influx into the field by women. Most of what they write is in the same general vein as McCurry (though not as extreme), showing little interest in the battles &amp; campaigns, and concerned more with &#8220;gender&#8221; or race relations. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-417408" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>THE TRAGIC ERA, by Claude G. Bowers, 1929 is one of my favorite history books regarding the Reconstruction Era. As a historian, most likely you have heard of or read him. Of this book he says, &#8220;That the Southern people literally were put to the torture is vaguely understood&hellip;historians have shrunk from showing us the torture chambers&hellip;I challenged the predjudiced interpretation of sixty years&hellip;&#8221;. *Sixty years* in 1929! These kinds of books are purged from libraries and the text has been out of print for ages. I happened upon this book in a library, long forgotten, in a very small town in Alabama. How thrilled I am when I find such gems. Even better, he was a yankee. Thing is, I went to the link you provided and listened and watched her in the 1st (of 11?) video, and I have to say that I don&rsquo;t recall her saying anything that I would actually disagree with, and have a feeling she can hold her own quite well in debate, though certainly not against a military historian, though that would not be a valid debate since you say she argues the CSA&rsquo;s defeat based upon what is clearly something other than military action. History is another one of those traditionally male dominated theaters women have had a hard time breaking into (certainly since the 60s and 70&rsquo;s through Federal mandates they seem to show an eagerness to take revenge that even I can&rsquo;t deny). While I wish them success I hate to see them or anyone make gains via the technique of critial theory. Perhaps, men should offer more support to women in this field who are saying the right things. (How do *I* know I am *right*? I just do!). Then again, it is now nearly impossible for men to get print for saying the right things, or certainly saying anything other than the social revolutionary multi-culturalist party line. She may have been born in Belfast, but she sounds altogether *American*, must have been educated in the public school system in this country which would explain her knowledge base, or lack of it&hellip;she might not be able to find Belfast on a map. I look forward to your next article&hellip;Sheila Hamrick, UAB/facebook</p>

It was given to me as *gift* (no doubt to upset me,ha!), so I read it with a view that the writer may be glorifying acts of terrorism by mentally ill abolitionists, thus rubber stamping terrorism today in its present form, and possible saying dang the Weatherman were right ! Then again, one can read it with an eye to what happens to people who are isolated and get carried away with ideology, become really crazy and all this told through the lens of the *unreliable narrator.* At any rate, perhaps people in general tend to formulate their personal ideas based upon fictional creations over formal history texts? As Ayn Rand illustrated her philosophy of objectivism through her fictional works (Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead). At any rate, Banks&rsquo; Cloud splitter made me hate John Brown more than ever in the role of hero/martyr, and caused me to have the first truly negative thoughts regarding Fredrick Douglas!!! Cloudsplitter also caused me to have suspicion about the agenda of Russell Banks. Tricks everywhere!</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-415721" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The whites *were* literally displaced after the War. Some areas had a population rate of 4 blacks to every single white. The White Man died. The War left a generation of old maids, as William Faulkner put it. Many times former slaves listed in census records as *black male head of household* took into their homes white women and children in order that they might survive. The first census records for Alabama after the War illustrates this point. The Northern Republican Congress instigated much torment of the white Confederates by urging former slaves to uprise and kill all or what was left of the white race of Southerners. It did not happen because these slaves and masters did not have the kind of relationships imagined by people like Thad Stephens/stevens and other leaders of the RR in the North. After all there were millions of slaves in a not so very populated South.</p>

Secession if you do the research was legal and was taught to be so before Lincoln took over. The eleven states legislatures convened and decided that it was in their best interest to PEACEFULLY separate from a sectional government that was proving itself to becoming more and more hostile to the South. The only reason Lincoln wanted to preserve the Union was so that he could continue to economically exploit the South so that he could fund his canals and railroads etc.. What the North did to the South was nothing but criminal-Lincoln was a criminal as were his generals that carried out his instructions. The Union army laid waste to the South in every way imaginable  &mdash;  Sherman had a wagon train loaded with stolen loot that stretched for FIVE miles and the other officers did the same. Reconstruction was about ten years of the same-to this day the Grant administration is considered the most corrupt in American history-and that&rsquo;s saying a mouthful. I have studied the Civil War for over 40 years-top to bottom- left to right-and everything in between. There is so much propaganda out there to try to support what the North did but it all falls flat when you look at all the facts-that war was nothing but a criminal enterprise from start to finish. Northern financiers and the banks of Europe dreamed up that war and financed it and the heirs of that evil cabal are still running the country and they are still criminals.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-416379" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You refer to General Patrick Cleburne&rsquo;s proposal to the senior leadership of the Army of Tennessee, in December of 1863. (The text of his proposal is online.) McCurry does address this subject in her book. It brings up the question: would white Southerners have been willing to free the slaves in order to secure independence for the Confederacy? Some whites definitely were willing, though others (especially large slaveholders) were opposed. Robert E. Lee and many of the officers of his army were willing to fight alongside &#8220;slave-soldiers&#8221; by January or February of 1865, but by then it was too late.<br/>
Although it&rsquo;s still controversial, I doubt the majority of whites would have been willing to free slaves to fight, because in Anglo-American law and tradition, soldiers are seen as members of the body politic and entitled to citizenship rights, and political (not social) equality. And the Confederacy was (IMHO) based, politically, socially, and economically, on slavery.<br/>
But we will never know for sure.</p>

That really is beyond conservative&hellip;it must have been a wonderful experience! My ancestors came with land patents from the King, initally. I would have no problem being a Tory, especially on Wednesdays. Now, this dates me; My first college course about anything formally *southern* was called Southern Women, Myth and Reality. My prof was a Phd student under Bell Wiley (she worshipped him so plenty of required reading there, which I really enjoyed), and thought the Southern Woman of that period was the be all end all, so my experience was a good one. But I do not recall any negative comments about the CSA. I am not surprised that you think Women in the field of this area of history appear to be more intrested in *relationships* and not so much on military history. I would be surprised if it were otherwise. As I look back this might have been an introduction to the Women&rsquo;s Studies movement, though it was not openly named as such at that point in time. It seems odd to me how hostile African American and Women&rsquo;s Studies became in such a short time. The covert takeover was quick enough, but the hostile in you face stance a little un-nerving to me. Now the university has none other than CRT big shot Richard Delgado heading up their law school here! The thing about my history profs is this, one knew how to write a paper. Such sticklers for the tiniest detail!, I really respected that. btw I watched a movie based upon the play of Tennesee Williams last night&hellip;BABY DOLL&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to upset you but you really must see it if you haven&rsquo;t,&hellip; i read the play long ago, but this depiction of the south, the white man, and his women and the outsider is really simply tooo much&hellip;(I would love to use it as an element of propaganda in a history course about the south and post-reconstruction propaganda. ) and the portrayal of the blacks of this era (late 1920s early 1930s)hanging about on the old plantation is downright funny (in one way) because, well, you will see it right off!</p>

Feminists simply cannot stand the fact that the women of the past were meek, servile, and totally under the control of the society that existed in the mid-19th century - especially in the Civil War South. As for the negroes of that era we are talking here of largely racially-pure Africans, who were lacking the infusion of white genetics that were later to come about. Thus, with average IQ&rsquo;s hovering around the low to mid-70&rsquo;s there is simply little to no likelihood that large-scale slave insurrections could have succeeded, much less taken place.</p>
<p>In short, just another liberal fool churned out by the Cultural Marxist machine.</p>

They had trusted black slaves as *bosses* over the field hands, so the women acted as CEOs of the large plantations. The planter class could have as little as 10 or 15 slaves while the larger ones (the elite) might have a thousand or two thousand slaves. &#8220;Slaves kept the economy running&#8221; because the economice system was based totally on slave labor. That is true. The slaves did not revolt.
