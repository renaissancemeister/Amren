The campaign against free speech on campus.</div> 
</div> 



<p align="center"><b>Greg Lukianoff, <i>Unlearning Liberty: Campus Censorship and the End of American Debate</i>, Encounter Books, </b><b>2013, </b><b>294</b><b> pp.</b><b>, $25.99.</b></p>
<p>In 1998, Prof. Alan Charles Kors and lawyer Harvey A. Silvergate published an expos√© of violations of free speech on college campuses. <i>The Shadow University </i>was a best seller, and readers responded with so many horror stories and pleas for help that the authors established the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) in order to protect free speech.</p>
<p>In 2001, Greg Lukianoff was appointed the organization&rsquo;s director of legal and public advocacy, and he became the president in 2006. <i>Unlearning Liberty</i> is his account of 11 years with FIRE, during which he reviewed thousands of cases of campus censorship and represented hundreds of students and faculty.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UnlearningLiberty.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107578" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UnlearningLiberty.jpg" alt="UnlearningLiberty" width="375" height="550" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UnlearningLiberty.jpg 375w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UnlearningLiberty-204x300.jpg 204w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px"/></a></p>
<p><b>A uniquely Western achievement</b></p>
<p>Mr. Lukianoff points out that what he calls the &ldquo;system of free speech, public disclosure, and active debate&rdquo; is not universal, but a historical achievement specific to Western civilization. It is the fruit of many centuries, and is still vulnerable. Free speech rests on two principles:</p>
<p>First, no one gets the final say; we all must accept that no argument is ever really over, as it can always be challenged if not disproved down the line. Second, no one gets special, unchallengeable claims of &ldquo;personal authority.&rdquo; No one individual is immune to the criticism of others and none can claim to be above intellectual reproach. No one is omniscient or infallible, so we are all forced to defend our arguments with logic, evidence, and persuasion.</p>
<p>Mr. Lukianoff reports that today&rsquo;s students often do not understand the importance of this system. They are more likely to think that people should be muzzled if that is what it takes for groups from different backgrounds to get along. One 2004 survey of high school students reported that they were &ldquo;far more likely than adults to think that citizens should not be allowed to express unpopular opinions, and that the government should have a role in approving newspaper stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>University speech codes have been struck down nearly every time they have been challenged in court &mdash; more than two dozen times since 1989 &mdash; and this has created a false impression that the issue has been resolved. However, new speech codes spring up faster than old ones are struck down &mdash; often on the same campuses.</p>
<p>FIRE reports that 62 percent of American institutions of higher learning have at least one policy that &ldquo;clearly and substantially&rdquo; restricts freedom of speech. In most other schools the situation is ambiguous. Only 3.7 percent clearly protect freedom of speech. Many speech codes contain vague prohibitions against &ldquo;incivility,&rdquo; &ldquo;disrespect,&rdquo; or &ldquo;offending&rdquo; or &ldquo;embarrassing&rdquo; anyone.</p>
<p>Colleges often use a very loose interpretation of the legal concept of &ldquo;harassment&rdquo; as a way to control speech. As Mr. Lukianoff points out, the Supreme Court has limited &ldquo;harassment&rdquo; to only to cases in which:</p>
<blockquote><p>unwelcome discriminatory behavior, directed at a person because of his or her race or gender, is &#8216;so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and so undermines and detracts from the victims&rsquo; educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institution&rsquo;s resources and opportunities.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Universities, however, consider trivial things to be &ldquo;harassment:&rdquo; &ldquo;stereotypic generalizations,&rdquo; &ldquo;words that interfere with another person&rsquo;s comfort,&rdquo; &ldquo;expressions deemed inappropriate,&rdquo; &ldquo;jokes that demean a victim&rsquo;s culture or history,&rdquo; &ldquo;inappropriate gender-based activities, comments or gestures,&rdquo; and &ldquo;use of generic masculine terms to refer to people of both sexes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last category means that to say, &ldquo;Every student should park his car in lot B&rdquo; could be harassment. If policies like this were enforced, nearly all students would be guilty every day. Of course, the policies are not enforced consistently, and as Mr. Lukianoff points out, the students most likely to be charged are those who criticize or joke about the administration: &ldquo;As any First Amendment lawyer knows, the first thing to go is any speech that criticizes or annoys those who decide which speech is free.&rdquo; When a member of the student government at Michigan State University sent out e-mail criticizing decisions by the administration, the school punished her, declaring that &ldquo;the University&rsquo;s e-mail services are not intended as a forum for the expression of personal opinions.&rdquo; Of course it was for expressing personal opinions; just ones that did not criticize the university.</p>
<p>St. Augustine&rsquo;s College in Raleigh, NC, was hit by a tornado in April, 2011. Two days later it announced that classes would resume the next day. Many students complained since they were still without power. When the administration announced a public meeting to discuss the matter, a senior posted a comment on the college&rsquo;s Facebook page urging students to come with &ldquo;supporting documents to back up your arguments.&rdquo; He was handed a letter barring him from his graduation ceremony because all students &ldquo;are responsible for protecting the reputation of the college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many cases of censorship are ideological. The Tufts University campus newspaper published an ad paid for by a student who thought the school&rsquo;s &ldquo;Islamic Awareness Week&rdquo; painted too rosy a picture of Islam. The ad quoted verses from the Koran such as: &ldquo;Therefore strike off their [unbelievers&rsquo;] heads and strike off every fingertip of them.&rdquo; It mentioned the punishment by death of homosexuals in some Muslim countries, and quoted an Islamic theologian&rsquo;s opinion that &ldquo;marriage is a form of slavery; the woman is the man&rsquo;s slave and her duty therefore is absolute obedience.&rdquo; Another student filed a harassment complaint, and Tufts &ldquo;made free speech history by being the first institution in the United States to find someone guilty of harassment for stating verifiable facts directed at no one in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Administrations invent rules so they can go after student groups they don&rsquo;t like. One Florida community college stopped a Christian group from screening <i>The Passion of the Christ</i> on the grounds that the film was &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; and &ldquo;R-rated.&rdquo; It soon came to light that the college had sponsored an R-rated movie just the previous year, and was hosting a production of <i>Fucking for Jesus</i><i>,</i> described as &ldquo;a piece about masturbating to an image of the Christian messiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Students and faculty can be punished merely for referring to guns or violence, on the grounds that such talk is a &ldquo;threat.&rdquo; One student who gave a class presentation on the benefits of concealed-carry laws was reported to the police by his professor.</p>
<p>One popular technique for squelching speech is to designate an area on campus as the &ldquo;free speech zone.&rdquo; Such zones are often obscure corners of the campus. At Texas Tech, which has 28,000 students, the &ldquo;free speech zone&rdquo; is a tiny gazebo. A waggish mathematician computed that if all students wanted to use the gazebo at the same time, they would have to be crushed down to the density of Uranium 238.</p>
<p>Many universities inculcate students with propaganda about race and sex during orientation. In some cases, freshmen march through something called the &ldquo;Tunnel of Oppression.&rdquo; They walk through the rooms of a house where they watch live dramatizations of such themes as: &ldquo;religious parents hate their gay children,&rdquo; &ldquo;Muslims will find no friends on a predominantly white campus,&rdquo; and &ldquo;white people believe all black women are &lsquo;welfare mommas.&rsquo; &rdquo; One witness said freshmen come out with &ldquo;hopelessness and shame&rdquo; on their faces &mdash; no doubt exactly what the Tunnel of Oppression is designed to achieve.</p>
<p>The best known student &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; of this type was the University of Delaware&rsquo;s mandatory Residence Life Program. It was called &ldquo;treatment,&rdquo; and included the following goal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each student will recognize that systematic oppression exists in our society . . . will recognize the benefits of dismantling systems of oppression . . . [and] will learn the skills necessary to become a change agent for social justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Freshmen were also asked highly personal questions, such as whether they could be friends with a homosexual, a black or a Middle Easterner, or whom they would be willing to date. The indoctrination was carried out by upperclassmen called Resident Assistants (RAs), who were put through intensive screening and training during the summer. Mr. Lukianoff writes that any qualms about the program were &ldquo;met with hostility, intimidation and outright threats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RAs also got &ldquo;confrontation training&rdquo; in case they got resistance from freshmen, but they seldom had to use it. Investigators found only one clear case of a student who had resisted the &ldquo;treatment.&rdquo; When asked about her experience of oppression, she joked that people threw rocks at her because of her taste in opera. When her RA asked her, &ldquo;When did you discover your sexual identity?&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;That is none of your damned business.&rdquo; The RA filed an &ldquo;incident report&rdquo; against her.</p>
<p>Mr. Lukianoff reports that RAs got other unusual training:</p>
<blockquote><p>If an RA heard students discussing politics or religion (and some other topics), the RA would intervene and take control. The RA would give each student the chance to state his or her opinion and then tell the students to disperse. There was to be no questioning, no back and forth, no exchange, no probing, no explanations. RAs said they had been trained to quash such discussions as being uncivil.</p></blockquote>
<p>When FIRE publicly criticized Delaware&rsquo;s Residence Life Program in the fall of 2007, the university president suspended it, but Katherine Kerr and Jim Tweedy, who designed it, still work for the university. Dr. Kerr, who is still Executive Director of Residence Life &amp; Housing, has tried to start it up again many times.</p>
<p>The American College Personnel Association (ACPA) gave the Residence Life Program an award, and has continued to hold it up as a model since it was suspended. Dr. Kerr later became president of the ACPA.</p>
<div id="attachment_107599" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/KatherineKerr.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-107599" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/KatherineKerr.jpg" alt="Katherine Kerr" width="500" height="499" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/KatherineKerr.jpg 500w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/KatherineKerr-150x150.jpg 150w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/KatherineKerr-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Katherine Kerr</p></div>
<p>A few months after the program was suspended, the ACPA held a confidential meeting that was reported by a sensible infiltrator. A former program administrator lit a large candle &ldquo;to represent the knowledge and responsibility that we have as student affairs and residence life professionals.&rdquo; Next to it she placed several smaller candles to represent the students to whom &ldquo;we pass on that light.&rdquo; Mr. Lukianoff reports what happened next:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suddenly, she blew out the large candle. She dramatically looked at the audience and said that in the fall 2007, &#8216;Our light went out,&rsquo; and it was &#8216;hate, fear, ignorance and stupidity&rsquo; that caused it to go out. &#8216;With this conference, we relight the candle . . . and hate, fear, ignorance and stupidity will not snuff it out [again].&rsquo; She relit the candle and continued in this vein, concluding, &#8216;Journey with me towards our revolution of the future.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Students accused of violating vague behavior codes are often denied due process. College judicial procedures have been around for a long time, but were mainly about cheating on exams or plagiarizing papers. They have grown steadily in power and scope, and can now punish students for things many people consider normal. And on many campuses, open procedures and clear rules are considered an obstacle to the pursuit of justice.</p>
<p>Mr. Lukianoff writes about a presentation describing Michigan State University&rsquo;s Student Accountability in Community (SAC) program at a national conference in 2002:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before the session started, the presenters placed a graph on the whiteboard. At the bottom was listed &#8216;practical jokes&rsquo; and at the top was &#8216;assault&rsquo; and &#8216;rape.&rsquo; I thought to myself, &#8216;Please tell me they aren&rsquo;t going to say that people who commit rape often start with practical jokes, so we should sentence practical jokers to &#8220;accountability training&#8221; as early as possible.&rsquo; Lo and behold, that was pretty much what they said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Examples of offences for which a student might be sentenced included &ldquo;a girl slamming a door after a fight with her boyfriend&rdquo; or &ldquo;a student being rude to a dormitory receptionist.&rdquo; As punishment, students paid $50 for four discipline sessions. They also filled out a questionnaire about their offense &mdash; often several times, until they got the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answers.</p>
<p>Students were handed a list of varieties of &ldquo;violence,&rdquo; and had to decide which they were guilty of. These included &ldquo;putting someone down,&rdquo; &ldquo;using white privilege,&rdquo; &ldquo;any action that is perceived as having [not &lsquo;that has&rsquo;] racial meaning,&rdquo; and even &ldquo;using others to relay messages.&rdquo; The student then had to acknowledge &ldquo;full responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The federal government makes things worse. In April 2011, the Department of Education&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights decreed that all colleges that receive federal money &mdash; virtually all of them &mdash; must now rule on accusations of &ldquo;harassment&rdquo; according to the &ldquo;preponderance of the evidence&rdquo; standard. This is the lowest judicial standard, equivalent to &ldquo;50 percent probability of guilt plus a feather.&rdquo; The reason for this change was that student judicial procedures covering harassment could include the serious crime of sexual assault. However, the usual principle in law is that standards of evidence must be <i>higher</i> the more serious the offence: &ldquo;clear and convincing evidence&rdquo; (75-80 percent confidence) or &ldquo;beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo; (99 percent confidence). The Obama administration is telling schools: &ldquo;since sexual assault is such a serious crime, you must be more reckless about whom you find guilty.&rdquo; And as Mr. Lukianoff points out, students can be found guilty of &ldquo;harassment&rdquo; because of trivial acts.</p>
<p>The same new DOE regulations require schools that allow appeals of convictions also to allow accusers to appeal a &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; verdict. This, of course, is double jeopardy, prohibited under the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p>Campus discipline can run parallel with court proceedings &mdash; and reach different results. In 2005, Charles Plinton, a graduate student at the University of Akron, was accused by another student of dealing drugs. The case against him was weak, and a criminal jury took only 40 minutes to find him innocent.</p>
<p>A campus judiciary proceeding, <i>after</i> the jury trial, using the &ldquo;preponderance of evidence&rdquo; standard, voted to suspend him. He could not afford a lawyer to fight the charges, and killed himself later that year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discrimination&rdquo; has been redefined to stop students from forming groups around shared beliefs. The original targets were Evangelical Christian groups, which were forced to accept non-Christian members, but this means any group is vulnerable to subversion by opponents who join because they want to harm or destroy it. Yet in June 2010, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that universities may enforce this novel concept of &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; against any student group.</p>
<p><b>More administrators</b></p>
<p>One of the consequences of intrusions into free speech has been the dramatic expansion of the administrative class:</p>
<blockquote><p>Between 1975 and 2005, the number of colleges, professors, students, and BA degrees granted all increased in the neighborhood of 50 percent. [But] during the same time period the number of administrators increased by 85 percent, and the number of administrative staffers employed by America&rsquo;s schools increased by a whopping 240 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2005, an important milestone was reached: The number of full-time administrators outstripped the number of faculty. The trend has accelerated. Many administrators have minimal qualifications and even less general culture, but have increasingly been usurping powers that belonged to the faculty.</p>
<p>Administrators are paid well, and their salaries have helped drive rises in tuition. Between 1981 and 2011, tuition at private colleges tripled (adjusting for inflation), while tuition at public universities quadrupled. In 2010, student loans overtook credit cards as the largest category of personal debt. Many economists think the half-trillion-dollar-a-year higher education industry is coming to resemble a financial bubble.</p>

<p><b>Fewer opinions</b></p>
<p>Mr. Lukianoff notes that for more than 10 years, sociologists have reported that students hesitate to express opinions. <i>Unlearning Liberty</i> suggests why. The author explains that students themselves have no idea they have the right to express unpopular views, and that in the &ldquo;overwhelming majority of cases&rdquo; other students don&rsquo;t care when speech is squelched.</p>
<p>Students have heard of free speech, but may misinterpret the concept. Students who muzzle others sometimes say they were just exercising <i>their own</i> constitutionally protected freedom of speech!</p>
<p>The disappearance of debate affects the intellectual climate. Without free speech and discussion, students have only prejudices, clung to emotionally but never examined. Few people can defend their positions, so when they are attacked, their only response is anger and hostility.</p>
<p>A student described another consequence: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as though there&rsquo;s no distinction between the person and the argument, as though to criticize an argument would be injurious to the person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Frost famously defined education as &ldquo;the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence.&rdquo; In this sense, education has virtually disappeared from American campuses.</p>
<p>American citizens &mdash; so long as they are not on college campuses &mdash; enjoy greater freedom of speech than the citizens of any other Western country, but failing to exercise this freedom is the first step toward losing it. The author quotes Judge Learned Hand:</p>
<blockquote><p>A popular belief in the importance of the values inherent in the U.S. Constitution may be more important than the Constitution itself. If citizens are promised certain rights by law but nobody knows they have them &mdash; or enough people believe they shouldn&rsquo;t have them &mdash; the law ends up mattering little.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can vouch for this one. I have a immediate family member who recently got hired as a sort of &#8220;publicity officer&#8221; by a large state university. She is dense and overbearing and believes everything she is fed by her friends in the MSM (where she worked previously, shocking I know!) I can say honestly that her mental capacity hasn&rsquo;t improved since tenth grade (still uses lots of &#8220;ahs&#8221; and &#8220;like.&#8221;) I&rsquo;m guessing one of the reasons she got hired is that she was a attractive young lady but now has the &#8220;Maddow&#8221; haircut and goes out of her way to look &#8220;frumpy&#8221;.

Why do the Feminists who are (the most?) powerful element of the Liberal coalition allow this preferential treatment for their enemies? Are the Feminists afraid of the Muslims? Is this an alliance that will last until a common enemy is destroyed? Are the Feminists just ignorant of the dangers that Islam will be to Feminism? I don&rsquo;t know!</p>

One of the &#8220;multicultural&#8221; lecturers at the London University Institute of Education explained to her supposedly captive audience that the priority was to ensure the maximum immigration from the non-white world, and to ensure the maximum suppressio of any opposition to this process, to break down English national identity and cohesion. One relcitrant teacher then innocently asked how it would help the world revolutionary process if we had too many Muslim immigrants in view if their general hostility to atheism and women&rsquo;s liberation. She explained to us that this was essential to &#8220;destroy British &#8216;racism'&#8221;, but when that was achieved, we would later have to deal with Asian &#8216;sexism&rsquo;. It hasn&rsquo;t worked out quite as neatly as this communist harridan from South Africa expected, but it is clear that the white leftists see Muslims as &#8220;underdogs&#8221; and their enemy&rsquo;s enemy. &#8220;A common hate extinguishes mutual contempt&#8221; (Spengler).</p>

<p>But the general problem arose with the &#8220;non-Soviet&#8221; left guided by Herbert Marcuse &amp; comrades, using &#8220;women, blacks, immigrants, sexual minorities and students&#8221;, quite explicitly, as the white working class breadwinners, especially in the USA, were not interested in communist revolution. The way that their aims locked into &#8220;liberalism&#8221;, and the complacency or stupidity of the non-socialists (in the UK above all, for the French and Americans have had a well-informed conservative &#8220;intelligentsia&#8221;), are a long story, better told by others. </p>

The more powerful feminists are teaching them this because it fits in with the liberal agenda: every other group banding together against white, straight, Christian males.</p>

<p>And in 1984, the PC party powers that be were implementing a new language &#8220;Newspeak&#8221; that would make politically incorrect speech impossible, people were trained to hold two completely contradictory thoughts at the same time, just by force and terror they would agree.</p>
<p>So here we have Leftist feminists administrators forcing regular students to accept fundamentalist extreme Islam as compatible with feminism, extreme gay rights. It takes the Muslim immigrants a little bit to figure out how this is possible, then they learn that it&rsquo;s all about power, bashing straight White males.</p>

Ironically, it was the Church championing reason in this case, as She usually does; &#8220;Post proof or retract,&#8221; as we would say nowadays.

<p>In actuality, if Wallace was a tortured figure, no one in the day knew it. Darwin was from a wealthy family and Wallace was not. But Darwin actually helped Wallace financially. Wallace became a widely known and very popular figure whose books sold well At least one them was still in the San Jose State University library in the 1970s.

Almost any example of real discrimination already has laws on the books forbidding it, and thus any gripe is about enforcement - not that our society systemically discriminates.</p>
<p>So what is all this politically correct stuff like speech codes on college campuses about? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the non-white left and their white liberal dupes taking power for themselves. Regulating speech is one of the ways the far left discriminates, and regular middle class white people are their #1 targets. We are to be dispossessed and replaced and they are hellbent on coming up with &#8220;legal&#8221; forms of discrimination in order to make it happen.</p>

<p>Did you watch the presidential debate? Nobody cares about facts and logic, they don&rsquo;t matter. Demeanor, attitude and social skills matter.

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the premise of the US is a bad one, but obviously in the context of the modern world - encroaching globalism, ethnic immigrants, modern popular culture, etc - I honestly think a more authoritarian system would serve the white race better. The white race will obviously thrive regardless of the system, whether it&rsquo;s abysmal like feudalism or more &#8216;progressive&rsquo; like the early US.</p>

Members of that organization had hoped that President Eisenhower with Republican control of both houses of Congress would repeal the reforms of the New Deal. </p>
<p>Eisenhower did not do so because he knew that those reforms had broad, popular support. When the leaders of the John Birch Society came reluctantly to agree with Eisenhower about the popularity of the reforms of the New Deal, they composed the misconception that &#8220;The United States is a republic, not a democracy,&#8221; in order to claim that the will of the majority was morally and legally insignificant.</p>
<p>A republic is a government in which the heads of state are not hereditary. At one time this an important distinction. In an age when a number of democratic governments have figure head monarchs, it is not. </p>
<p>A representative democracy is one where the voters elect their rulers. </p>
<p>There is no contradiction. </p>

That&rsquo;s why senators were originally selected by state legislators and why we have the bizarre electoral college. (It was originally intended that the electors would make real decisions, not just blindly follow a party rule based on the popular vote.)</p>
<p>The Constitution is not nearly as ambiguous as advocates of big government pretend it to be. But the plain meaning goes against what the statists want, so statists always find some loophole in their &#8220;living constitution&#8221;. Consider, for example, the first sentence of Article I, section 10,. It begins with, &#8220;No State shall&hellip;&#8221; and then lists a number of things states are not allowed to do. Among the forbidden actions is: &#8220;make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts&#8221;. Clearly and unambiguously states are required to use gold and silver coin as their money, for anything owed to or by the state. But every state today accepts federal reserve notes as payment for taxes, and in turn pays its debts to its creditors in those same federal reserve notes. This is a part of the Constitution that is simply ignored, it is not a matter of there being sensible alternative interpretations of the relevant clause.</p>
<p>My point is not whether we should go back to a gold or silver standard. My point is that for states the Constitution <i>requires</i> they use a gold or silver standard, and if that&rsquo;s now a poor or irrelevant system of money the Constitution should have been amended appropriately. But it wasn&rsquo;t. The problem is that when you just ignore parts of the Constitution that you find inconvenient, you have no grounds to complain when parts of the Constitution you like, such as the 1st, 4th, and 5th Amendments, are violated. Starting with the War on Drugs but getting much worse with the War on Terror, the Bill of Rights is now under steady attack.</p>

Of course the stuff is always paid for by a combination of explicitly higher taxes or the implicit tax of inflation. Government schools encourage children to see the government as the benign provider of social justice and free stuff. So we get lots of Obama supporters among the college crowd. None of this is sustainable, so this just shows that democracy is inherently unstable.</p>
<p>I would prefer a government limited to its Constitution and the powers explicitly granted to it in that Constitution. That would at least force the social engineering to be done at the state level. Since states can&rsquo;t print their own money they are forced to face the consequences of foolish policies much sooner than the federal government.</p>

However, some of the JBS contributors made a much more substantial contribution. It is very naive to take &#8220;democracy&#8221; as its face value - read the political scientists like De Jouvenel or Michels, or the recent less well-known modern writers - right, left and centre - who have exposed the degeneration of the political system into a racket based on entertainment, advertising, financial corruption and election fraud.</p>

<p>Nice try. So let&rsquo;s move along to your topic.</p>
<p>The leaders and key players in Socialist/Communist/Progressive/Marxist movements have always been elites and were usually well educated people who have known how to indoctrinate and lead their useful idiots. You mentioned poorly educated but my topic was low IQ.</p>
<p>Most notable communist leaders were wealthy elites:<br/>
Vladimir Lenin: wealthy, lawyer, part Jewish.<br/>
Karl Marx: Wealthy, Univ of Bonn, Univ. of Berlin, Jewish<br/>
Leon Trotsky: born Leontyevich Bronshtein to wealthy Jewish farmers, University of Odessa.<br/>
Fidel Castro: Son of a wealthy farmer, Roman Catholic, Boarding school, prep school, U of Havana, lawyer.</p>

In the meantime they are importing and will soon legalize low IQ immigrants who are groomed as victims, listen to the propaganda, take the entitlements and vote lockstep for Democrats.</p>

I then went on to say that in school and colleges today, expressing a different opinion from the liberal playbook often means, (at best) terrible harassment, horrible name calling and being ostracized, to severe punishment and expulsion. I told her I had real fears and concerns of the direction this country is headed, and she couldn&rsquo;t really make an argument or dispute me.</p>

She had a wonderful U.S. history teacher last year, and thankfully has her again this semester for a different class, and she often slams liberalism and political correctness and judging from other comments she has made, I believe she is a closet race realist.</p>
<p>My daughter also had an English teacher who was great as well. He often brought up controversial topics for the class to debate, encouraged them to think for themselves, and NEVER gave his own personal opinion or try to influence them in any way, although he would play devils advocate once in a while. That&rsquo;s a good teacher in my opinion.</p>

When I was in junior high his, he and man were all properly used to mean either a male individual or people in general, depending on context. Now we are supposed to use the cumbersome his/her or some other contrivance. Sometimes articles are written using either her to refer to both sexes, which can cause misunderstandings to those of us taught standard American English or they alternate between his and her, which may be worse.</p>
<p>I also miss the use of words like actor/actress, aviator/aviatrix, and other sex-specific nouns. Language has been so dumbed down. And to further complain I hate that gender is now used in place of sex. We were taught that sex meant &#8220;male or female&#8221; and that gender meant &#8220;masculine or feminine&#8221;, such as boats and ships are referred to in the feminine (she) and not because they are female. This just burns me up.</p>

<p>I try to refrain from using &#8220;gender&#8221; where &#8220;sex&#8221; would be a more accurate descriptor. The turn towards &#8220;gender&#8221; is an attempt to divorce women and men from their biological sex so as to usher in the era of &#8220;transgender rights,&#8221; like unisex bathrooms.

To the best of my knowledge, the white high schools in my area-near western Chicago suburbs-still do a pretty good job. Most of those students would almost certainly benefit from a good general higher education. The young people that I know of in higher education at present seem to be doing so. To the extent that they&rsquo;re being fed PC dogma, a disservice is being done them, and we need to do something about it.</p>

Unfortuantely it turned out that my profession is one that is really hated by the US Government and is slated for elimination. I&rsquo;m a scientist/ engineer and my degree was in Chemical Engineering.</p>
<p>This is one area where the US must absolutely import Iranian / Indian/ Chinese Engineers, even for critical defense work, because US scientists are just no good. </p>
<p>Also maybe the ability to investigate things is what led me to AmRen as well as my learning about racial identities. That started about 2 years ago.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-428043" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Maybe there is a reason administrators have increased at a greater rate than faculty. In many instances administrators have been the ones to keep tuition rates down, e.g. by hiring part time teachers at $1200 per class while tenured professors are making $180,000 year for doing squat. It takes a lot of admin time to process and hire these part times but it sure keeps tuition rates down. Obviously the profs are outraged at their little scam coming to an end. So do not get too upset until both sides of the story are heard on this particular point.</p>
