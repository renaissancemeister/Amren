Firsthand accounts give up-close views of racial diversity.</div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Face to Face with Race</em>, edited by Jared Taylor, New Century Books, 2014, 211 pp., $19.95 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Face-Race-Jared-Taylor/dp/0983891028/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416336872&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=face+to+face+with+race">soft cover</a>), $4.95 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Face-Race-Jared-Taylor-ebook/dp/B00OQM9ZHM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=8-1&amp;qid=1416336872">Kindle</a>).</strong></p>
<p><em>Face to Face with Race</em> brings the reader face to face with the realities that justify race realism. These realities are conveyed in 14 essays about personal experiences that originally appeared in American Renaissance, either in the print version or on the website. The message of each of these essays is that racial differences are real and innate, and mean that the presence of blacks in this country is a perpetual burden.</p>
<p>In his introduction to this collection, Jared Taylor writes that he likes statistics more than anecdotes but that sometimes anecdotes offer insights that statistics cannot:</p>
<blockquote><p>Statistics are not reality; they are only a way to try to interpret reality. It is useful to know that the average black IQ is one standard deviation lower than the average white IQ, but what does that mean?</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the essays suggest answers to that question. In Christopher Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;A White Teacher Speaks Out,&rdquo; he includes a poignant quotation from a black student who is struggling with an assignment: &ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t do dis Mr. Jackson. I black.&rdquo; When Mr. Jackson asked his students what would happen to them if whites suddenly disappeared, one answered candidly, &ldquo;We screwed.&rdquo; The others laughed in agreement.</p>
<p>African blacks reportedly have the same view. In an article called &ldquo;South Africa under Black Rule,&rdquo; Gedaliah Braun wrote, &#8220;Ask any African why blacks can&rsquo;t, for example, make airplanes or computers and he&rsquo;ll look at you as if you were foolish for asking, since the answer is obvious: &#8216;The white man has the brains for it, and we don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; &#8221;</p>
<p>Black incompetence sometimes appears in places where one might not expect it. Black athletic prominence, as well as high black rates of violent crime, might suggest that blacks would be good combat soldiers. This does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Diversity in the Army,&rdquo; retired Army officer Duncan Hengest writes that &ldquo;in Iraq, I was repeatedly astonished by the inability of many senior black officers to think through problems.&rdquo; One of the examples he gives is a suggestion by a black officer in Iraq to put &ldquo;snipers in trees.&rdquo; That officer apparently had not noticed that there not many trees in Iraq, and that the few one finds there are mostly palm trees-which are of no use to snipers.</p>
<p>Another problem in the Army is that blacks usually require remedial training. Weapons are more complex than in the past, and it takes intelligence to learn how to use them.</p>
<p>Some blacks are unwilling to fight. Mr. Hengest writes that &ldquo;one cannot read about the Korean War without running into tales of black units that were unable to hold together under fire.&rdquo; He adds that &ldquo;the all-black 24<sup>th</sup> Infantry was notorious for hasty retreats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, black soldiers are more likely than whites to commit serious crimes. &ldquo;As a peacetime platoon leader, I was always being roped into rape investigations,&rdquo; writes Mr. Hengest. &ldquo;Invariably the suspects were black. Whites would get drunk and rowdy, but I never knew one to be a rapist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an article called &ldquo;Fighting &lsquo;Discrimination&rsquo; Rather Than Fires,&rdquo; Ray Batz writes that firefighting requires more intelligence than most blacks have, and more strength than most women have. Political pressure to increase the numbers of blacks and women in departments has resulted in drastically lowered hiring standards. Mr. Batz notes that &ldquo;some women are simply too weak to raise even the 24 foot ladder, one of the lightest in use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Batz claims that &ldquo;it is impossible to know&rdquo; how much the quality of firefighting has declined since departments have been forced to hire blacks and women, but concludes that &ldquo;quota hiring has undoubtedly meant that people have died who did not have to die. Buildings burned that did not have to burn.&rdquo; This is probably true, but it would be interesting to know if there are any studies that throw light on this.</p>
<p>Many people have a strong desire to believe that blacks are equal to whites in every way, and that race preferences are a legitimate way to make up for past discrimination. It is therefore useful to read about the actual consequences of preference policies.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Blacks and High Steel,&rdquo; Tom Dilberger writes that when apprenticeships in steel frame construction for skyscrapers were opened to blacks, &ldquo;they all failed.&rdquo; This was unacceptable, so a judge who knew nothing about steel framing ruled that the standards had to be changed so blacks could succeed in the apprentice program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When black men started filtering on to the job,&rdquo; writes Mr. Dilberger, &ldquo;it was clear from the beginning that they had no ability to do the work.&rdquo; He continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before long, it became impossible to fire any but the very worst. Courts mandated that a certain percentage of the workforce, especially on government jobs, be made up of black men.</p></blockquote>
<p>Denis Ruiz writes about the changes in Fairview Village, New Jersey, where he grew up. What was a pleasant white community changed drastically after blacks moved in and is now, in Mr. Ruiz&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;a wasteland.&rdquo; His mother has been unable to move away: &ldquo;Recently, a black teenager knocked my mother to the ground, injuring her, and took her purse. That sort of thing was unheard of in the old neighborhood, but it is common now.&rdquo; This is an example of the terrible reality many people encounter when they come face to face with race.</p>
<p>There are two articles in this anthology about what life is like for white prisoners. There are many fascinating details about the enforced racial intimacy that prison means for whites, but a number of observations stand out. One is that blacks are so loud that most whites-and even a few blacks-wear ear plugs 24 hours a day. Another is that black prisoners masturbate publicly whenever they see a female prison guard. At least in the Texas prison system, this has been so common that prison trousers are made without flies.</p>
<p>Prison is a place where illusions cannot last. Fantasies are stripped away when people of different races are forced together, and these articles describe the resulting racial conflicts in blunt terms. It is no surprise that virtually all inmates of all races would like to be segregated, but out-of-touch judges have ruled against this obvious solution to prison conflict.</p>
<p>My chief regret about this collection is that it does not include anything by Mary Morrison. She is a public school teacher in the Los Angeles area who has written <a href="../../../author/marymorrison.html">several articles</a> for American Renaissance about such things as the race gap in achievement, the yearly and futile efforts to close that gap, and how teachers, rather than racial reality, are always blamed for the gap. Her articles could have provided a worthy addition to this book.</p>
<p>I also wish that some of the essays were not limited to personal experiences-fascinating though these are-but included more general observations. For example, Gedaliah Braun, who has lived for many years in South Africa, writes that &ldquo;probably the most significant direct effect of black rule has been the dramatic rise in crime, primarily black-on-white crime.&rdquo; There must be statistics on how such things as murder rates, median income, and per capita GDP have changed since blacks started running the country.</p>
<p>I understand that the purpose of this collection was to let people speak from experience rather than present research results, but I think the book would have been stronger if it had not been quite so subjective. Even so, the cumulative impact of these articles-all of which have the ring of authenticity-is a forceful demonstration of the folly of pretending that race is anything but a terrible fault line in American society.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-660340" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Exactly. This is the book for all White fence sitters. For many of us, it will be a long overdue journey into all too familiar territory. Territory we would have been able to avoid if racial integration had not been forced on our land. We Whites need to quit thinking of Negro ineptitude and sociopathy as The White Man&rsquo;s Burden. The failures of Blacks are 99% attributable to Blacks. Failure to engage proper aforethought, exercise impulse control, and adopt and learn the key psychological attributes of European society. Self Control and Self Discipline. White culture rests on a moral code. Refraining from acting on our impulses. Doing something because it is right and good just. Not because we feel like it. The Negro race has had more than ample opportunity to learn all of this, but, with the exception of a very small number of Blacks, has brazenly refused to do so. Their wholesale disdain for the moral foundations of our culture is more evident now than ever. Negroes holding thugs such as Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin up as heroes and martyrs, instead of as violent sociopaths, shows what lies within the hearts and minds of most Negroes. </p>

Personal anecdotes from everyday workers about the stress and suffering they endure due to Negro behavioral patterns are far more effective tools for our cause than mere stats. These personal anecdotes touch the emotions. I&rsquo;ve been in the trenches myself dealing with Negroes as a tall, blue eyed Teuton. Blacks are extremely racist. Most of the time, a non-Negro is never going to win with them for this very reason. Negroes have the very &#8220;us versus them&#8221; mentality that Bill Clinton naively strove to excise from the American psyche. Negroes have not evolved or progressed whatsoever in learning to accept those unlike them, while Whites have been forced to abide by the rules of this diversity dictatorship, or lose our livelihoods. Blacks customarily refer to us as &#8220;Caucasians&#8221; in the workplace, yet we are not afforded equal freedom of speech to refer to them as &#8220;Negroes&#8221;. This excellent book is opening the bedroom door a mere crack on a subject where the door needs to be flung wide open by Whites. Our forebears built the greatest country on earth. Now, we are forced to stand muzzled by the politically correct thought Police while Negroes tear down what our forebears died to build!!! It is time to throw the door wide open, and continue what this book has started, telling the unabashed truth about Negroes. Thank you, John Engelman, for putting your name and reputation on the line for your race. The White Race. I look forward to reading this book, and to a continuing series of such books. </p>

<p>The Atlanta school cheating scandal had school administrators supplying the answers to tests to the predominately black school kids because they knew the students were incapable of doing well on the test. Some of those officials lost their jobs, which is all to the good, but only after the scandal was revealed. </p>
<p>Before that, they didn&rsquo;t treat their students as individuals who might pass or fail on their own merit. They treated them all as a group that cannot measure up and so needs unethical help. </p>
<p>The existing preferred solution to black academic failure continues to be curriculum reform, better teachers, better teacher training, more computers, nice buildings, smaller class size, and being tucked in at night. No WAY will there be an honest recognition that blacks are either fatally unmotivated or simply less intelligent than their Asian and white competitors.</p>

<p>That sounds like the conservative dogma that tax cuts pay for themselves. </p>
<p>When it comes to tax cuts conservatives have adopted the hippy slogan of the late 1960&rsquo;s: &#8220;If it feels good, do it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Conservatives also believe that less government means more economic growth, despite the fact that during the twentieth century the economy nearly always grew more under Democratic presidents.</p>

I have friends from Sweden and Canada which are quasi-socialist and have high taxes. They have told me that high taxes create underground economies and black markets, it&rsquo;s that simple. Just like that black guy in NYC, Eric Garner, was selling black market cigarettes because in NYC they are $12+ per pack. That cost is related to taxes because in W.Virginia where taxes are lower a pack is about $4.84</p>
<p>We have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. All that does is chase corporations overseas.</p>
<p>Liberals punish success to fund rewarding failures. </p>
<p>Tax cuts work because they free up money for capital investments. They attract and encourage businesses. That is why NY State is creating tax-free zones for businesses . They have seen the errors or of their ways, That is why Texas has astronomical economic business growth, because they are tax friendly.Tax cuts must be done slowly and in conjunction with spending cuts.</p>
<p>I worked in government for thirty 30-years and can attest to the culture of waste, fraud, abuse, corruption and incompetence that government workers have when they are spending other peoples money and have easy access to an endless stream of revenue. They never have to turn a profit or answer for their failures and mistakes.</p>
<p>High taxes ruin businesses and markets while low taxes encourage them.</p>
<p>Citizens and businesses have a silent partner (the government) who dictates what percentage of the profits they will take from wages and profits. I believe that is known as tyranny.</p>

<p>We went /back/ to Iraq because we sincerely believed, after the botched CIA revolution in place in 2003-04, that we would be received with &#8216;open arms&rsquo; (small arms maybe&hellip;).

<div id="dsq-comment-message-666380" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Mr. Engelman,</p>
<p>The way to win the Vietnam war was to make it clear that if the North did not mind their own business, we would end their civilization.</p>
<p>That would have been simple, even in 1965, with just the a few B-52 bomber raids &#8216;along the axis of the bridge&rsquo; (into China, where the VPAF MiGs were based) and by mining the harbor of Haiphong (of Vietnams 114 small harbors, only three have DWT/TEU limits of 50,000 tons+. Saigon and Da Nang were in the South. Laem Chabong in Thailand is 1.2 mllion DWT).</p>
<p>This is important because, when a man like Curtis E. Lemay says: &#8220;Or we&rsquo;ll bomb them back into the stone age!&#8221; he is failing to acknowledge that they are, essentially, _already there_.</p>
<p>We could have further truly crippled North Vietnam by bombing the coffer damns which held back the flood waters by which her rice crops were protected. These were all collectivized under the Communist rule (which allowed more young men and women to head south to the great &#8216;Land of Dying&rsquo; that was South Vietnam) and their destruction would have ended the war in weeks.</p>
<p>Something we knew at the time.</p>
<p>I would hesitate to state that the majority of South Vietnamese wanted to live like their poor northern cousins. Certainly perhaps during Eisenhower&rsquo;s regime when the first &#8216;advisors&rsquo; went in and corruption of the minor food aid programs (hearts and rice bowls) began. Later on, when they got a taste for things like hamburger at .25 a pound and a six pack of Coca Cola they began to change their mind as the sheer /flood/ of American logistics quickly won over the majority of the Vietnamese to our system as benefits, they just didn&rsquo;t care to do any fighting at all.</p>
<p>This changed, with training, and while ARVN was never entirely reliable, their special forces and marines became quite competent.</p>
<p>Past which, you need to look at the big picture. It is likely that Nixon&rsquo;s visit to China had been planned for a long time. Because this planet has been in the grip of an Illuminati (or whatever you care to call it) conspiracy to &#8216;develop the global civilization&rsquo; to Type-1 standards for centuries.</p>
<p>However; what began in all ignorance of the sociological factors of R vs. K selection and the great genetic disparities between world populations, was, again, by the mid-1960s, starting to be fully revealed by early IQ studies which showed the exact opposite of the egalitarian view of IQ as a universal gift.</p>
<p>With that in mind, those who have nothing BUT population, when given a plowshare of economic development, will beat it into a sword and use that sword to cut your head off.</p>
<p>Which is exactly what the patient Chinese are long-term doing.</p>
<p>That is now an inevitability as the rise of the Dragon is again ensured by continental Asian oil and gas beyond the reach of Naval airpower and at extreme risk for strategic bombers to attempt to cut.</p>
<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t known in the 1960s as the TAPS (Trans Alaska Pipeline System) which is dwarfed by the Peace Pipeline, only began construction in 1974 after the embargo in the wake of the Yom Kippur war.</p>
<p>So at that time, the desire for a &#8216;reverse California&rsquo; as Vietnamese control over the South China Sea was a very valid strategic doctrine BEFORE committing to hauling China out of her 19th century &#8216;last Emperor&rsquo; level of dogmatic Communism.</p>
<p>Basically, in the 1960s you had a traditionalist white conservative economic movement pushing for U.S. Imperial Rule of the planet being hard checked by a bunch of Jewish instructed fanatic moron children who thought that the lifestyle they lived was summoned from the air rather than real, materially resourced, control over macro-economics.</p>
<p>They were wrong and in their innocent desire to prove themselves morally superior to their parental generation rather working hard to follow the pragmatic path which made that generation _great_ (in 1950, half a decade after we had lost 100 million to a vicious war, we were 27% of the global population **and rising**) they wrecked this nation as the &#8216;Cultural Revolution&rsquo; in China was never allowed to do.</p>
<p>As a result of refusing to obey Darwinian instinct to dominate or at least to shut up and let the adults do the thinking until they wisened up to the realities of this earth, Liberal flower children have poisoned the minds of their children&rsquo;s children to the point where, today, it&rsquo;s obvious that whites are on the fast road to extinction.</p>
<p>Call me unimpressed with whose who insist that Vietnam didn&rsquo;t need to be fought.</p>
<p>LBJ was a mad fool, with many of the same leadership interference tendencies in military affairs for which he was not qualified to judge as Hitler evinced in WWII.</p>
<p>Had LBJ -also- sat still, shut up, and let victory be achieved by the professionals, Vietnam would have been the first in many American highpoints of hauling the barbarian rabble out of their own tribal primitivist funk.</p>
<p>And with that impetus of necessity as the perception of U.S. asserted Imperial Power, asserted confidently, it is unlikely that China would have cooperated quite so readily with our boot so firmly planted on her maritime resource neck with places like South America and Australia, among others.</p>
<p>Which means that U.S. industry would have stayed where it was and America would remain strong and WHITE for or our own sake.</p>
<p>As I said in my other post: Beware the thickness of the links when you chain a Dragon to cook your dinner.</p>
<p>Since Iraq and Iran and AfG are merely extensions of the same power politic scenario of control over key resources and since Saudi holds both the home of Islam and a substantial (2%?) amount of U.S. debt, the way to behead Islam is not by bombing Riyadh flat but by peripheralism as the ownership of all the oil -around- Saudi, by which OPEC has real power.</p>
<p>Iraq was set up for this very reason, knowing that we were approaching an era where Post Peak conditions and increasing non-U.S. oil needs were going to drive us to dominate several sources of oil purchase and Iraq was as good as any to start with.</p>
<p>The problem is that nobody would say the simple words: &#8220;Yeah, so what?&#8221; as a function of defying moral outrage to our occupation of a &#8216;non WMD state&rsquo;. When, in fact that was never the point.</p>
<p>Knock over Iraq, lever her out of the 7th century and suddenly Islam has to explain to it&rsquo;s people why they don&rsquo;t live at the level of an Alaskan oil-inheritance. And then you do the same to Iran. As the real sponsor of global terrorism (they hold an annual conference of all the top groups). And so on.</p>
<p>Until it becomes clear that the cost for 9/11 is the end of Islam as a state religion and a primitivist means of social dominance by the savage with the savages approval.</p>
<p>Including, at the last, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>It would take a century. But it would have been a fight that we won. Because controlling Iraq isn&rsquo;t about tanks and troops so much as the distribution of food and the adoption of a biometric RFID system which controls purchase access to same, supported by a network of cameras.</p>
<p>Under military governance, you can shoot anyone who is a threat to law and order while the cost of a telephone pole with an armored lower half and a surround of barbed wire and cement on which to mount the required cameras would be that of a few thousand dollars, in bulk. There could be hundreds, all cued by gunfire detection systems, all over Iraq. Which would have ended the insurgency with high definition video captures of faces and silhouettes associated with specific people, wherever they lived.</p>
<p>Let me add that, in closing, that you seem to believe that intelligence will rule the world when the pesky vision of conservative Imperialism as &#8216;unnecessary war&rsquo; is out of the way and savages are tamed by luxury.<br/>
This despite the fact that the vast majority of the planetary population growth as increasing resource demand comes from 80 IQ groups north of the equator and 70 IQ groups south of it.</p>
<p>You have, in your pacifist ardor, no ability to see that intelligence is secured -through- strength and that said strength is an artifact of both economic and military hard power as the ability to dictate how resources are used and who gets the greatest allocation of their manufactured goods output.<br/>
All of which Whites used to control.</p>
<p>As we now see in our own land, where whites stand aghast at the primitive behaviors of low IQ, low impulse control R-Breeding immigrants, there are not any races which are really compatible with our lifestyle but us. Or they wouldn&rsquo;t need to come here to have the dream that is a lifestyle without substance in a Service Economy that cannot sustain itself, let alone military dominance of the world&rsquo;s savages.</p>
<p>&#8216;One would think&rsquo; that this observation would have dawned on the smart leftists before they made a trainwreck of our society as race&rsquo;s respect level, both globally and at home.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t have the data and won&rsquo;t take historical generalities as &#8216;none like us&rsquo; proof, then maybe liberals should have left well enough alone and let the hawkish conservatives exercise the Imperialization modal which has served even microstates like Britain, Spain and Rome so well in the past.<br/>
Now we are doomed to annihilative blend out if not genocidal murder. And we can only look at the &#8216;smart ones&rsquo; who now control the society they have &#8216;always wanted&rsquo; and wonder how we could be so stupid as to trust such ignorant fools.</p>

<p>I have a better idea. We should have minded our own business. The same kind of right wing ideologues who do not want the U.S. government to tell them what to do think that the U.S. government should tell people in other countries what to do, and that it should kill them if they refuse.</p>

Back in the early 60s, before the great sellout of our future, a two way path forked ahead of our destiny. To the right was Empire and the eventual overrun of planet earth by whites, for our own benefit. To the left stood a fork which lead to todays near certainty of white extinction as /other/ races crowd forward to do what we would not and we are driven further and further from our own homelands.<br/>
This is not good or evil, this is live or die as Darwinian selection. That others tread upon the same path, to the same choice which we abandoned is the proof of this.<br/>
Now. With the decks cleared of the Cultural Marxist BS, the reality of The Great Game which is statecraft is that it is better to defeat your enemy by taking away his friends because that way, everything you do forces him to deal with you and his troublesome allies at the same time and if it gets rough, it gets rough in his court with his buddies and so he loses strength, regardless.<br/>
I told you that the setup for China&rsquo;s becoming The New Germany (slave industrial manufacturing source) occurred long before Nixon went. And with that in mind, control over Vietnam as the South China Sea was _necessary_, not just to inhibit the expansion of Communism but to turn it inwards upon itself.<br/>
So that we might offer a better deal.<br/>
Cutting off China&rsquo;s southern coast, as Japan and Korea cut off Shanghai was the precursor to this, even when Guangzhou (Hong Kong) was still British.<br/>
Stop thinking like a modern man whose people have already lost their best chance for survival and success and start acknowledging the geostrategic conditions of the Cold War and ONLY THEN will you be in a position to bring the two positions together as what could have been. And what now is.<br/>
It is the craven inability of leftists to see what they have ruined in their quest for &#8216;strange tongues and exotic foods&rsquo; that I despise the most. The social body which doesn&rsquo;t press outwards and provide place as opportunity for it&rsquo;s youth to become powerful in their own right inevitably begins to suffer the pressure of those populations which do.<br/>
And the radical left who are really just moronic empaths without the ability to critically analyze /why/ something which is cruel might have to be, have cost their race, our nation and their children&rsquo;s future _everything_ that might once have been a great deal more lasting and genteel for our people.</p>

<p>　</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The War in Vietnam was an expensive, losing war fought with a tough resourceful enemy, in which the rewards of victory and the penalties of defeat were imperceptible.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Not because you say so. The Jungle killed more Vietnamese than we did and it did so because they could not keep themselves supplied with the most basic of medicine, food and water rations as we bombed anything which moved along the HCMT.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Choosing to bomb the wide part of the funnel rather than the narrow is a function of stupid tactics. A fact proven at the end of the campaign when Nixon said &#8220;Win. That&rsquo;s all I care about.&#8221; and six weeks later, we did. By cutting the Paul Dhomer and Dragons Jaw bridges and mining Haiphong Harbor, we put North Vietnam out of the Warfighting business.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>That could have been done in 1965 but for the screw-loose romanticism of morons like LBJ with his control fetishes and desire to prove to the world who owned the military.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Vietnam was unimportant to our economy or security.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see. Setting up China as a competitive economy without a stranglehold control over her resource delivery was stupid.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of the Vietnamese supported the Communists. We devastated that country in order to prevent a fair election from being held.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Some 800 Budhists monks torched themselves in protest of the U.S. presence, during the war. When the Communists, whom the monks had actively abetting by using their monasteries as a ratline, invaded, they took away those monasteries and some 10,000 monks immolated themselves. Nobody cared about that because the Jewish MSM only wanted to make us look bad. They didn&rsquo;t give a flip about the Vietnamese.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Or how about Hue, eh? I&rsquo;m sure those 4,062 civilians were jsut /asking/ to be clubbed to death by NVA and VC who were too cheap to use a bullet. I mean after all, teachers, administrators, educated city folk, can&rsquo;t have them messing up the Cultural Revolution, now can we?</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Nor did the media accurately report what they saw of the VC &#8216;recruitment tactics&rsquo; of butchering half the village and threatening the other half if the elders didn&rsquo;t sign on to the five year plan. Sounds like the Viet on the street was really gunho about being a Communist, don&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The United States could not have won that war without risking a much larger war with the Soviet Union, Communist China, or both. And for what?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Rubbish. Read _Fifteen Minutes_ by D.L. Keeney. If the U.S. had wanted Russia and China both dead, we had the means to make it a surprise attack with enough warheads to end them. We were the ones who were chumps for letting these fine folk base MiGs out of their territory and ship war materiel to a country attacking an ally of ours and we did nothing about it.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Had we flown over the big bridges into China, there would have been nothign they could do to stop us and that would have spelt the end of the Vietnamese ability to export their little vicious hate parade.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The 1960&rsquo;s was an iconic decade. William Wordsworth could have been writing about it when he wrote, &#8220;Bliss was it on that dawn to be alive/But to be young was very heaven&#8221;.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was the decade that a bunch of spoiled, supercilious, moron teenagers, living in the shadow of their parents actual greatness decided to get some easy social credit of their own, typically by rebelling the opposite way.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>That broken faith with their parent&rsquo;s and their nation has effectivel destroyed our people. You would NEVER see this with the Chinese, the Russians or the Jews. Because they know that, whatever the problem is, you present a united front to the world.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Your poet chap sounds like a man looking back on a time of innocence as if that is not the most destructive period in a person&rsquo;s or a group&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Those years would have been so much sweeter without that stupid, brutal war. Nothing good came from that war. When young people rejected the War in Vietnam, they often rejected much else that deserved to be respected.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Nothing good came from the arrogant, hypermoralist, response to that war by this nations&rsquo; spoiled youth as Rebels Without Cause, they had no business in it and no real reason to fear it but simply took it as a moment of weakness in which to push their own foul agendas and enjoy the excitement of being in rebellion against something that had protected them and nurtured them throughout the fifties as they soaked up the tales of their parent&rsquo;s generation and were filled with envy as the respect they had.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>&#8216;White Privilege&rsquo; can be most accurately applied _here_. James Dean you were not, but just as pointless and immature were your actions in defining the stupidity of a generation.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>In his &#8220;On the Revolu tion in France&#8221; Edmund Burke wrote, &#8220;an absurd theory on one side of a question forms no justification for alleging a false fact, or promulgating mischievous maxims, on the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Once upon a time, our youth learned from history and when they didn&rsquo;t, they at least knew better than to interfere in matters beyond their ken. The entire planet is STILL caught up in The Great Game it&rsquo;s just that whites have gone from the front of the pack to the back of the bus and it all began with a bunch of grimey drug and sex obsessed twits who thought &#8216;free love&rsquo; was the world&rsquo;s answer to their prayers not to have to do anything.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The justification for the War in Vietnam was an absurd theory that seemed to justify the rejection of everything in traditional morality. What people of your persuasion call &#8220;Cultural Marxism&#8221; would not have received its momentum without the reaction against the War in Vietnam.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>When you gaze out from your ivory tower upon the vista of blight and devastation that your kind has placed before our people, remember that the door was opened to Cultural Marxism when the schiltron of white will was abandoned by a bunch of weak minded buffoons who thought they knew it all and decided to arbitrarily ruin all their children&rsquo;s futures.</p>
<p>Your canned dogma smacks of propaganda and reminds me of Jack McCoy &#8216;playing the part&rsquo; of someone who was there. Your caricature of the 60s as something special is our pain, knowing that what made it so was the betrayal that lead to our pain.</p>
<p>Enjoy the ignominy sir. You deserve it.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-686854" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Tax cuts have nothing to do with conservatism. Kennedy cut taxes you&rsquo;ll recall and the economy grew. Yay, JFK. Reducing taxes from the ruinous heights generally beloved by leftists is a logical move explained by any economic textbook that discusses the Laffer Curve. You can look it up. </p>
<p>Until Obama and his revealing comments on the capital gains tax, the idea of fiddling with tax rates was generally to maximize tax revenue. True, progressives have also wanted taxes that were confiscatory and redistributive to carry on their class warfare so beloved of communists. Obama fits right in there. He&rsquo;s the one who had a communist mentor and who started his political career in the living room of two communist terrorists. But he&rsquo;s not a real communist. No, no, no.</p>
<p>Your &#8220;nearly always&#8221; phrase is accurate. The economy stagnated under the New Deal, and it roared to life after the war when gigantic 90% income tax rates were repealed by Ike. We had stagflation under Carter, and now anemic growth under Obama and 92,000,000 people out of the workforce. Great economy under Reagan and an ok one under Clinton but, as you know, he had his fiscal and spending policies jammed down his throat by Newt and the boys. So, you&rsquo;re down to growth under JFK and Clinton. Well, Clinton&rsquo;s policies were really conservative policies forced on him and JFK would be a hardcore conservative these days compared to lunatic leftists who run the Donk Party these days. So, actually, your point is a disproven. </p>
<p>And, yes, Nixon and Bush &rsquo;43 did much damage to the system.</p>

<p> Correct&hellip;and Liberals have not figured out that endless spending and expansion of government programs does not balance the budget. What you said is essentially meaningless. I think the Conservative viewpoint is that people would (and should) be able to keep more of what they earned if it wasn&rsquo;t squandered needlessly by social program spending which has no effect other than to exacerbate the problem. Of course a decline in revenue does not &#8216;balance the budget&rsquo;, but when that budget is a horrific instrument of plunder for special interests (most of them Liberal in nature) should we blame the people paying for it and who are objecting, or those who are spending and telling us that we are still not paying enough in taxes?</p>

<p>Watch closely John, this is a lesson in common sense and exposes your short-sighted, and/or deceptive practice of cherry-picking a statistic to support a false argument:</p>
<p>You cannot add 2.6 million jobs every year John. Eventually you run out of working people. The fact that Reagan created less jobs is directly attributed to his declining unemployment figures. Carter had more unemployed people to put to work. Reagan put them to work so the pool of unemployed shrunk. The fact that Reagan was running out of unemployed people is a good thing yet you presented it like it was a bad thing by latching onto one statistic that cannot be viewed alone.</p>

I tell them that it&rsquo;s not about politics, but about identity, and that, once identity is solved, we will continue to argue about taxes, social spending, defence and military adventurism, and they may very well win those debates, but if we don&rsquo;t come together on the identity issue, then none of it will matter because it won&rsquo;t be us in the first place.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-659523" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I meant to say this in previous discussion of this book, but haven&rsquo;t yet so I will now. And that is that the cover of the book is lacking information about what exactly is between its covers. For the sum total of text on the front is:</p>
<p>&#8220;Face to Face with Race, Edited and with an Introduction by Jared Taylor&#8221;</p>
<p>When I first saw the ad for this book on AR several months back, my reaction was to wonder what sort of a book it was. It was apparently not BY Jared Taylor. Who then was it by? Was it a collection of essays by various authors, compiled by Taylor? Apparently yes   &mdash;   but who ARE those authors; and what KIND of essays are they? </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some friendly, constructive criticism for future editions: add a little more information on the front. This will not only help the uninitiated know what to expect from its contents, but will also help make the product look more professional, since no mainstream publishing firm would put out a volume with only the minimal wording currently on this cover. Something like &#8220;A collection of personal essays on white-black relations.&#8221; Or &#8220;Real people writing about race.&#8221; Actually, the sub-head of this review by John Engelman would do quite well: &#8220;Firsthand accounts give up-close views of racial diversity.&#8221; Any of these phrases, or other wordings to the same effect, would benefit the book&rsquo;s packaging and presentation.</p>

They don&rsquo;t dominate in boxing, where Whites, Mestizos and Asians can overcome the fact that they have longer arms and thicker skulls on average, just think about Pasquaio or the Klitschko brothers recently.<br/>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-659906" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I disagree. Jon Jones is sponsored by the UFC! The FIRST TIME he fought a man who had won more than ONE fight in a row was when he squared off against Jon Gustafsson. And almost everyone who watched the fight believed Gustafsson was robbed by the judges, including most of the UFC champs who voiced their opinions on Twitter. And their rematch was scrubbed for all kinds of made up reasons and situations. </p>
<p>Several years back when the UFC was looking to secure contracts with the TV Networks, network executives told the UFC it needed to be more minority friendly. They didn&rsquo;t begin to fix fights per se. But by ignoring and not signing top white fighters, they were able to pave the way for a fraud like Jones. </p>
<p>Silva on the other hand was a great fighter. There were some people who likely could&rsquo;ve knocked his block off (which eventually happened anyway) but that guy truly was an all-time great. </p>
<p>The change in boxing has been interesting. The usual suspects tried to cover for their favorite tools, blacks, by saying less blacks were going into the sport, yet this proved not to be the case. There are more fighters, including black fighters, than ever before in the US. But the sport picked up in Europe, with Slavics dominating the heavyweight division, and Europeans from all over nabbing titles in the other weight divisions. Whites now hold 17 of 20 belts from 150 lbs on up. Most notable is that whites have changed their style(s), they no longer try to emulate black fighters, trying to win the speed or hardest head game. You can bet the usual suspects will try and do all they can to &#8220;right&#8221; this terrible wrong.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the story you mention about the TV networks can be verified, but if so, I&rsquo;d like to see the proof.</p>
<p>I will go so far as to say I think I have seen at least one UFC fight that was fixed. But that was Jon Jones against another black fighter, Rashad Evans. Look it up. It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re playing some kind of Patty Cake Fag-Dance the whole time.</p>

Most gyms were located in rough inner city Black neighborhoods. Then the Russians came to the US and practically took the sport over. Current Russian champions Kovalev, Triple G and Klitschko have astronomical KO records. I believe Kovalev leads the pack with around a 96% knockout rate. Talent like that hasn&rsquo;t been seen in boxing since the 1950s.</p>
<p>Whites excelled in MMA because so many of them were standout wrestlers who easily transitioned into the sport. Just about every high school in the USA has a wrestling program and many Whites having a natural core strength were gifted at the sport. Wrestlers can often dictate where the fight takes place and with some submission training they became the dominant athlete to beat. The MMA stars of today though are very well rounded and few people hang on to a title belt very long.</p>

<p>Blacks have a larger psoas major than whites do and larger typically means more strength. On the other hand, blacks lack the psoas minor muscle in 91% of cases according to one study, wheras whites lacked a psoas minor in only 13% of the cases in the same study. The role of the psoas minor muscle to my knowledge has not been very well defined, probably because to study it would irrevocably shine a 2 million candlepower spotlight on the reality that race is real. It probably adds some stability but if the psoas major muscle is larger in blacks then I don&rsquo;t know how to interpret which would have better core strength.<br/>

White&rsquo;s dominate strong man competitions which involve a lot of core strength. Most of the elite wrestling and submission athletes are also White. Years ago I read where White people tend to have a more robust torso than Blacks which would often translate into added power. I know when I was actively competing in grappling tournaments I often found the very muscular Blacks were generally not as strong as what they appeared to be. So my posting was just an opinion and nothing more.</p>

<p>There are a fair number of very good black MMA fighters: Jon Jones (current light heavyweight champion), Anderson Silva (former middleweight champion), Rampage Jackson (former light heavyweight champion), Mighty Mouse Johnson (current flyweight champion), and Daniel Cormier (currently 15-0 at heavyweight and light heavyweight).</p>
<p>That being said, the list of noteworthy black MMA fighters in the history of the sport wouldn&rsquo;t be a lot longer than that list of excellent black MMA fighters. Whites (particularly Americans) and Hispanics (particularly Brazilians) do and always have dominated the sport. </p>
<p>As for boxing, a very substantial percentage of the greatest boxers of all time have been black.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure if I really sat down and thought hard about it, I could think of a few other notable black fighters, but there are not really all that many who achieved world-beater status or even perennial contender status. Randleman is the only black man to ever be heavyweight champion in a major promotion, unless my memory is failing me, and Randleman was not a great champion.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-659978" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I am glad everybody that there has been a massiv reaction to my outrageous statement:</p>
<p>I first said those words 20 years ago and believed them. (i.e. In 20 years time all Sport will be dominated by Blacks). Well, it&rsquo;s been 20 years now and they still don&rsquo;t dominate sport, but&hellip;.<br/>
Is it just a matter of time?</p>
<p>My Theory was: &hellip;I believed when it came to Golf, grand prix, gymnastics and other sports<br/>
that the reason black people did not yet dominated was simply down to the racism. Only 50-60 years ago it<br/>
would not have been uncommon for a black person to not be allowed to<br/>
join a Golf club, let alone set foot on a Golf course. The same goes for<br/>
tennis courts and Snooker venues. I believed the only reason black<br/>
people didn&rsquo;t dominated these other sports was simply because they had<br/>
not been allowed to participate in them years ago when white people were<br/>
in control.</p>
<p>And money: Blacks dominate the sports that don&rsquo;t require huge amounts of money to participate in, ie all the running sports, but any sport that requires a lot of money and facilities, sailing, formula 1 racing, etc. even rowing, they didn&rsquo;t hav a chance.</p>
<p>I also looked at the case of the Williams Sisters. Two Ghetto girls who their Father forced to play tennis often using rubbish strewn beat-up municiple tennis courts in rough areas. They hav came to dominate womens&rsquo; tennis for the last 10 years or more. I don&rsquo;t like the Williams sisters for the same reasons that everybody else doesn&rsquo;t, they are so massiv and butch, they are just not attractiv, I prefer the Russian female players in that respect, but seemingly without almost trying, Blacks came to dominate female tennis, what if 1,000&rsquo;s of Blacks started to play tennis? Would they dominate tennis?</p>
<p>and Don&rsquo;t dismiss the Cuban example either: They may not win all those Gold Medals, that&rsquo;s not the point. It is that the Blacks domination in their Cuban sports teams that matters. Blacks dominate all the Cuban sports teams despite Whites being the majority, twice as many in fact and Blacks the minority. Rowing for example, both the top male and top female rowers in Cuba are both Black, very Black.</p>
<p>Winter sports: I didn&rsquo;t see any reason why the Blacks wouldn&rsquo;t dominated Winter Sports either. </p>
<p>But it hasn&rsquo;t Happened. </p>
<p>In that 20 years also something else has happened that I thought<br/>
I would NEVER see, White men hav come back from the dead and to<br/>
dominate Boxing! The Klitchko Brothers being the most famous example of<br/>
this phenomenon. Almost a totally East European phenomenon, yet still White, why? what are the conditions that hav allowed East europeans to dominate and this new White domination, is it a<br/>
permanent or a temporary? </p>
<p>Will I still be saying in 20 years time &#8220;Oh you know Blacks will dominate all sports in 20 years&rsquo; Time?&#8221;, or hav we/I missed something really important?</p>

<p>Who really cares who runs a hundred meters the fastest? In a world with automobiles and jets and orbiting craft and interplanetary craft, running fast is an obsolete skill. A quadrennial amusement at best.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write here what I wrote in an Occidental Dissent comment awhile back. While it&rsquo;s specific to a potentially independent Dixie, I think it has some applications to all white people(s):</p>
<p>Dixie will truly be ready for true nationhood when its young white men think that winning the robotics contest is more important than winning the football game.</p>

<p>Whites are superior at strength/intelligence sports/events, building societies, raising children, creating, and sustaining the negro and other weaker sub-species. </p>

<p>Our inventions and creations speak for themselves. No other race has set foot on the moon.</p>
<p>The Cultural Marxists have us believe through 24/7 media brainwashing that blacks are more desirable life partners for White women because they are falsely portrayed as intelligent, hard working, gentle, non-violent, better fathers (look how THAT turned out for Cosby) and caring while White males are portrayed as boobs, bumbling fools, unintelligent and prone to violence, especially against women and children. The exact opposite of reality.</p>
<p>Result? Miscegenation and single parenthood for White women, a terrible situation for children and the breakdown of the bedrock of White civilization: The intact nuclear family, which the Cultural Marxists tell us is aberrant and in need of total destruction because it is harmful to women and children. The exact opposite of reality.</p>
<p>But when you look at the goal of Cultural Marxism: The complete destruction of the White Race, then it all makes perfect sense.</p>

Look at how many White Women are going out with Black Men? You&rsquo;ve got the same problem as we have here in the UK. We hav so many &#8220;Mixed-Race&#8221; children they hav a separate category on forms now, but what does &#8220;mixed race&#8221; mean? it basically means White women giving birth to Black children.

It&rsquo;s obvious to even black men that White women are more attractive than black women. Why else would some rich black athlete like Michael Jordan date a White woman? I don&rsquo;t see the negro/Asian tiger Woods dating non-White gold diggers.<br/>
There are many more White &#8220;athletic hunk&#8221;(s) than there are black &#8220;athletic hunk&#8221;(s). And even more so when you include intelligence and someone you&rsquo;d want to raise your kids with.<br/>
So are you dating a negro? How is the relationship going? With all due respect you sound a bit bitter in your comments.<br/>
Perhaps you were in a rush but it would be easier to read your comments if you left spacing and used uppercase when necessary.</p>

<p>Most White men are scrawny and ugly, boney noses as in the photo up above, hav narrow shoulders, skinny short legs, don&rsquo;t muscle up well, funny shaped heads, flat backsides, some hav ginger hair, are a bit hairy, they can&rsquo;t dance or cook.</p>

Then the media began a subtle reverse psychology campaign over here, beginning around 1993. Its scared the bageezers out of whites and the media has kept up this reverse psychology campaign ever since. No one ever comes out and talks about it or really acknowledges it, though. That scares people even more. It&rsquo;s tough to keep people scared for 20 some odd years, but, considering our problems, they manage to do it easily enough..<br/>
We have the white girl/black man thing in major urban areas but most white girls seemed to have gotten the hint. Now, perhaps 10% of white girls marry their Indian, Mexican, Chinese and other affirmative action co-workers. At least 10 percent of affirmative action female office workers seem to! And that&rsquo;s an understatement from what little I&rsquo;ve seen myself. A small few seem to marry black, but they seem to have decided they don&rsquo;t want to hurt the black family, and as I said, adjusted. All of their children show up as part of our 1.8 white birth rate, I believe.<br/>
I&rsquo;ve literally seen white girls cagily try to get white boys (that they may want to date) jealous by feigning this. They are actually after a white husband. It was actually on campus that I noticed this. It may work in some cases but I fear the over all effect may not be the one they intend.</p>

Undefeated for 13 years (1987 - 2000) at the highest international level of wrestling. Within that 13 years, he went six straight years without losing a single *point*, won 3 Olympic gold medals, 9 World Championship golds, and 12 European Championship golds. So here&rsquo;s to Alexander Karelin, the scariest white man on earth.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-659617" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>By focusing on black &#8216;inability&rsquo; and not the overwhelming black racism experienced by every contributor in the book, Mr. Engelman deflates the wheel that could get this race car going. There are a few cases in these stories where black inability caused the whites in them to suffer, and it is interesting to note (and a few cases it is simply a part of the story) but what if the blacks in them had been super-proficient and the whites involved slackers?Would the racism whites suffered have been any less, or would their superiors and co-workers have tormented them all the more? The real issue here is their racism and hatred and plain &#8216;ole disregard for whites. It&rsquo;s been a long time, but Jared Taylor has previously pointed out, &#8216;with affirmative action policies, how are whites (who deserved the chance) going to pick up these skills&rsquo;? One cannot complain about affirmative action and then also claim that all blacks are useless and in a subordinate position, and incapable. </p>
<p>As far as the firefighter, soldier and policemen are concerned, if it is true, women on average have innate disadvantages in these fields (ignoring affirmative action) it must also be true blacks on average have advantages here. &#8216;Race realists&rsquo; should acknowledge this sad (if unimportant) truth.<br/>
Women can have success in all these fields (and are having success - despite their natural disadvantages, on average). What is more interesting to me is that there has been no progress in the garbage collection field. None at all. Virtually zero. I don&rsquo;t suspect this will change. I do not claim to be a race-realist myself, if only for the fact race realist phonetically sounds like racist. I stray from the heard a bit here on AmRen, too, but when everyone starts to say the same thing, that&rsquo;s when you know it&rsquo;s a lie. </p>
<p>Most jobs in America do not require much intelligence. Intelligence (or affirmative action) is only required to get them. It is the racism and disregard for Whites that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be going away.</p>

<p>Before the games we always knew that they would be fast, athletic, and strong. But when it came to discipline, tactics, team solidarity, football IQ they where often comical. </p>
<p>The moment something went wrong they would all be at each other throats. &#8220;Damn T&#8221;Rone you dumb Ni88a the count was on 3&#8243; &#8221; NA Jamal you a dumb Ni88a !&#8221; and so on and so forth. </p>
<p>Also often times once things started going poorly for them or it was clear that they could not make a comeback there star players would start doing their best to just earn personal glory just try to get as many yards, or jukes or passes whatever. Just so that at the end of the game they could say &#8220;Yah Ni88as is wack I was busting ass out there&#8221; .</p>
<p>Thats why the whole prospect of an actual race war is something I look forward to. The fact that they think they can win is a result of their low average IQ, and childish interpretation of reality.</p>

Contrast this clear writing by layman with the tortured syntax and writing from the Cultural Marxists (and supposed academics) that we are sometimes exposed to here on AmRen.</p>

I noted in my review that the book could be good for liberals sitting on the fence, since the accounts are presented without invective or rancor. But the chances that fourteen of us could write about our experiences with race and <i>not</i> veer into some decidedly uncivil language is probably nil, and no doubt Jared Taylor had to sand off many rough edges. Certainly in my own personal experience, after a lifetime of egalitarian lies, I did not greet the unpleasant truth with measured, civil tones. There&rsquo;s none of my blazing anger in this book, and that&rsquo;s probably a good thing if one&rsquo;s aim is to try to convince people who still have some liberal delusions.</p>

But I am not surprised at how incompetent and unqualified they are for their roles. They seem to act as if they know what is going on and all the requirements of their duties, but it doesn&rsquo;t translate in their overall performance. In a city where 34% of the populace is Black it is not surprising that it would have a morass of social, political, economic and infrastructural problems.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-body-660119" class="dsq-comment-body">
<div id="dsq-comment-message-660119" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This viewpoint leaves out the fluid and changing nature of populations. One example: the achievement gap between races has increased since the 1960s due to liberal policies. Blacks have been dumbed down more than whites, although all groups are being dumbed down. As well there is such huge diversity within races that it makes it hard to maintain a realistic racist viewpoint. There are so many hoardes of stupid and criminal white people that I myself would not like to associate with. I think the only way race would be important is in two cases:</p>
<p>1. Stop endemic discrimination (affirmative action etc.) and accept that some groups are more capable on average than others. I find this something worth arguing for a lot more than constantly talking about how stupid blacks are and how separation is the answer to everything. Stop discriminating against whites and let them freely associate (as in stopped force integration). I don&rsquo;t think its neccessary to go to the other extreme and force separation or to totally exclude someone based on race. I think the supposed liberal dream of people being treated equally would serve the interests of most race realists.</p>
<p>2. Any kind of ethnic community that does exist must be held together by a culture. Simply dividing people up by ancestry doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. There must be a synthesis of race (i.e. ancestry) and culture and identification with that group. The community should have standards. So the white person with an I.Q. of 80 is not considered a normal white person. If we look only at ancestry then we consider the white person with an I.Q. of 80 to be one of us and the black person with an I.Q. of 120 to be a &#8220;stupid negro&#8221;. It&rsquo;s too simplistic of a view that doesn&rsquo;t hold up. </p>
<p>The problem here is I don&rsquo;t see anyone motivated enough to create a real ethnic community, other than Jews. They already have the three aspects of ethnicity- ancestry, culture and group identification. Without that, your racialist attempts are rather futile. It&rsquo;s like capturing a band of wolves and trying to divide them up according to whether they interbred with foxes or not. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what their ancestry is- it matters what they are now. We&rsquo;re all pretty much degenerates now living in a community with no standards. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the most important change. In the 1950s if you were going to a white school and you were stupid the teacher would put a dunce cap on you and sit you in a corner. Today if you are white and go to a white school and you&rsquo;re dumb, the teacher will tell you that you are special and double the funding for your education and probably give you an affirmative action government job. The promotion of inability is more fundamentally important than race. </p>
<p>Then if you were white in the 1950s and being extremely anti-social- violent, rude, disruptive etc. you would be consider defective. Today such behavior is considered normal. I know they put all the low income kids on ridalin for acting like normal kids, I don&rsquo;t mean that, I mean people walking around grabbing their crotch and assaulting people etc. It&rsquo;s the total absence of an ethnic community with clearly defined standards and identity that is more important than ancestry. Somebody with navajo ancestry that lives in a white community is not a real navvajo. He needs to be part of an existing navajo tribe to be a navajo. Community and the standards associated with it are important.</p>

Not all lower IQ Whites are violent or useless. They can be of value in a White nation and can contribute to society. Plus, except for outright race traitors I am not willing to sacrifice any White person to the hordes. Let the high IQ black improve his race. </p>
<p>We desperately need separation from blacks. Since 1865 it has been proven time and time again that we can only live among blacks when we maintain strict control of society. Not only has that strict control disappeared it is tiring. Why not just live among a people who are generally able to follow the rules without a police state?</p>
<p>Furthermore blacks aren&rsquo;t being dumbed down, they are devolving. From personal observation the talented 10th have very few children and the ghetto blacks have many. They are devolving back to their natural state.</p>
<p>I do agree we need to get away from AA and allow more freedom of association. We must get away from the idea that we are all the same and all have the same innate abilities. We don&rsquo;t. Equal under the law, yes, equal outcomes, no.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-660228" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>So basically the root feeling here is that we are a white race and to be loyal to it. There is no logic to it, just a sense of us vs them. I don&rsquo;t really feel any connection to the people around me. I don&rsquo;t feel like they share my basic values or nature, regardless of race. I value things like community or reading books. They value things like getting laid and getting high. I plant flowers, they sniff glue. I can live among these people but I don&rsquo;t feel I am one of them. The main thing that draws me to online WN sites is the massive amount of discrimination against me for being a white male, along with speeches in school about how all problems are caused by the white man etc. I wouldn&rsquo;t even feel a strong sense of race if it wasn&rsquo;t for the odd fact that I continually deal with people who see me only as a white male and can&rsquo;t see me as an individual. </p>
<p>I would say whites are devolving as well. One thing that really struck me when reading Nietzsche and even a lot of Nazi racial theorist seem to have stated this: Man didn&rsquo;t evolve from monkeys. Monkeys de-evolved from man. Lesser evolved races aren&rsquo;t simply primitive prototypes of the more advanced ones: they are defective, degenerated versions of the more perfect beings. I&rsquo;m sure reality is more nuanced than that but something about that resonated with me. </p>
<p>There seems to be some inconsistency as to the motivations. Are they motivated by an idea that non-whites are inferior or that whites should have a loyalty to each other and sense of group identity? I guess some more fundamental questions should be clearly stated in books like this, along with an FAQ addressing common assumptions and questions. If its all about white loyalty then its a matter of personal choice (or feeling) whether someone identifies as part of the white tribe. Bell curves and statistics really wouldn&rsquo;t matter as much. Again if it was about a sense of identity then there should be some formal declaration of membership (such as with the Jewish tribe). </p>
<p>That has probably been the weirdest thing about online racist ideology that I could never understand. Some white person who doesn&rsquo;t share your views, or even consider white to be an important part of identity- you really care about who he dates or where he lives and impose your own morality onto this guy (or girl). I don&rsquo;t understand why you consider yourself to be a part of something that doesn&rsquo;t exist, or consider people on your team who themselves don&rsquo;t believe they are on your team. It&rsquo;s like believing you are married to a woman, but you aren&rsquo;t married in any official way and the woman doesn&rsquo;t consider you to be her spouse. It&rsquo;s all in the head of the racalist. That might be why endless conflict divides them. One person considers all blondes to be on his team and part of his race. He never bothered to consult any actual blondes on this issue. So he gets upset when some blond neighbor who never met him before goes and marries a brown haired person. Another person considers all &#8220;Germans&#8221; to be on his team, never consulting anyone else. etc. etc. No wonder when they come together into a group there are endless conflicts of ideology and no ability to agree or work on anything productive. There seems to be a strong thread of irrationality here. Maybe that&rsquo;s my problem, I&rsquo;m approaching this subject from a rational viewpoint.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-660311" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There is a huge amount of variation among the white race. A huge variation in appearance, intelligence, beliefs, behaviors, sanity etc. I would say that difference is to the point of being greater than the difference between some member of the opposite race. I have more in common with socially well adjusted high IQ black man than a typical meth head white prison inmate. I think too much emphasis here is placed on some sense of loyalty to &#8220;white race&#8221; when its far too general of a term and arbitrarily defined. The arbitrarily defined aspect could explain why there are so many ingroup conflicts between online WNs as to who is or isn&rsquo;t white. I don&rsquo;t consider someone to be part of my family who does not recognize me back as family or share my values and so forth. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure when David Rothschild comes up with a plan to sterilize me or strip me of my rights, he isn&rsquo;t doing it because he&rsquo;s &#8220;family&#8221;. He&rsquo;s doing it because I&rsquo;m not part of his family. It would be ridiculous for me to look at predators who prey upon me as part of my in-group. It seems to be a really twisted form of tribalism. At least if you are in a gang or something all members of the gang agree that they are part of the same gang and understand what that means. This is all based on just sorting people between us and them and what is us and them isn&rsquo;t even clearly defined.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with the hate whitey discrimination I experience. Such behavior is totally illogical. Just because they do it doesn&rsquo;t justify doing the same thing but against non-whites. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like having some kind of extreme form of patriotism and consider all Americans your brother. Americans come in every shape or form, I don&rsquo;t see how an American would be any more or less my brother than a Russian. Maybe some basic similarity in experience or culture. But if citizenship were something someone had to declare, as a conscious choice and involved some kind of standards, then I could understand patriotism. Otherwise its just arbitrary distraction. It&rsquo;s akin to rooting for a football team just because you happen to live in that town at the time. It&rsquo;s just an arbitrary rivalry and it always seems to be expressed in a negative way here- hating others, putting others down, rather than positive- helping your ingroup, organizing productive goals etc. </p>
<p>Just as an example, you could easily build a white community. Gather up a handful of people and make one. There are plenty of private communities in America. It seems like the goal or point of race realism is hard to define here and boils down to just hating the other, or in the least insulting him.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s debatable. If they can spend 60 years tormenting us because of being told whites are evil, we can spend a few years in solidarity with other whites on account of the disregard (at best) that they&rsquo;ve shown us, for real.</p>

In many ways, I have more in common with the Asians in my class than I do with the loud, vulgar Whites who walk around with flat-billed baseball caps and listen to rap.</p>
<p>This is why my idea of a White nation is not one with policies that scrutinize one&rsquo;s ancestry with a fine-toothed comb and a magnifying glass. In my opinion, a country that is &gt;95% White <i>and committed to the idea of maintaining that racial/ethnic majority</i> could be reasonably considered a White nation. I do not worship &#8220;racial purity&#8221; or &#8220;blood.&#8221; There are core members of the AmRen community who have some American Indian blood, for instance. They are here because they consider themselves White - and so do I.</p>
<p>With all of this said, we must bear in mind that it would be appropriate for Whites to have <i>some</i> sort of racial identity. Asians, Blacks, Latinos, and others all do. The concept that &#8220;race is a social construct&#8221; is a delusion from which only Whites suffer.</p>
<p>As we dwindle to a smaller and smaller minority, our sense of kinship will grow proportionately. Because the fact of the matter is that our race is the expression of our common European ancestry. And ancestry matters. Knowing where we come from matters. And preserving our peoples through the generations to come matters.</p>

That&rsquo;s what Amren&rsquo;s endorsement of the anti-white John Engelman signifies. (Engelman <i>wants</i> whites to extinguish themselves - how can ceasing to exist be good for whites?) This review will quickly be forgotten. The effects of Engelman&rsquo;s deviousness, however, will be felt for far longer. I curse Amren&rsquo;s short-sightedness and desperation, truly I do.</p>

I have seen a few possible leftists buy a new Hyundai. I&rsquo;ll give it to the Nuevo rich among the immigrants. It&rsquo;s rare for them to buy an American car, but sometimes they actually do buy a fancy American car.

Ceteris paribus, people are more outraged by and also respond to outgroup on ingroup violence than they are by ingroup on ingroup violence. This is why thousands of blacks are taking to the streets to protest two black men dying at the hands of white men, while they ignore the thousands of black men that die at the hands of black men.</p>
<p>That also applies to us. I know that if I die before my time, through some sort of foul play, that it&rsquo;s significantly more likely to be at the hands of a white person than a black or other non-white person. However, I&rsquo;m more outraged at black on white crime because it&rsquo;s outgroup on ingroup.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example. If your brother slugs you in the face, or a neighbor slugs you in the face, who are you going to be more mad at? Right.</p>

I&rsquo;m not picking sides, but I can&rsquo;t blame him. Actually, I&rsquo;ll pick his side. I usually do, actually. We need all the help we can get. I&rsquo;ll stop there rather than say, &#8216;you&rsquo;re not helping&rsquo;. At least not in this case. You&rsquo;re embarrassing our cause.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s irony in what John says in a way, sometimes. It&rsquo;s certainly not limited to John. You know, the same folks who always say blacks are stupid, very quickly and loudly say, &#8220;But whites are more Creative than Asians. . . . etc. etc.<br/>
I suspect &#8216;the truth being on John&rsquo;s side&rsquo; is only icing on the cake for him. How many times can he listen to the post, &#8220;I&rsquo;m glad that liberal got killed, he deserved to be mugged (stated ever more crudely and crudely)&#8221; before he decides he doesn&rsquo;t mind hearing about one of us racial righties lose a job to an Asian or Indian? I think Martin Luther King would have something to say about this. . .<br/>
Heck, John&rsquo;s become one of you. I&rsquo;ve always know, you are ALL helping out hate-watch. haha. . . it&rsquo;s like listening to the different arms of our one party system pretend to fight. . .<br/>
At least John only wears only number 2 human-off, human repellent, when he posts. Some of us sport industrial strength.</p>

<p>I am particularly fascinated by tribes that preserved a paleolithic way of life into the twentieth century. The paleolithic era lasted for over two and a half million years ago. It had more of an effect on human evolution than what has happened to us since the beginning of agriculture. By studying paleolithic peoples we learn about our ancestors, and consequently ourselves.</p>

<p>My parents taught me not to hate blacks. I still try not too. Nevertheless, I have been the victim of several black crimes, and nearly murdered. That has made me willing to acknowledge regrettable facts about blacks most liberals do not like to be told about.</p>
<p>Over the years I have come reluctantly to suspect that in states with large black populations Jim Crow legislation was based on sound instinct. Nevertheless, the civil rights legislation has become part of the status quo. As a Burkian I think it would be unwise to repeal it. </p>
<p>I like the blacks I know. The most intelligent friend I have ever had was a black college professor. I sometimes patronize a neighborhood tavern where most of the regulars are black. They like me. I like them. One saved my life when four blacks mugged me.</p>

<p>The nature of the experiences seems to tell against this as they genuinely seem to feel very authentic to me, although possibly edited for grammer by Mr. Taylor. </p>
<p>Also it&rsquo;s good that you did something for AmRen, John. I need to become more involved myself (my real name also is John) although I&rsquo;m concerned my family may not understand my developing racism, and I&rsquo;m worried about repercussions at work.</p>

<p>Political correctness can be seen as lying on behalf of social harmony. It is difficult to say to a friend or co-worker, &#8220;I like you, but I think you belong to an inferior race.&#8221; </p>
<p>Nevertheless, if people at work discover your &#8220;developing racism&#8221; I suspect many of them will agree with you. Bosses tend to lean to the right, so your boss may have had problems with affirmative action.</p>
<p>The important thing is that you get along with each of your co-workers, and treat them as individuals, rather than as members of a race you may feel negatively about.</p>

Even if everyone knows that it true - no especially if they know it is true - such a person will be erased from everyone&rsquo;s invite list.</p>
<p>The insights of race realism, while true, have grim political implications. Whether than consider those implications, it is comforting to silence the messengers. </p>
<p>Liberals pretend that the solution can be found in more of what has not worked since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed, and since the War on Poverty was begun the same year. They pretend that we need more social reform, with the emphasis on affirmative action and controls on the police, and more social welfare spending.</p>
<p>Conservatives pretend that the problem is that blacks are confined to &#8220;the Democrat plantation,&#8221; which keeps them dependent. They maintain that if someone graduates from high school, takes any job available, and has no illegitimate children, that person will almost certainly not be poor. </p>
<p>In different ways liberals and conservatives ignore the increasingly importance of having a high IQ, and the fact that you have to be born with one.</p>

Tracy Abel wrote about her experiences working for an organization called &ldquo;Safe Horizon.&rdquo; This is a day care center for victims of domestic violence.</p>
<p> Safe Horizon reminds me superficially of the Community for Creative Non Violence in Washington, DC. I have not had any association with CCNV since the early 1970&rsquo;s. Back then CCNV was, if you can imagine such a thing, a Roman Catholic urban commune loosely affiliated with the University of George Washington and the University of Georgetown, and engaged in anti war activism. </p>
<p> I met members of CCNV at a coffee house I patronized. On Sundays they would hold folk masses at their headquarters. These would be followed by a pot luck supper. I frequently attended these. The only members of CCNV who were sexually intimate were married to each other. I briefly dated a woman I met there. We never touched each other.  </p>
<p>     Since the end of the War in Vietnam the Community for Creative Non Violence has become involved with helping homeless people and with homeless advocacy. </p>
<p>     I mention this because Tracy Abel did not like the people she worked with at Safe Horizon. She did not like the people they helped. I wonder how people who remembered her at Safe Horizon would describe her. I wonder how she would describe the Community for Creative Non Violence. </p>
<p>     Statistics are important. How we look at individuals, organizations, and groups of people is influenced by what we look with. Our feelings influence our reality perceptions.</p>

<p>ALL politicians care about rich people because it is the rich who are making donations.  Solyndra execs received millions from Obama and returned thousands to him.  Do you think they are &#8220;poor&#8221;?  Soros donates billions.  Do you think Dems don&rsquo;t dance to his tune?  The Sierra Club <a href="http://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_17_01/tsc_17_01_lamm_sierra.shtml" rel="nofollow">took $101 million from David Gelbaum</a> and his condition was that they not oppose immigration.  Result: end of Sierra Club opposition to immigration. Did you perhaps fail to notice that the Sierra Club is a leftist outfit that is the darling of the Democrats, and vice versa?</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi (millionaire) and her husband (millionaire) moved one of their factories to Guam so that they don&rsquo;t have to pay their workers minimum wage.  Is that what you call looking out for the little guy?</p>
<p>Our current Golfer-in-Chief is You Know Who and, last I heard, he wasn&rsquo;t a rich, greedy Republican.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really sad that you think generic human traits are distributed according to party preference.  Why not take the view that the desire for power is a trait that is common to all humans?  That only Democrats are altruistic is absurd.  Just as is the notion that Republicans are.</p>
<p>The effect of policies is what matters.  By that measure, the compassionate Lyndon Johnson and his congressional pals were &#8220;compassionate&#8221; Dems but the welfare dependency they created has done more to harm black people than 10 regiments of Republican golfers.</p>
