<h1 class="title">White Renegade of the Year-2014</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Gregory Hood, American Renaissance, December 19, 2014</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
Who did the most damage when he could have done the most good?</div> 
</div> 



<p>To be a white renegade, it&rsquo;s not enough simply to act against the interests of whites. You have to know better-or at least show signs that you know better. You have to have the capacity to act in defense of your people but consciously choose to turn away from their interests.</p>
<p><a href="../../../features/2013/12/white-renegade-of-the-year.html">Rand Paul was our first award winner</a> because he consciously chose to act against his own stated beliefs in order to remain acceptable to the political establishment. This year, we nominate a CEO whose name is synonymous with the software industry and arguably the greatest leap in human potential in history. We describe, with much regret, the choices of a powerful man who uses his wealth and opportunity to undermine the country, culture, and people that made his accomplishments possible.</p>
<p>The White Renegade of the Year for 2014 is Bill Gates.</p>
<p><strong>A question of intelligence</strong></p>
<p>Bill Gates is a member of that first generation of the software industry, someone who figured things out for himself. He had an unimpeachably WASP upbringing, but dropped out of Harvard in 1975 and started &ldquo;Micro-Soft&rdquo; after reading about the Altair 8800 in <em>Popular Mechanics</em> and realizing normal people were going to start using microcomputers<em>. </em>He built his company from the ground up when he spotted an opening for software developers for emerging computer companies.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Mr. Gates&rsquo;s strategy relied on skillful manipulation of copyright, maintaining Microsoft&rsquo;s freedom to deal with as many hardware companies as possible while jealously guarding his market share by any means necessary. Like many great businessmen, Mr. Gates realized that the key to success is not just a good product, but market access and control over distribution. Mr. Gates is, in short, a successful monopolist, rather than a creative artist <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2013/09/jobs/">like Steve Jobs</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Gates also realized that the tech industry was in a fierce competition for high-IQ workers. He famously said his biggest adversary was Goldman Sachs, because they were competing with him for the brightest employees. Unfortunately for him, <em>Griggs vs. Duke Power </em>makes it difficult to use IQ tests for job interviews because of the &ldquo;disparate impact&rdquo; such tests have on blacks. Therefore, Microsoft&rsquo;s job interviews featured word teasers and other questions specifically designed to get the effect of IQ tests without actually using them. There is an example at the end of this article.</p>
<p>Bill Gates is known to be obsessed with IQ. After traveling the country for five days with Mr. Gates, a reporter from <em>Forbes </em><a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2005/1031/045.html">said</a> that he &#8220;must have talked about IQ a hundred times. Getting the brightest bulbs to work at Microsoft has always been his obsession.&rdquo; Years later, the same reporter <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/richkarlgaard/2010/09/07/the-trillion-dollar-iq-business/">noted</a> that &ldquo;Gates has always loved IQ . . . . It never seems to occur to Gates that IQ has become a politically incorrect subject for many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though he has not run Microsoft for some time, Mr. Gates remains passionately interested in IQ. He <a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2009/02/bill-gates-vs-bill-gates.html">stresses</a> the importance of raw intelligence in his public statements, and he is clearly aware of one of the great challenges of a globalized economy-the low IQ of people in developing countries. In a speech in July 2013, Mr. Gates <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/bill-gates-on-education-patents-microsoft-bob-and-disease/">noted</a> that &ldquo;the average IQ in sub-Saharan Africa is about 82.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill Gates&rsquo;s, whose own intelligence is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/15/walter-isaacson-bill-gates-steve-jobs_n_1094975.html">legendary</a>, got that figure from a study in the January-February 2010 issue of <em><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289609000634">Intelligence</a>.</em><em> </em>The article was a reply to Richard Lynn&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.washsummit.com/shop/iq-and-global-inequality"><em>IQ and Global Inequality</em></a><em>, </em>which estimated the average IQ of sub-Saharan Africans at around 70. However, the authors largely agreed with <em>IQ and Global Inequality&rsquo;s </em>other estimates of intelligence, and 82 is still very low. Mr. Gates can&rsquo;t pretend to be ignorant of racial differences in intelligence or their implications.</p>
<p>In the same speech, though, Mr. Gates added that the low African IQ has &#8220;nothing to do with genetics or race or anything like that-that&rsquo;s disease and that&rsquo;s what disease does to you, and that&rsquo;s why these things are such an extreme poverty trap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, intelligence depends to some extent on environment. The Rockefeller Foundation&rsquo;s campaign against hookworm <a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2010/07/guardian-lower-iqs-found-in-disease.html">raised IQ</a> in the South, and the Gates foundation <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">has spent</a> many millions of dollars to reduce iodine deficiency-a leading cause of mental retardation-in the developing world. But preventing brain damage in Kazakhstan isn&rsquo;t going to supply the kind of brain power Mr. Gates needed at Microsoft, nor will it eliminate the racial IQ gap.</p>
<p>If genetics don&rsquo;t account for differences in ability between ethnic groups, what does? Mr. Gates finds the answer in the environmental determinism of <a href="/">Jared Diamond&rsquo;s <em>Guns, Germs and Steel</em></a><em>. </em>He <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/17/bill-gates-the-world-until-yesterday">says</a> of the book,</p>
<blockquote><p>I had never read anything that explained so much about human history. None of the classes I took in high school or college answered what I thought was one of the biggest and most important questions about history: Why do some societies advance so much faster and further than others?</p></blockquote>
<p>He may not actually believe this. One of the books Mr. Gates says is &ldquo;on his shelf&rdquo; is <em>Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age.</em> <a href="http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Broken-Genius">On his blog</a>, Mr. Gates posts the publisher&rsquo;s description-which details how Shockley&rsquo;s &ldquo;campaigning about race, intelligence and genetics . . . destroyed his reputation&rdquo;-without comment.</p>
<p>William Shockley won the Nobel Prize for helping invent the transistor, but he thought the fight against dysgenics was more important. As Thomas Jackson <a href="/news/2010/08/william_shockle.html">noted</a> in <em>American Renaissance</em><em>, </em>as a result of his courage and persistence, Shockley may have been the &ldquo;most reviled man in America&rdquo; when he died in 1989. Mr. Gates may see Shockley&rsquo;s experience as a warning: If he cares about his reputation he better keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>Either way, neither iodine tablets nor Jared Diamond&rsquo;s bromides will do anything to supply the high IQ employees that Microsoft needs to stay competitive. And Mr. Gates is no longer promoting a culture of high IQ, but spending billions of dollars on failed efforts that make things worse.</p>
<p>The Gates Foundation has poured billions into Africa on the assumption, as Mr. Gates <a href="http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/How-Asia-Works">explains</a>, that transforming Africa into another Asia is a technical question, a matter of finding the right &ldquo;formula.&rdquo; Mr. Gates&rsquo; own billions are not enough-he <a href="/">tells</a> Northern European countries that have no history of African colonialism that they also need to cough up their people&rsquo;s money to &ldquo;invest&rdquo; in Africa.</p>
<p>Bill Gates does, however, deserve credit for promoting contraception in poor countries, including Africa. The <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Family-Planning">Gates Foundation</a> says it wants to pay for birth control for &#8220;an additional 120 million women and girls in the poorest countries by 2020.&#8221; Mr. Gates is also spending millions on a new <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/10/wireless-birth-control_n_5568336.html">implantable contraceptive</a> that could work for as long as 18 years, and be turned off and on wirelessly from outside the body. His foundation has paid for research on new materials for <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/11/22/bill_melinda_gates_foundation_unveils_11_prototypes_for_a_better_feeling.html">condoms</a> that are tougher but also provide greater sensation.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>From 2000 to 2009, Bill Gates spent $2 billion trying to create smaller class sizes in American schools. The avowed <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/the-plot-against-public-education-111630.html#.VJITyHsjjMg">justification</a> was that Mr. Gates was &ldquo;terrified for our workforce of tomorrow.&rdquo; Much of the money <a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2009/02/bill-gates-admits-hes-blown-2-billion.html">went to efforts</a> headed by, of all people, Bill Ayers&rsquo;s brother Rick, as well as other hard-left activists. In 2009, after grades did not improve despite smaller class sizes, Mr. Gates admitted failure, but various leftists no doubt enjoyed Mr. Gates&rsquo; paying their salaries for close to a decade.</p>
<p>Bill Gates then moved on to championing Common Core. He crushed opposition by simply <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bill-gates-pulled-off-the-swift-common-core-revolution/2014/06/07/a830e32e-ec34-11e3-9f5c-9075d5508f0a_story.html?hpid=z1">buying off</a> expert opinion on both the Left and Right, and awarding $233 million in grants to groups that would promote this new education scheme. Among these was the National Council of La Raza, and an &ldquo;educational foundation&rdquo; headed by pro-amnesty Republican and <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/jeb-bush-actively-exploring-presidential-run-a-candidate-whose-only-discernible-idea-is-contempt-for-the-gop-base">possible</a> presidential candidate Jeb Bush.</p>
<p>Mr. Gates <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bill-gates-pulled-off-the-swift-common-core-revolution/2014/06/07/a830e32e-ec34-11e3-9f5c-9075d5508f0a_story.html">says</a> the goal is to solve the &ldquo;huge problem that low-income kids get less good education than suburban kids get.&rdquo; <a href="../../../features/2013/12/the-latest-educational-gimmick.html">As described at <em>American Renaissance</em></a><em>, </em>what Common Core actually means is more jargon-heavy leftist indoctrination and impossible demands to close &ldquo;racial achievement gaps.&rdquo; Fourth graders, for example, will now <a href="/news/2013/10/common-core-indoctrinating-fourth-graders-about-white-privilege.html">have to learn</a> about &ldquo;white privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The squeeze on whites </strong></p>
<p>Bill Gates also promotes mass immigration that pushes European-Americans out of the tech industry. In 2013, he <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/29/tech-companies-lobbying-immigration-facebook-family-visas/2121179/">joined</a> Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s FWD.us, a tech industry group that pushed amnesty. FWD.us has already spent $13.8 million on lobbying, vastly more than the $80,000 the National Council of La Raza spent on it during the same period.</p>
<p>Bill Gates <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/immigration-reform-bill-gates-103331.html">began 2014</a> by demanding more immigration, calling our current laws an &ldquo;injustice.&rdquo; He also put $25 million towards a scholarship fund for &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; youth-with the CEO of the Washington Post, Don Graham, as another financier.</p>
<p>In February, Mr. Gates stepped aside as chairman of the board at Microsoft, but retained an advisory role. His replacement was <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101352869">Satya Nadella</a>, an Indian whose ascension was immediately <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101389299#.">hailed</a> as an ethnic triumph for non-whites that will spur &ldquo;Indian technologists in the U.S. to pursue high-profile positions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the summer, Bill Gates <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-11/gates-adelson-and-buffett-scold-congress-on-immigration.html">joined forces</a> with Warren Buffett and Sheldon Adelson to push for amnesty. In a July 10 editorial co-signed with these two men, Mr. Gates bemoaned the primary defeat of Eric Cantor and said it should not stop progress towards amnesty. After all, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/opinion/sheldon-adelson-warren-buffett-and-bill-gates-on-immigration-reform.html">editorial</a> argued, &ldquo;for those who wish to stay and work in computer science or technology, <em>fields badly in need of their services</em>, let&rsquo;s roll out the welcome mat.&rdquo; [Emphasis added]</p>
<p>Only one week later, Microsoft <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyclay/2014/07/20/microsoft-layoffs-also-impact-thousands-of-contractors/">announced</a> it was laying off 18,000 workers-14 percent of the full-time workforce-in the largest layoff in the company&rsquo;s history. Thousands of contract workers also <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2014/internal-memo-microsoft-cut-external-staff-18-months-requiring-six-month-break/">found</a> their hours slashed. As Senator Jeff Sessions <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/212599-sessions-teases-gates-call-for-immigrant-workers-yet-lays-off-18k">pointed out</a>, it makes no sense to import more STEM workers when 75 percent of Americans with STEM degrees aren&rsquo;t working in the field, and when the very companies that are lobbying for amnesty are laying off workers.</p>
<p>But Bill Gates has an even more explicit agenda: The Gates Millennium Scholars Program offers &ldquo;good through graduation&rdquo; scholarships to students of every ethnic group-except whites. Microsoft&rsquo;s Indian CEO proudly announced just this month that &ldquo;we will make progress every year towards building a more diverse workforce and creating opportunities at every level of the company for all of Microsoft&rsquo;s employees.&#8221; The title of Julie Bort&rsquo;s article on the announcement in <em><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ceo-vows-hire-more-195404732.html">Business Insider</a> </em>was &ldquo;Microsoft CEO Vows To Hire More People Who Are Not White Or Male.&rdquo; Mr. Nadella&rsquo;s adviser in this effort is Jesse Jackson, who <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/394699/jesse-jackson-compares-lack-diversity-tech-segregation-katherine-timpf">compares</a> the lack of black computer programmers to segregation.</p>
<p>Bill and Melinda Gates&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;philanthropy&rdquo; is becoming more overtly political, including <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/26/technology/gates-gun-control/">million dollar donations</a> to gun control groups. Other Microsoft execs joined this effort, which may <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-weisser/bill-gates-guns_b_5721788.html">represent</a> a movement that will make whites even more <a href="/news/2012/12/whites-and-guns.html">vulnerable</a> to non-white violence.</p>
<p><strong>The missed opportunity</strong></p>
<p>Rich capitalists are nothing new. Yet the captains of industry of the past usually thought they had a duty to invest in the future of the country. Many of our great museums, universities, libraries, and cultural institutions were founded by those who built vast fortunes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>What will be Bill Gates&rsquo;s legacy? He&rsquo;s helping turn America into something like Windows Vista-a mediocrity that trades off a legacy earned during better times. If Silicon Valley promotes affirmative-action jobs instead of pioneering innovation, America will be driven out of the technology sector.</p>
<p>This is a betrayal not just of whites but of what Silicon Valley once represented. It used to stand for the idea of a Jeffersonian meritocracy-an aristocracy of talent composed of smart, hard-working, ambitious people who created things that were genuinely new and exciting. It was a place where accomplishment counted for more than political correctness, where intelligence trumped ideology. Today, Bill Gates pushes the ideology of egalitarianism rather than the importance of IQ.</p>
<p>Mr. Gates may hold the distinction of having wasted more money than any single person in history <a href="/">who doesn&rsquo;t work for the United States government</a>. He had the chance to do an enormous amount of good for his people and his country but he muffed it. He has given us no vision to aspire to, no dream to inspire us. He has become a glorified custodian for a nation that has <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/john-derbyshire-asks-muslims-to-the-rescue-ebola-and-the-cant-do-nation">lost its way</a>.</p>

<p>Re William Shockley: There has been a curious effort in recent years on those midnight radio shows to claim that extraterrestrial aliens gave us the technology that allowed us to invent the transistor. The hosts of those shows like to claim that they and their guests are telling us what the government doesn&rsquo;t want us to know, oblivious to the fact that their midnight radio shows are on hundreds of radio stations, every one of them has an FCC license. Meanwhile, how often is Jared Taylor seen or heard on FCC licensed media? I happen to think that there&rsquo;s a revisionist history effort afoot to edit William Shockley out of the invention of the transistor, and that TPTB would be happy with people thinking that ET did it rather than a white &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

<p>With questions like these you need to think about your answer. They are often trick questions. For example, with number 5, when you go north one mile you may think you take a 90 degree turn, but it is much less at the north pole.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-670823" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The source of the confusion with that question is that people are used to the Mercator projection of maps of mid-latitude and lower geographical features, meaning that all lines of latitude and longitude make perfect right angles. So when most people get a question of south one mile, left turn (implication of 90 degrees), east one mile, left turn again, north one mile, they&rsquo;ll always conclude that they&rsquo;ll be one mile east of where they started, because they&rsquo;re thinking of the Mercator map of their city.</p>
<p>Even though many of us provided what is the right answer, that the starting point of this riddle is the North Pole, it still confuses some because they think after walking south a mile from it (the only direction one can go from the NP), they turn left a full 90 degrees, then they walk east by walking a mile in the 90 degree right angle line motion from that point. They can do that, but if they do that, they are by definition not walking east, because very near the poles, cardinal directions are seemingly messed up. If they did walk in that 90 degree straight line, geographically, they would be traveling more of a southeast than a pure east. To go directly east, they&rsquo;d have to walk in a circular motion.</p>

A Man leaves camp one day and walks due south one (any small number will do, as long as it is the same one repeated in each direction) mile. He turns due east (or west) and walks that direction for another mile and stops. He shoots a bear. He then walks due north a mile, and arrives back at base camp. What color is the bear? I suspect the author of the above article made the mistake.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-675014" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is a pretty easy question and the only right answer would be white. If you go north no matter where you start at you will end up at the north pole eventually. I don&rsquo;t see what is complicated about that. If someone goes a mile east and then turns north and is no longer a mile east, it must be the north pole. I would say low I.Q. is about the only way to get confused by these questions, although one question is not sufficient to measure it, given enough of these it should produce a pretty accurate gauge.</p>

If it said simply &#8220;a bear walks the following path&#8221; I would have attempted to deduce its color from the question overall. But, since it starts with imagine, I answered that the bear could be any color I chose, which was chartreuse, because I was prompted to choose it and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the bear does beyond that first part of the question. However, I think the answer of a polar bear is correct since he went south then east then north and ended up where he started without heading west. This can only occur if the starting point was the north pole.</p>

<p> In general there is too much diversity and specialization in the computer field. This makes it difficult to keep a job. It usually takes a year or two to master a new speciality. If the specialty is replaced by something else, employers like to fire everyone who learned the old specialty and hire new people who already know the new speciality.

<p>Consumers bought off the shelf hardware, put together their own box, grabbed free copies of software (pirated) from the stash from the workplace and a standard was born. Once you learned to use DOS, why would you switch? Microsoft never made anything that was &#8220;best&#8221; but simply bought up innovation using the DOS money machine.</p>

Thousands of contract workers also found their hours slashed. As Senator Jeff Sessions pointed out, it makes no sense to import more STEM workers when 75 percent of Americans with STEM degrees aren&rsquo;t working in the field, and when the very companies that are lobbying for amnesty are laying off workers.</p>
<p>- Gregory Hood, American Renaissance, December 19, 2014 </p>
<p>Microsoft represents a direction American corporations are moving in. Most of them are becoming increasingly predatory toward their employees. </p>
<p>The Democrats have not been able to exploit this because most whites do not trust the Democratic Party on racial issues.</p>
<p> During the New Deal most whites did trust the Democrats on racial issues. The Immigration Act of 1924 restricted non white immigration. 90 percent of the U.S. population was white. Most blacks were denied equal rights. Franklin Roosevelt deftly avoided civil rights issues. He knew the solid south was his to lose.</p>

One this one, you are seriously delusional. The majority of whites in America do not trust the Democratic Party because it is the Democratic Party. The Democrats once may have represented national development and have carried the cause of the common man in manner worthy of the respect of those who were not themselves common. Not no more. Today the Democratic Party represents the counterculture and the worst impulses of the elites, and promotes anti-Americanism among new Americans, among other things. The Democratic Party, I guarantee you, does not want a rational system of universal health insurance or an acceptable program of immigration reform and amnesty adopted. If these two issues were taken off the table, minorities would leave the Democratic Party in droves, and then where would the Democrats be? Minorities already have started leaving in some numbers anyway. If I was a Democrat, I would be scared, very scared. Slippage long has been their greatest fear. And now it is beginning to manifest itself. The national coalition of Democrats is predicated on an 95 percent plurality within the black vote, 70 percent of the Hispanic and Asian votes and some immutable percentage of the white votes. Without all of these numbers, the Democrats will have a tough time winning a national election. Do you really think, with Jeb Bush and his Hispanic wife, Hispanics are going to vote 70 percent and more for screechy Hillary Clinton or loopy Elizabeth Warren? Please.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-670271" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This scumbag Gates is just another in the long line of those who think that the human tool of science can be turned on ourselves in order to make something that only God can make. This thing has been called many things over the years, perhaps most famously the &#8220;New Soviet Man.&#8221; The idea that Man can be his own God is a clinically insane notion born of the unprecedented success of Whites, and it is the foundation of all the disastrous Leftist crimes.</p>
<p>Our overwhelming materialist success has led us into a trap where we mistake our material success for moral superiority. We think that technology is now the key to human perfection and utopia. We are using a pickaxe on our souls.</p>
<p>And because utopia and human perfection has proved to be impossible, Leftist imbeciles and power mongers find it necessary to become ever more oppressive and ever more divorced from reality. Everything in the Leftist agenda has failed miserably, and so Leftists must now constantly redefine failure as success and force the rest of us to bow down to their false God. As a result, everything is now based on a narrative of lies, fantasies and false assumptions that inevitably lead to what Sam Francis called Anarcho-Tyranny.</p>
<p>We now worship a bizarro-world religion in which cowardice is courage; victimhood is morally-superior heroism; ignorance is transcendent wisdom; deviance is normal; lying is The Truth and the accumulated wisdom of centuries is consigned to the waste bin.</p>
<p>And the very tool of science, since it has failed to remake human nature, must now be distorted to support the lies of nonWhite superiority; global warming and any number of perfectly insane suppositions. </p>
<p>We are living in a new world of secular superstition and self-worship. As the Leftist elites grow in power, our society more and more resembles a Godless feudal system in which the masses are all lowered to a politically-correct, lowest-common-denominator while the Leftist elites roll in unaccountable wealth and power.</p>
<p>We must now realize that although Whites are superior to every other race, including the rigid, hivemind North Asians, we are just another player in the game of wealth and power that has been played since the beginning of time. We need true humility to start winning again. And the first thing we need to win back is every square inch of our land. That will start happening soon, and it will be extremely unpleasant, but it will also be our finest hour.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-670446" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Remember, at and very near the poles, cardinal directions are weird and distorted. At the north pole, the only possible straight line direction to travel is south. At the equator, if you go east, and keep going east, then you&rsquo;ll eventually circle back to where you started after traveling about 25,000 miles, all the while the circle you made has the north pole as its center if you view it from way over the north pole from space. The higher in latitude you go north of the equator, the smaller the circle gets in total number of miles, however, what remains the same is that you&rsquo;re doing a circle around the north pole. So if you&rsquo;re at the north pole, you&rsquo;re at latitude 90 degrees north. If you travel south (the only direction possible there) ten feet, you&rsquo;re at latitude 89.99999&hellip;. north. Once you&rsquo;re there, you go east by walking around the north pole in a concentric circle that has a radius of ten feet, circumference about 62.8 feet. Which means going around the world at the equator by going east was a journey of 25,000 miles, but doing it at latitude ten feet short of 90 N is only a journey of 62.8 feet.</p>
<p>North pole, south 10 feet, east 10 feet (remember, walk in a circle to walk east), then north 10 feet, and you&rsquo;re back at the north pole.</p>

There is far more evidence out there for nature overpowering nurture in the end. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-672465" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It&rsquo;s because the definition of success has changed. Hugh Hefner played a large role in this. He once said that what was interesting to him was not that he had lived out other men&rsquo;s fantasies, but that he had lived out his own.</p>
<p>In our age, the definition of success has become living out your own fantasy while giving the rest of the world a small window on your doings. And being prominent enough that other people want to look. In Hef&rsquo;s case, the window he gave was displaying nude pictures of his girlfriends and the footloose women living in his mansion in his magazine. For other people, it may play out differently. But the idea always is the same.</p>
<p>Compare that to success before Hefner. Back then, it was having a house in the high-priced corner of the neighborhood, owning an expensive car and being generally prominent. The common man in that world might console himself with the thought that he could live out a lesser facsimile of the same life. He could earn a steady income, own a house, drive a good car, and belong to the same club and church as one of the leading lights. Not no more.</p>

<p>Gates is proof that money and power are fungible and that even if he takes a hit to his nominal wealth, it behooves him to do so if he can reduce the American standard of living and somewhat raise the standard in other countries until he has a worldwide pool of potential labor to draw upon and that these people are all dependent upon the wealthy elite as a client class. This is the new serfdom - people of marginal means who can barely get by and a few who are more intelligent who can act as overseers yet be controlled through fear of being shut out and returned to the bottom rungs of society.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-673666" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Bill Gates is a brilliant monopolist, not technologist. MS DOS was first purchased from another programmer who had written it. It was originally called QDOS (quick and dirty operating system). It was very primitive, little more than a program loader. MS Windows was originally layered over DOS. It was an architectural monster and prone to crashes. Microsoft didn&rsquo;t have a real operating system until Windows NT was created. (All current Microsoft PC operating systems are derived from Windows NT.) </p>
<p>The real brilliance of Microsoft is in how it sold its operating systems. The PC business is brutally competitive. PCs are commodities, and whoever shaves 10 bucks off the cost of production wins. Bill Gates knew this. So he offered manufacturers a choice of two licenses:<br/>
1. A conventional license. You payed $X per machine shipped with a Microsoft OS.<br/>
2. The monopolist license. You payed $Y per machine shipped, whether it had a Microsoft OS on it or not.</p>
<p>X was much greater than Y. So, since manufacturers expected to mostly ship Microsoft OS&rsquo;s, they all chose license 2. But this meant that no competitor could ever get a foothold, since for any machine shipped the manufacturer had to pay Microsoft $Y, and any license for a different OS was in addition to that. This meant it was always cheaper to ship a Microsoft OS machine, no matter how cheap the competing OS was.</p>

Since bears native to the Arctic are coastal animals we could safely assume the bear had been brought by a second party to its location, making its original habitat irrelevant. The vast majority of bears are brown.</p>

Once they become rich the phone starts ringing off the hook from organizations looking for handouts - so you get a secretary to screen them out. Then you become super rich. That`s when the game changes.</p>
<p>The `gibs` calls start coming from people like you. You get to attend lavish gatherings with others who have succeeded like you. Most of these functions revolve around charities of one sort or another. This becomes your social milieu, these people become your friends. Instead of concentrating only on growing your company you begin playing Master of the Universe with your friends. Since you and your friend share your time at largely charitable gatherings your activities as Master of the Universe tend to focus on the bottom of society. After years and decades of this sort of activity you become oblivious to the damage you are now doing to younger versions of yourself. If Bill had to live under the constrains he advocates imposing on anyone with drive and ambition no one would have ever heard of Microsoft or of Bill Gates.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-672400" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Not necessarily. There is an script that equates IQs with the median on various standardized test (IQs of Greatest Geniuses). Not everyone with high SATs has an IQ above the median for their aptitudes test level. That could be the case with Gates. The lowest IQ I personally have know of with perfect (1600) SATs was 130. One Hollywood actress scored 1600 on her SATs, but has a reported IQ of 137. The median IQ for 1600 SATs is 168. That means half above and half below if anyone needs to be reminded.</p>
<p>My tested IQ is 136. My SAT scores and all of my GRE administrations norm to an IQ of at least 140, the highest an IQ of 157. Not that I believe that for a minute. What it all means is anyone&rsquo;s guess. All Bill Gate&rsquo;s SAT scores prove is that he has an IQ over 130. And all his IQ proves is that he is smart. No one is arguing that, but what it all means is uncertain. NFL QB Ryan Fitzpatrick (Harvard) has a reported SAT composite of 158 (new test, though). No one expects him to start the world&rsquo;s leading software monopoly. You&rsquo;ll have to look for other reasons for Gate&rsquo;s success. Let&rsquo;s consider character, let&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had never read anything that explained so much about . . .what I thought was one of the biggest and most important questions about history: Why do some societies advance so much faster and further than others? &#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas Wade demolishing Jared Diamond&rsquo;s argument   &mdash;   from my notes on A TROUBLESOME INHERITANCE: Genes, Race and Human History, pp 117-118):</p>
<p>Jared Diamond&rsquo;s assertion that believing in race is like believing in a flat earth is based on this logic: 1) There are many &#8220;equally valid procedures&#8221; for defining human races, 2) All are incompatible, and therefore all are equally absurd. Diamond&rsquo;s example: Italians, Greeks and Nigerians carry genes that confer resistance to malaria. Swedes and Xhosas have not such genes. Resistance to malaria is just as good a criterion as skin color. Since the two methods for identifying race (skin color and genetic resistance to malaria) lead to contradictory results, ALL racial classifications of the human species is impossible. </p>
<p>Two fatal flaws in Diamond&rsquo;s argument: 1) The implied premise that people are assigned to races by the single criterion of skin color. People belong to a race not by virtue of any single trait, but by a cluster of criteria that includes skin color and hair, and the shape of eyes, nose and skull. It&rsquo;s not necessary for all of these traits to be present. East Asians without the EDAR allele, which causes thick black hair, are still East Asians.<br/>
2) Making genes that confer resistance to malaria a criterion for classification of race makes no evolutionary sense. Malaria became a significant human disease only 6,000 years ago. Greeks and Italians resist it because of a mutation that also causes Thalassemia [a form of anemia] whereas Africans resist malaria because of a different mutation, one that causes a different kind of anemia, sickle-cell anemia. In any case, resistance to malaria is a trait acquired secondarily to race.</p>

He answered that the bear was white in less than a minute. Naturally I asked why. He said polar bears live at the north pole, polar bears are white, and the poles are the only place a bear can walk three miles in three directions and end up back where he started from-ie, triangle&hellip;<br/>
Makes sense to me. So I read on further, and find out this is correct.<br/>
Now as much as I want to believe that my grandson is outstandingly brilliant (of COURSE he is!) but he is still only 10 years old, so Bill Gates must want adult workers who reason at and are educated to the level of a normal White American 10 year old. Guess who that is.</p>

<p>I read Jared Diamond&rsquo;s &#8220;Guns, Germs, and Steel&#8221; years ago and it led me to believe that blacks had a higher IQ than whites. Then some years later I read Murray&rsquo;s &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; and reversed my opinion. Guns, Germs, and Steel, is a flawed work I believe. I think there may be some critical reviews about that. His other book &#8220;Collapse&#8221; is also not so hot. I got it but couldn&rsquo;t finish it, or if I did I forgot what it said.</p>

However, he too does not use his intelligence to save his own race. He wants cheap labor and is looking at getting it from abroad from people like the Indians and Chinese. After all he too is a greedy business man looking at keeping his company&rsquo;s profits high by hiring low wage IT workers to work for him and not legal Americans that will want a higher wage to have a higher standard of living. He puts money before his race and that is where he is not using his intelligence. By lying to Congress and saying that America needs immigrants because American workers have no skills, when they actually have those skills, he is being a traitor to his own nation that gave him the opportunity to become successful and he in turn is not giving back to America by helping his own people become successful. So Shame on him and he deserves the White Renegade of the Year Award</p>

The key to the monopoly is create a situation where it is near impossible to create an operating system that will run Windows application. This is done by putting elements into the operating system that properly belong to the application.</p>
<p>Gates learned software development making applications for Apple. To him, what he is doing in normal and he will never stop until he is forced to. His most egregious violation was his sabotage of Java. Sun envisioned Java as program which would run on any software platform, with Java applications portable between platforms. Microsoft sabotaged this effort by customizing Java so that applications no longer would be portable between Java in different platforms. Gates claimed that he did this to make Java work better within Windows. Yeah.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s antitrust suit against Microsoft was against Internet Explorer. By the time it was heard, Microsoft&rsquo;s effort to monopolize the internet already had failed. The government&rsquo;s lawyer in the case was David Boies. The same David Boise who was Al Gore&rsquo;s lead lawyer in the 2000 Florida recount. Go figure, people.</p>

If IBM hadn&rsquo;t ignored PC&rsquo;s in the beginning and panicked about Apples rapid growth, they wouldn&rsquo;t have given away the intellectual rights to control the operation system software to Microsoft and the Hardware to Intel. Microsoft used that enormous cash machine and bought up every innovation in software just like Google has been doing in the last decade. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Libertarian in the micro-scale but computers, software, and any industry that enjoys unfair advantages due to size and combat ability need to be punitively taxed. What happened with Gates was he is playing god with his completely untaxed 60 billion in capitol gains while the rest of us foot the government that protects his wealth.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-674184" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Excellent article, Mr. Gregory Hood!! You have revealed the unabashed evil of Bill Gates. Several things especially stood out for me about Gates as I read your excellent article: 1) Gates is a Tabula Rasa theorist. He, like many these days, completely discounts the importance and power of genetics in shaping human behavior. He seems to literally think that Negroes are capable of building and maintaining the cultures creates by Whites and Orientals. He never even thinks to ask the question of genetics when discussing IQ. He probably thinks that a Negro baby born to a mother in a village deep in The Congo, fathered by one of countless random men the mothef has slept with, can be imported to a bastion of Anglo-Celtic culture such as Vermont, Nova Scotia, or Maine, as a baby, adopted and raised by blue eyed Anglo-Celtic parents in an all White community, and grow up to be the perfect Oreo Cookie. Black as coal on the surface, yet behaviorally identical with the most exemplary of White Americans. Gates envisions such a person as easily growing to have an IQ of 110 or higher, as well as the same emotional fabric as any of our more exemplary White Americans. Apparently, to Gates, the 82 IQ of Black Africans results purely from nurture. Genetics, to him, do not exist. A newborn baby is a clean slate to be written on. All that matters is that adults write on that slate properly. While Mr. Gates is a brilliant man when it comes to business methods and building electronics, he is a complete idiot when it comes to Psychology. He obviously is clueless in his ability to observe human behavior, and has also never taken a Psychology course. Psychologists have found zero scientific validation for Tabula Rasa theories, and the evidence agsinst Tabula Rasa theories abounds. Barack Obama is a poster child for all of this. He was raised by his White Grandparents in a White/Asian milieu. The only Negro in his high school class. According to Tabula Rasa theories, he should be as White as Garrison Keillor. So, what went wrong with Barack, Bill Gates?? What is your bad excuse for Obama&rsquo;s hatred of Whites, and his desire to grant the Negro race a free pass to loot, rape, and murder Whites?? According to Tabula Rasa theories, he should be the quintessential Oreo Cookie, telling Blacks that Michael Brown was shot he attacked Officer Darren Wilson. How did this Mulatto, raised in what you would describe as quintessential White Privilege, manage to became the quintessential Black bigot, hater of Whites, and defender of Black sociopathy?? If you understood Psychology, Bill Gates, you would know the answer to this question. The answer in genetics. Nature, in the end, will always prevail over Nurture. Tabula Rasa theories are hogwash. Western societies have been bitten in the butt enough by our failed attempts to inculturate Negroes into White culture. It is never going to work. You can take the Negro out of Africa, but cannot take Africa out of the Negro. Period. Race is the bedrock upon which our personalities and temperaments are build. Would you try to build your billion dollar estate on shifting sands Mr. Gates?? Apparently you would. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-675622" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I watched some news shows from alternative media. Bill Gates gave a speech stating that vaccines can be used to lower global population. Later he said he meant better health meant less child births. People in Afirca and elsewhere commonly believe they will be sterilized if they get vaccines. A medical lab analyzed several of them. Most batches have 1/3 of samples contaminated by chemicals that should not be there and do sterilize. The vaccines themselves do not sterilize people, but the additives they put in there are. They just claim it &#8220;accidentally&#8221; got in there and nothing is done about it. Some batches appear to be clean but many of them they seem to contaminate about 1/3 of them. The goal seems to be to sterilize about 1/3 of females in the third world as a population reduction method. There are also chemicals that lower male fertility in the food, as well as a lot of estrogen mimics that lower fertility and also increase the number of females born. There was a Canadian TV special called &#8220;the vanish male&#8221; the documented how in some towns about 90% of the children are female. This is happening in parts of East Europe as well. It is due to pollution. GE was caught coating baby bottles with an estrogen mimicking chemical. There is no logical reason to do so other than population control. Usually these things aren&rsquo;t reported in mainstream news or seldom reported but occasionally might be mentioned. It&rsquo;s all verifiable and documented. </p>
<p>Bill Gates gives several speeches about the importance of population control and his main project has been the vaccine projects. He has dumped unbelievable sums of money into it. Some of his vaccines have actually made the children sick and killed them in third world areas. Each batch is different. Some of them are harmless, a lot of them have about 1/3 sterilizing chemicals and on rare occasion they seem to be contaminated and kill or wound children.</p>

In the video article I saw there was an American lab that found them and a report issued in a mainstream journal. On the google search I just saw articles about a lab in Africa that found the contaminate. Even the pope came out speaking against it, so the Catholic church apparently finds the sources reputable as well. The Gates foundation even issued a reply, admitting to contaminates, stating that they got there by accident. Similiar incidents have happened with the same hormone laced in the vaccine in south america, mexico and the phillipines as well as Africa. Combined with Bill Gate&rsquo;s statements about reducing the population through vaccines seems pretty legitimate. </p>
<p>They have already reduced births in Europe and the U.S. Whites aren&rsquo;t even replacing themselves. This has a lot to do with what is put in the food and other covert methods. If it wasn&rsquo;t for immigration the U.S. and most of Europe would be shrinking in population.</p>
