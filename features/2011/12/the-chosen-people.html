<em>The Chosen People: A study of Jewish Intelligence and Achievement</em> is the most recent work of Richard Lynn dealing with group differences in IQ and their ramifications. As in all of his previous work over the past decade, he substantiates his arguments with huge quantities of empirical data. He advances his positions dispassionately and lets the facts speak for themselves, which they do in impressive, nearly irrefutable fashion. In his previous books he examined racial and ethnic differences in IQ for many groups.<em>The Chosen People</em> is a case study of one distinct group that has shown remarkably similar patterns of achievement in a wide variety of settings.</p>
<p>Professor Lynn begins by pointing out the extraordinary success of Jews in almost every field. In the 19th century the restrictions that had prevented most Jews from advanced nonreligious study began to be lifted in most of Western Europe, and by mid-century, &ldquo;people began to observe that Jews were outstandingly successful, and began to speculate that this was attributable to their intellect.&rdquo; (Unless otherwise noted, all quotations are from Professor Lynn.)</p>
<p>At that time the great bulk of Jews were still living in Eastern Europe, but owing to pogroms beginning around 1880, Jews began migrating to Western Europe and especially to the United States. They formed part of the massive immigration to the US in the period from 1880 to 1924.</p>
<p>Prof. Lynn writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>They arrived as penniless refugees unable to speak the languages of their new countries; they were the &ldquo;huddled masses&rdquo; from the most backward region of Europe. Yet by the middle decades of the 20th century, the children and grandchildren of these immigrants were doing far better than their Gentile hosts on all indices of socioeconomic status and earnings and outperforming them by several orders of magnitude in obtaining elite academic distinction . . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>The development of IQ tests confirmed the impression that Jews were unusually intelligent, and Professor Lynn&rsquo;s extensive review of the literature indicates that Jews in the US have an average IQ of 110 compared to 100 for other Europeans. This would help account for their outstanding performance in a variety of fields. Though Jews are only about 0.2 percent of the world population, half the world&rsquo;s chess grandmasters, for example, and 16 percent of Nobel Prize winners for science have been Jews. For Professor Lynn, the purpose of his book &ldquo;is to document and explain such achievements.&rdquo; It would be a mistake to think that these are the accomplishments of all Jews, however, as they are mainly the achievements of Ashkenazi Jews, the Jews of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Professor Lynn explains that there are four major subpopulations of Jews, differentiated genetically by their different experiences following their expulsion from Israel in the first century AD. The most populous group, by far, are the Ashkenazi, who migrated to Western Europe. However, &ldquo;In the period between 1290 and 1500, Jews were extensively persecuted and expelled from Western and Central Europe . . . . Most of them migrated eastward into present-day Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Russia.&rdquo; There they remained until the mass migrations of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Those who stayed were, in the main, killed by the Nazis toward the end of World War II. Most of those who survived the war migrated to Israel and other, mainly English-speaking countries.</p>

<p>A second group, the Sephardim, migrated to the Iberian Peninsula after the Roman expulsion, where they lived, largely under Muslim rule, until 1492. Jews flourished during the early period of Muslim rule, but from about 1000, a change in Muslim leadership led to increased persecution. When Spain drove out the Muslims in 1492, it also expelled all Jews who refused to convert to Christianity. Portugal expelled its Jews in 1496. Most Iberian Jews then went to the Balkans, though others migrated to the Middle East, the Netherlands, and Italy. Prof. Lynn notes that &ldquo;their descendants in the mid-20th century numbered about two million and were widely dispersed throughout the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third Jewish group, the Mizrahim, settled in various lands in the Middle East and North Africa during various diasporas beginning about 600 BC. These lands were conquered by the Arabs in the 8th century, under whose rule Jews were tolerated but subject to various restrictions. This area was conquered in the 16th century by the Ottoman Turks, who &ldquo;provided a generally benign environment for Jews and other non-Muslims.&rdquo; That is the main reason why Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal made their way into the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>A fourth group, the Falashas, &ldquo;are Ethiopians who converted to Judaism at some uncertain time many centuries ago.&rdquo; The state of Israel recognized these genetically distinct Africans as Jews who were, therefore, entitled to take advantage of the Jewish Right of Return. Prof. Lynn writes that &ldquo;by 1998, virtually all of them had left Ethiopia and taken up residence in Israel. They numbered about 80,000 . . . [or] about 1.4 percent of the population of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the exception of the Ethiopians, the three Jewish subpopulations greatly resemble each other genetically and are distinguishable from Gentiles. Nevertheless, centuries of separation produced considerable differences among them, due in part to intermarriage with Gentiles, even in the face of strict endogamy rules.</p>
<p>The most notable difference among Jewish groups is average IQ. While the Ashkenazi average is 110, the Sephardic average is about 99, close to that of Europeans. The Mizrahim score about 91, markedly lower than Europeans, but higher than the Arabs with whom they have lived, whose average is about 84. The genetically distinct Falashas have IQs of about 70, typical of sub-Saharan people.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 586px"><img src="/ar/2011/11/05b-Falasha_Synagogue.jpg" alt="Said to be a synagogue of Falash Ethiopian Jews." width="576" height="404"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Said to be a synagogue of Falash Ethiopian Jews.</p></div>
<p>These IQ differences have had an important impact on the achievement of each group. This is especially clear in Israel, where they live side by side. The Israeli population of about 6 million people (in 2000) is about 40 percent Mizrahim, about 40 percent &ldquo;European,&rdquo; and about 20 percent Arab Muslims. Comparisons are complicated, however, because the 2.4 million characterized as European include 110,000 Sephardim. Furthermore, many in the group classified as European Jews are immigrants from Russia, a large number of whom &mdash; some Israeli demographers estimate as many as 900,000 &mdash; are not Jews at all. They are ethnic Russians &ldquo;who pretended to be Jews in order to obtain permission to leave the Soviet Union.&rdquo; For these reasons the average IQ of those classified as European Jews is estimated to be about 106, lower than would be the case if all were Ashkenazim.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on all measures of social and educational success, the Europeans do better than the Mizrahim, who in turn do better than the Arab citizens, a ranking perfectly consistent with IQ estimates. Of particular interest are the Ethiopians, who do very poorly, and behave like American blacks. According to an Israeli researcher, many &ldquo;identify with an &lsquo;aggressive and semi-criminal African-American youth culture&rsquo; and have become a &lsquo;kind of ethnic underclass.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

" width="576" height="1152"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Ship&rsquo;s manifest of immigrants, Ellis Island, 1901: those from Russia are Jews.</p></div>
<p>The largest portion of Prof. Lynn&rsquo;s book deals with the performance of Jews (mainly Ashkenazim) in just about every country in which they settled. The most striking finding is the very great similarity of Jewish achievement everywhere. Without exception, Jews outperform their non-Jewish neighbors by very large multiples. Whether in education, in professional and managerial positions, in prestigious awards, in income, and in musical and artistic fields, Jews are on average five times more successful than Gentiles.</p>
<p>In Austria, for example, Jews were not given full civil rights until 1867. Nevertheless, in the period 1873 to 1910, Jews dominated most of the professions in Vienna even though they were only 10 percent of the city&rsquo;s population. They were 40 percent of the graduates of the Gymnasium (elite high schools), 62 percent of the lawyers, 50 percent of the doctors, 57 percent of the journalists, 40 percent of the bank directors, and 70 percent of the members of the Vienna stock exchange.</p>

<p>Jews significantly outperform European Gentiles in verbal, mathematical, and analytic abilities, but do not generally exceed Europeans in visual and spatial abilities. This is reflected in the fact that Jews tend to be most successful in professions such as medicine, law and literature, but not nearly so much in architecture, engineering and sculpture. They do outperform Europeans in these fields, but to a lesser degree, and probably by applying their general intelligence to maximize performance. It is interesting that the success of Jewish artists in the modern era has coincided with the rise of conceptual, nonrepresentational art; they were especially prominent in the Abstract Expressionist movement.</p>
<p>The United States contains the largest number of Jews outside of Israel. By the end of the massive immigration period of 1880 to 1924, there were about 4.2 million Jews in the US and they represented 3.5 percent of the population. Today they number 5.7 million, but represent only about two percent of the population because other groups have grown more quickly.</p>

<p>Most immigrants could not speak English, but even as early as 1908 they represented 7 percent of the students at Ivy League universities, a number that had grown by 1919 to 13 percent at Yale, 20 percent at Harvard and Brown, 25 percent at the University of Pennsylvania, and fully 40 percent at Columbia. They made up 90 percent of the students at City College and Hunter College in New York City. In the following decades, efforts to limit Jewish enrollment kept percentages fairly constant in the Ivy League.</p>
<p>Jews are overrepresented in high-status occupations. In 1945, 53 percent of Jews held professional and managerial positions compared to 19 percent of the total population. By 2000, the figures were 68 percent versus 35 percent. Jewish women have an almost identical occupational profile, with 51.4 percent in the professions and 16 percent in management.</p>
<p>In law and medicine, Jews are overrepresented by a factor of about five. While Jews are somewhat underrepresented in college teaching, they are heavily overrepresented on elite university faculties, by factors of 7.4 in mathematics to 13.3 in law. Sixty-two of the 200 American Nobel Prize winners have been Jewish, and Jews were six of the 16 winners of the prestigious Fields Medal and the Wolf Prize in mathematics. Jews have also taken 52 percent of the Pulitzer Prizes for nonfiction.</p>
<p>The Jewish presence in entertainment is well known. Professor Lynn notes that &ldquo;from the 1920s on, Jews have dominated American music in three areas: popular songs, musicals and classical. In the golden age of Tin Pan Alley (1920-1960), about half the leading songwriters were Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Hollywood, Jews founded the most prominent film companies, and still dominate the industry. Professor Lynn quotes movie critic Michael Medved: &ldquo;Any list of the most influential production executives at each of the major movie studios will produce a heavy majority of recognizably Jewish names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the most famous movie stars were Jews who took non-Jewish-sounding names, such as Douglas Fairbanks, Danny Kaye, Tony Curtis, Hedy Lamar, Judy Holiday and Judy Garland, to name just a few. More recently, figures such as Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, and Steven Spielberg made no effort to conceal their Jewish origins. Prof. Lynn notes that in 1990, <em>American Film</em> magazine reported that the CEOs of eight of these top ten entertainment companies were Jewish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jews have been prominent among the owners and executives of American TV, radio and newspapers.&rdquo; Of the major networks, CBS, NBC, and ABC, all were controlled by Jews at one time or another. CBS was founded by William Paley, who is Jewish, and has remained under the control of Jewish chairmen to this day. David Sarnoff, also Jewish, ran NBC from 1930 to 1970, when control was passed to his son, Robert. In 1986, the network was taken over by the General Electric Corporation.</p>
<p>ABC was acquired by the Walt Disney Company in 1996, at the time run by Michael Eisner and now headed by Robert Iger, both of whom are Jews. Two of the most prestigious and influential newspapers, &ldquo;the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em>, have been owned and largely staffed by Jews.&rdquo; Professor Lynn remarks that &ldquo;the Sulzberger family still controls the <em>Times</em> and also owns 33 other newspapers, including the <em>Boston Globe</em> . . . [and] 12 magazines . . . with a circulation of more than five million each; seven radio and TV broadcasting stations; a cable-TV system; and three book publishing companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having established with extraordinary diligence the success of Ashkenazi Jews, Professor Lynn addresses the question of the origins of these Jews&rsquo; high intelligence. He dismisses environmental explanations on a number of grounds. He points out that &ldquo;the four Jewish peoples in Israel occupy a similar environment, with the same access to healthcare and education, but the intelligence differences between them are pronounced.&rdquo; The oft-expressed explanation that the Jewish emphasis on education explains higher IQ is easily dismissed since Jewish children get high scores even before entering school. The role of &ldquo;pushy Jewish mothers&rdquo; can be dismissed because many studies have found that &ldquo;family environmental factors have no long-term effect on the intelligence of children.&rdquo; One is left with genetic explanations.In addition, &ldquo;the three largest circulation news magazines &mdash; <em>Time</em>, <em>Newsweek</em>, and <em>US News and World Report</em> &mdash; are largely owned and run by Jews.&rdquo; Whether Jews <em>control</em> the media is a contentious issue; it is indisputable, however, that they have an influence in the media hugely disproportionate to their numbers in the population.</p>
<p>Based on historical evidence, Prof. Lynn assumes that before migrating out of the Middle East, Jews probably had IQs similar to those of other Semitic peoples of the region, which today is about 84. This means that between that time and the present, Ashkenazi intelligence had to grow by 26 points. This works out to an increase of 1.25 per century and 0.3 points per generation. Genetic changes of this size are very unlikely to occur by chance, and evolutionary factors must have played a part. Selective pressures in the 2000 or so years since the Jews migrated into Europe must have produced this large gain in intelligence. However, as Prof. Lynn notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are three problems that require explanation. First, what has brought about these different IQs of the Ashkenazim, the Sephardim, and the Mizrahim? Second, why have these three subpopulations of Jews developed higher IQs than the Gentiles among whom they have lived? Third, why have the Ashkenazim acquired their pattern of high verbal, mathematical, and reasoning abilities but weaker visual and spatial abilities?</p></blockquote>
<p>One prominent theory is that Jewish practices and customs had a eugenic effect. This position is taken by Kevin MacDonald in his book, <em>A People That Shall Dwell Alone</em>. Perhaps the most important of these customs was the high status accorded to religious scholars, which meant that wealthy men encouraged their daughters to marry scholars and their sons to marry the daughters of scholars. &ldquo;These &lsquo;eugenic marriages&rsquo; brought wealth and intelligence together and normally produced relatively large numbers of surviving children,&rdquo; since wealth conferred an advantage against disease and privation.</p>
<p>Another eugenic practice &mdash; this one externally imposed &mdash; may have been the measures taken in Austria and Germany in the 18th century to limit the growth of the Jewish population: quotas on Jewish marriages, special marriage taxes and licenses for Jews, allowing only first-born sons to marry, etc. In such circumstances, the least influential Jews, those with little wealth or scholarship, often had to postpone marriage or forgo it completely.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 334px"><img src="/ar/2011/11/08b-Jewish_Money_Lender.jpg" alt="Jewish money lender." width="324" height="406"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Jewish money lender.</p></div>
<p>A third factor suggested by Prof. MacDonald is that men, in particular, who failed to gain prestige through scholarship, may have been more inclined to leave the faith than those who were more successful. This is also the opinion of Charles Murray as put forth in his <em>Commentary</em> article, &ldquo;Jewish Genius.&rdquo; These eugenic practices would also help explain the IQ profile of the Ashkenazim, since the study of sacred texts required a high verbal IQ but not necessarily a high visual-spatial IQ.</p>
<p>The main problem with this theory, according to Professor Lynn, is that these practices were also common among the Sephardim and Mizrahim, and cannot explain the considerably higher IQ of the Ashkenazim. It would explain, however, how Jews from all three groups achieved higher IQs than their host populations. A somewhat related explanation is that the slaughter of Jews throughout European history may have been inadvertently eugenic, in that the wealthier and more intelligent Jews could escape to safer locales or avoid being killed by paying ransom. While there is little evidence for this, it is not implausible and would explain the lower IQs of the Sephardim and Mizrahim, who were not massacred to the same extent as the Ashkenazim.</p>
<p>Gregory Cochran, Jason Hardy, and Henry Harpending have proposed a second explanation in their paper, <em>The Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence</em>. They argue that around the 13th century, European Jews were restricted to only a few trades. This was largely because of their exclusion, for religious reasons, from the guilds that dominated Europe&rsquo;s economy. &ldquo;Jews were allowed to be money-lenders, to open banks and charge interest on loans, which were prohibited for Christians, to work as tax collectors and import-export merchants, and to deal in second-hand goods as peddlers.&rdquo; In most of these occupations, with the exception of peddlers, &ldquo;Jews would have needed strong verbal, mathematical and reasoning abilities to assess risk and make calculations.&rdquo; And since such occupations allowed for a better standard of living, those who engaged in them were more likely to assure the survival of their offspring and the passing on of genes that promote such abilities. This might explain the Ashkenazim&rsquo;s unique IQ profile since, unlike the Christian craftsmen, they would not have needed such strong visual and spatial abilities.</p>
<p>This theory is supported by the fact that Ashkenazi Jews suffer from a number of genetic disorders produced by genes that may have a positive effect on intelligence. These genes would probably have been eliminated from the gene pool if they had not conferred some significant advantage. These genes, furthermore, are not common among Europeans or among Sephardic or Mizrahi Jews. This theory can also account for the Ashkenazim-Mizrahim difference, since the Jews living under Islam were not, according to Prof. Cochran and his colleagues, concentrated in intellectually demanding jobs, but were often relegated to &ldquo;disagreeable or despised occupations.&rdquo; All of these explanations are highly speculative, but rapid advances in genetic research could bring greater certainty.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="/ar/2011/11/09a-Tay-Sachs.jpg" alt="." width="576" height="346"/></p>
<p>Professor Lynn points out that while the high IQ of the Ashkenazi Jews can explain Jewish success, it cannot fully explain the extent of that success. Given the IQ difference between Jews and Gentiles, we would expect that Jews would be twice as likely as Gentiles to have IQs in excess of 115, which is the minimum required to become, for instance, a physician or lawyer. However, Jewish participation in medicine and law is more than four times greater than would be predicted by IQ alone.</p>
<p>In general, Jews do not differ in any appreciable way from Gentiles in the things they value, with one exception: They have a greater desire to achieve economic and social success, that is to say, they are high in &ldquo;achievement motivation.&rdquo; Professor Lynn suggests that, like many personality variables, this may have a partly genetic basis &ldquo;brought about through having been selected by eugenic customs, persecution, and discrimination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this book, Professor Lynn has more than accomplished his goal of documenting and explaining the extraordinary accomplishments of Jews in modern societies. Nevertheless, I suspect many readers will be disappointed that Prof. Lynn does not address the many contentious issues raised by the influence of Jews on modern Western culture. Professor Lynn chose not to write such a book. What he has done is provide a powerfully argued, thoroughly scientific analysis that can be relied upon as a sound resource by those who do wish to address these vexing issues.</p>

I am confident that this is either not true, due to testing error, or due to the fact that the tests were in their infancy, and relied too much on a expert knowledge of English, which many Jewish recruits, being products of recent immigration, did not have. <br/>
 <br/>
This presumed &#8220;fact&#8221; has been used against books like &#8220;The Bell Curve,&#8221; so I would like for it to be explained.  </p>

Another example is the immigration  policies of  Europe and the Anglosphere. Example- When the Front National or other similar groups  attempted to change the immigration policies of France they were tagged as an &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; hate groups by Jewish pressure groups. The result is now a huge Muslim population in France. Don&rsquo;t ask me why formerly Christian European countries becoming Muslim is &#8220;good for the Jews&#8221;  they have to live there too.</p>

Cultural and social insularity benefits EVERY race, yet, whites are generally looked askance if they attempt to promote it among ourselves.  It is OK for blacks, asians, hispanics and others to promote their own cultural and social insularity; let a white individual (or group) do the same and we are viciously attacked for being &#8220;racist&#8221; not only by organizations but government.<br/>
Whites are generally loath to act, even in the face of hostility.  It may take quite some time for &#8220;push&#8221; to come to &#8220;shove&#8221; but it will happen.  It may not be pretty, but it will become necessary. <br/>
I bear no ill will towards any race, group or individual, but am merely pointing out that the present situation does not look good.  Remember, those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it.</p>

I doubt, however, that attendance ratios of Jews to non-Jews at elite universities are 1:1 or even close to it.  I say this not based on any specific knowledge, but simply my own observations.  Most of our friends are goyim, many of whom have had kids attend Ivy League schools.  We are close friends with two Jewish couples, neither of whose kids went to Ivy League schools, and one of which is quite fabulously wealthy.  My daughter just finished pre-med at Penn, very much a top-flight Ivy League school. While I never queried her on apparently Jewish students, her comments always related to the huge numbers of Asian students in her classes, mostly from China, Taiwan, and India. Disturbingly, these kids used to fulfill a life-long dream of their parents to emigrate to the US and become citizens; now most of them want to return home after they finish medical school, given the rapidly exploding GDPs and standards of living in their home nations.  Clearly, this doesn&rsquo;t bode well for the American medical system in the future.  Fortunately for me, I&rsquo;m rather deep into old farthood so lack of care probably won&rsquo;t be a factor.  But I worry about my kids.<br/>

According to historian David  Oshinsky.  &#8221;Most of the surrounding medical<br/>
schools &mdash; Cornell, Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Yale  &mdash; had rigid quotas in place. In 1935 Yale accepted 76 applicants from a pool of 501.<br/>
About 200 of those applicants were Jewish and only five got in.&#8221; He notes that<br/>
the dean&rsquo;s instructions were remarkably precise: &#8220;Never admit more than five<br/>
Jews.&#8221;http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Jewish_quota</p>

I also earned an MBA degree from Stern - New York University rated (in the late 1980s) the #1 MBA program in America by US News and World Report&hellip; I did not get a job after graduation and was never offered a senior management position in any Hollywood Studio, at Goldman Sachs or the Federal Reserve Bank, so I&rsquo;m not completely sold on the idea that American success is all about intelligence and academic merit.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I am not an anti Semitic Jew hater, I am however aware of racial/ethnic realities.</p>
<p>Birds of a feather flock together.<br/>
Blood is thicker than water.<br/>
The Jews are like all people, only more so.</p>
<p>Just as Blacks close ranks and vote &#8220;Black&#8221; - over 95% for Barack Obama, most Jews do the same.  Jews are ~ 2% of the US population, though ~ 33% of the US Supreme Court. There are currently more Jewish lesbians from New York City on the US Supreme Court than there are White Gentiles of British heritage on the Supreme Court. For those who might argue that the Jewish success in making it to the Supreme court is based on superior Jewish intellect and a merit system that rewards the best people to be promoted in their field. I note that US Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan was never even a judge at any level before she was nominated to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>That said, I strongly urge American Renaissance readers not to go down the anti Semite Jew hating road, it&rsquo;s a dead end. Try to live a positive, White life, separate from all that is corrupt and anti White (get rid of your TV). If you have any personal problems with individual Jewish people, contact a Jewish friend who will address the issue for you. Whenever any White Gentile criticizes a Jewish person, or worse criticizes &#8220;THE JEWS&#8221;, Jewish Americans close ranks and scream &#8220;NAZI&#8221;, &#8220;RACIST&#8221;, &#8220;HATER&#8221;. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the Jewish person is very guilty, harmful - like Roman Polanski, the Jewish movie director who drugged and raped a 12 year old girl. The Jewish community closes ranks and protects their tribe.</p>
<p>In areas like immigration, the American Jewish community is going to be overwhelmingly on the other side - that&rsquo;s life. Try to fight for our side without hating other people on the other side. Be firm but fair with all people, including Jewish people and take great joy and befriending honest, decent Jewish people who really are on our side. There are many such good Jewish people here.</p>
<p>And if you are starting to fall down in to anti Semitic Jew hated, paranoia - go spend some time in an Arab/Pakistani Muslim neighborhood, country. Anybody trying to hang out and drink beers with Al Qaeda/Taliban Muslims is an idiot.<br/>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-59685" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I too have noticed the ethnic awareness and cohesion Jews possess.  It is an undeniable truth that many Jews in the US and in Europe have made beneficial contributions in the fields of science, medicine, and the arts.  However, they tend to be overwhelming liberal and increasingly secular, insanely distrustful of their natural ally Evangelical Christians, and prone to a less than righteous set of ethics-one independent of what the Torah teaches.</p>
<p>Anecdotely, the issue of Jewish cohesion is readily observable, and an excellent answer to the overrepresentation of Jews in the softer fields such as entertainment.  Are movies funnier, better produced, or better written because of Hollywood&rsquo;s Jewish influence?  I doubt it.  But they are certainly more crass, secular, and culturally debasive than they would be if Hollywood was run by whites of Irish, German, Italian, French, English, Dutch, and Nordic descent.  Mel Gibson&rsquo;s drunken rant makes more sense in the context of Jewish behavior seen today, although this isn&rsquo;t to excuse it.</p>
<p>In my days as an undergrad, I was taking a communications class.  The teacher had us divide into 3 groups to argue a proposition; one group argued for the affirmative, one the negative, and the third would be the jury to decide the winner.  The issue was something irrelevant I am sure, but as a fairly competitive and argumentative person I wanted to present the winning case.  After the debate, I felt confident my side made a much better (and coherent) point.  However, when it came time to decide the jury (led by an obviously Jewish student) ruled for the other team who had a Jewish student, before adding &#8220;l&rsquo;chaim&#8221; and smiling at his fellow tribesman.  This incident has only led to my further ethno-cultural awareness and about tribalism.  </p>
<p>I am pro-Israel, and these sorts of incidents and evidences convince me that Jews have a cultural identity that is different from the Gentiles.  This isn&rsquo;t to say Jews have been a negative to American society, they have brought with them much more economic benefits than other minority groups, but to argue for the continuation and repatriation of Jews who wish to live in Israel.</p>
<p>One cannot be anti-Jew and anti-Israel.  Either the Jews are a negative effect in the US and should go to Israel or Israel is an apartheid regime that tortures poor Palestinians thus Jews should never have been allowed to self-govern due to some inherrent evil they possess.  I am of course being facetious about the latter hypothesis, but the point remains the Jewish people are a unique group that is oftentimes alien to the traditional American culture I possess and wish to conserve.</p>

hundreds of articles about Jews and Judaism. As one would expect, they cover<br/>
just about every important aspect of the topic. But there is a lacuna, and not<br/>
one involving some obscure bit of Judaica. COMMENTARY has never published a<br/>
systematic discussion of one of the most obvious topics of all: the extravagant<br/>
overrepresentation of Jews, relative to their numbers, in the top ranks of the<br/>
arts, sciences, law, medicine, finance, entrepreneurship, and the media. <br/>
                  </p>
<p>I have personal experience with the reluctance of Jews to talk about Jewish<br/>
accomplishment &mdash; my co-author, the late Richard Herrnstein, gently resisted the<br/>
paragraphs on Jewish IQ that I insisted on putting in The Bell Curve (1994). Both<br/>
history and the contemporary revival of anti-Semitism in Europe make it easy to<br/>
understand the reasons for that reluctance. But Jewish accomplishment<br/>
constitutes a fascinating and important story. Recent scholarship is expanding<br/>
our understanding of its origins&hellip;<br/>
 <br/>
 Insofar as I am suggesting that the Jews may have had some degree of unusual<br/>
verbal skills going back to the time of Moses, I am naked before the<br/>
evolutionary psychologists&rsquo; ultimate challenge. Why should one particular tribe<br/>
at the time of Moses, living in the same environment as other nomadic and<br/>
agricultural peoples of the Middle East, have already evolved elevated<br/>
intelligence when the others did not?          <br/>
At this point, I take sanctuary in my remaining hypothesis, uniquely<br/>
parsimonious and happily irrefutable. The Jews are God&rsquo;s chosen people. - Charles Murrayhttp://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/jewish-genius/</p>

 <br/>
In &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution,&#8221; Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending attribute the high IQs of the Ashkenazic Jews to the persecution they experienced in Europe from the fall of the Roman Empire to the Eighteenth Century Enlightenment and the French Revolution. <br/>
 <br/>
During this time Jews were not allowed to own land. They were excluded from most trades. The only way most of them could earn a living was as merchants and money lenders. These fields require superior intelligence, so Jews who could not master the necessary skills either did not have children who survived and reproduced, or they left the faith. <br/>
 <br/>
Because Jews in Islamic countries faced less discrimination, intellectual differences between them and Muslims are less pronounced. <br/>

 &#8221;  they are &#8216;over represented&rsquo; in higher education, but that is due to historical and cultural reasons. In the early 20th century Jews were an immigrant group eager to succeed and assimilate. Like Asian parents of today, Jewish parents then pretty much demanded their children go into high paying careers like Doctor, Lawyer, Accountant etc&#8221;</p>
<p>Please note that Jews were permamently over represented in those professions in any european country they lived in larger numbers; Austria, Poland, Germany, Russia and many others. And they were not  immigrants there. Situation in Austria is described in article above.  In any country they live they tend to dominate economic, political and cultural life. Jews were the driving force behind communist revolution of 1917 in Russia. If you do some research on it, you will find that they were very over represented among Soviet communist apparatus ( Trotsky, Kaganovich ect&hellip;). Jews created Soviet state so they could dominate it. They were behind manufacturing Ukrainian famine of early 30&#8242;s where millions of Ukrainian peasents died because they resisted collectivisation efforts of Soviet state. Huge majority of russian Jews were not involved in any politics so it is hard to blame them for anything. Today in America, most Jews are not involved in politics either. But many are, and they have strong grip over it. I&rsquo;m not an American but I think that Americans should be concern about it. Why is it that PC crowd complains all the time about white over representations and nobody says anything about jewish over representation which is huge relative to actual number of Jews in America. Also Jews suppress any debate on Jewish role in history ( esp. WW2) calling it instantly anti-semitic.    </p>

<p>Even though this book supposedly praises Jewish intelligence, the title and subject plays to classic anti Semitic themes - the idea that Jews are a completely separate race of super smart, conniving Jews.</p>
<p>The title of the book &#8220;the Chosen People&#8221; will naturally cause a negative reaction from White Gentiles ie:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, so the Jews say they&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s Chosen People&#8221;  - what does that make us - dumb goyim? chopped liver? Slaves to serve Israel? If the Jews are so great, how come everybody hates them? &#8221;</p>
<p>Plus the portraits of infamous Jews like Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud are not going to win a lot of kindness and tolerance from White Gentiles who view the founder of Communism and psychoanalysis with hatred.</p>

Jews are prominent in fields that require superior intelligence. They do not dominate Hollywood, Wall Street, journalism, the academy, and so on. They are noticeable in these fields.  Jews earn their prominence by hard work and superior intelligence. </p>

<p>Jackellis replies:</p>
<p>John&hellip;.. the Jews dominate Hollywood, they have always have dominated Hollywood. Some of the Jewish founders of Hollywood weren&rsquo;t bad guys - men like Louis B Mayer loved America and their movies reflected this love. MGM movies from the 30s, 40s and most of the 50s were mostly, very positive. Hollywood used to produce Westerns, where straight White cowboys were the good guys. Check out some of Danny Kaye movies - like the Secret Life of Walter Mitty, great movies. But this all changed in the 1960s, same with television. Jewish men like Norman Lear despised White America and their TV and movies reflect this hatred.</p>
<p>And sure, it&rsquo;s &#8220;RACIST&#8221; to point out the obvious fact that Jews dominate Hollywood, dominate the American media from the New York Times, Washington Post to Time Warner Communication. CNN used to be owned, run by the White Southern gentile Ted Turner - then Turner Broadcasting merged with Time Warner Communication headed by Gerald Levin - look at CNN now - anti White propaganda, Obama cheer leading.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t want people here to start hating regular Jewish people, or blame THE JEWS for all our racial problems. But, it&rsquo;s just reality to recognize Jewish domination of the US media - same as it&rsquo;s just recognizing racial realities to see that Detroit and Zimbabwe are very Black and are not nice places for White people to live once the Blacks took completely over.</p>
<p>Do the Jews dominate the US media? Are there Chinese people in China? Are there Arab Muslims in Saudi Arabia? Yes to all 3 questions. That&rsquo;s racial/ethnic/tribal reality.</p>
<p>For those who are still in the dark on this subject please check out discussion of this subject from honest Jewish sources, such as the Jewcy interview of John Derbyshire.</p>

<p>http://isteve.blogspot.com/2008/12/joel-stein-asks-how-jewish-is-Hollywoodwood.html</p>
<p>And again, I strongly urge all Amren readers not to fall down in to anti Semitic Jew hating, blaming THE JEWS for all our racial problems. The problems of White people are caused mostly by other White (Gentile) people - selfish agribusiness owners who flood the US with NW cheap labor. White Gentiles dividing up over trivial differences like church affiliation, regional location, White vs White wars from 400 years ago, class divisions.  If we White Gentiles had even 1/10th as much racial loyalty as Jewish people we would never have had horrors like the US Civil War, World War I, post 1965 immigration disasters.</p>

<p>To the extent that there is a lot of American support for Israel, it is not coming from American Jews, it&rsquo;s coming from fundagelical millenarian Christians.  Most Jews don&rsquo;t much care about Israel, of those that do, more are anti than pro.  Honestly, most Christians really aren&rsquo;t &#8220;pro-Israel&#8221; (meaningless phrase) either; it only seems that way because the fundagelical millenarianists dominate Christian media.</p>

IQ among schizoids and outright schizophrenics-although a parsimonious assumption would be for any particular indivual  that the overlap is not a manifestation of mental disorder/imbalance.  Racial folklore<br/>
does typify Jews as more emotionally labile and more emotionally coarse  than is the general white<br/>
population.   It would seem in works like this, one can keep &#8220;within the fence&#8221; a tidy garden of scientific standards for acknowledging information, while at the same time permitting for climbing over the<br/>
fence to look at loose speculative strands. that may have heuristic value.   In a sense it is a distinction<br/>
between imposing scientific relevance upon a topic and simply serving scientific relevance by acknowledging what might yet become  relevant but is not yet clearly so.  </p>

They were 40 percent of the graduates of the Gymnasium (elite high schools), 62 percent of the lawyers, 50 percent of the doctors, 57 percent of the journalists, 40 percent of the bank directors, and 70 percent of the members of the Vienna stock exchange.         </p>
<p>-  Byron M. Roth, American Renaissance, November 2011       </p>
<p>Mein Kampf is about one third autobiography. In it Adolf Hitler reveals that while he was growing up he was sympathetic to Jews because they were persecuted, and that he only began to hate them after he had moved to Vienna and failed in his efforts to become an architect and an artist. This passage explains why he hated them.  Antisemitism is the socialism of the gutter. It combines the leftist politics of envy with right wing racial bigotry.</p>

Why do they keep banging on about the holocaust when the US army stated that 1.5 million jews died not 6 million like jewish organisations state. The irish dont bang on about the potato famine, Americans about the US civil war, the British about WW1. Yet 50 million people died in WW2 and all we here about is the jews and the holocaust an insult to every other people who had people die.<br/>
Why did the jews come to America when they have a communist bent ably exposed by Eugene Mccarthy, they ruined Russia yet claim persecution yet 10 0f the 11 richest oligarchs are jewish stealing the russian people assets and transferring them overseas.<br/>
Most inventions and discoveries are by white european christians, - Tesla the greatest physicist, electrical engineer and genius ever to live exposed Einstein as lifting chapter and verse out of a book from another Serb genius and passing it of as his own work.<br/>
Why should America sacrifice its young and pay Israel a fortune in US taxes when it sits on a land stole of other people.<br/>
The jews could have assimilated into western society but chose to be the communists and the bankers, the oligarchs and minipulators - history will cast them a bad hand in the future.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-60666" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thank you for your insightful comments.  You are correct about intermarriage between jews and gentiles.  If you look at jewish publications you will find that intermarriage is still frowned upon and is actively discouraged. <br/>
I don&rsquo;t blame any other race or culture for the &#8220;foibles&#8221; of whites.  To do so is short-sighted and counterproductive.<br/>
That being said, how do you explain the &#8220;war on Christianity&#8221; going on in our court systems?  You will see Nativity scenes being banned while jewish and muslim artifact displays are conveniently ignored and free from litigation.<br/>
It is obvious that the ADL and JDF are jewish organizations, ostensibly set up for the beterment of their ?race? ?religion? ?culture?  which is it??  They seem to get involved in much of the litigation involving Christian symbols in public places.<br/>
The $PLC, ACLU and NAACP were all founded by jews.  These three organizations (and others) are responsible for the hostility (and loss of rights) that whites endure in our country.<br/>
Look up &#8220;who&rsquo;s who&#8221; in the government foreign policy sector and see how many hold &#8220;dual nationality&#8221; citizenship.   (I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to find out which country is overrepresented and influential in &#8220;guiding US foreign affairs to their advantage and NOT what is good for America). <br/>
It is interesting to note that there are probably MORE Christians who blindly follow Israeli policies and politics (dispensationalists) and see jews as the &#8220;chosen people&#8221; (I don&rsquo;t) than there are of Americans of the jewish faith.  Note that there is MORE political plurality in Israel than is evident in the USA.<br/>
DO NOT blame all jews for the actions of few of their brethren.  Most jews (as well as other races and cultures) are good people and just want to live decent lives . . .<br/>
I trust that the above will not be taken out of context. <br/>
I hold NO hatred towards anyone, but am merely stating the way things are.<br/>
Don&rsquo;t take my word for it.  Research these things.  Look them up for yourselves. . . . Be a seeker of TRUTH.<br/>
I welcome comments and criticisms.  If anything that I have said above is incorrect, please feel free to comment.<br/>
I await intelligent responses . . .</p>
