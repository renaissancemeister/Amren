	                	<p>In mid-March, the Department of Education <a href="../../../Downloads/CMOCRTheTransformedCRDCFINAL3-15-12Accessible-1.pdf">reported</a> that black and Hispanic students are suspended from school at higher rates than whites. This has been known for years, but every time it is reported there is outrage. Education Secretary Arne Duncan worried about the &ldquo;the most alarming findings.&rdquo; He lamented that &ldquo;minority students across America face much harsher discipline than non-minorities, even within the same school,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/education/black-students-face-more-harsh-discipline-data-shows.html">adding</a> that &ldquo;the everyday education experience for too many students of color violates the principle of equity at the heart of the American promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary did warn that &ldquo;overt discrimination&rdquo; might not fully account for these differences, but others were not so cautious. The National Education Policy Center at the University of Boulder <a href="http://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/discipline-policies">announced</a> that &ldquo;researchers have found no evidence that students of color engage in more misbehavior than White students,&rdquo; which leaves discrimination as the only culprit. Judith Browne Dianis, co-director of a minority-oriented organization called the Advancement Project, explained that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s bias in classrooms.&rdquo; She added that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s also this perception of children of color as being criminals.&rdquo; The Chicago Teachers Union responded to the report by saying that &ldquo;the data lends further credibility&rdquo; to its belief that school practices &ldquo;amount to educational apartheid for a significant number of students.&rdquo; The media appeared to quote no one who pointed out that racial differences in suspension rates might simply reflect differences in offense rates.</p>
<p>The Department of Education&rsquo;s study, unaccountably titled &ldquo;Revealing New Truths About Our Nation&rsquo;s Schools,&rdquo; presented the data graphically:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-1a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99594" title="Graphic-1a" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-1a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="365"/></a></p>
<p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="../../../Downloads/CMOCRTheTransformedCRDCFINAL3-15-12Accessible-1.pdf">Source</a></p>
</div>
<p>Black boys are indeed, suspended at about three times the rate for white boys, and black girls at nearly four times the white rate. However, every account of these findings ignored the fact that, as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/11/california-school-suspensions_n_1417951.html">study</a> after <a href="http://www.minnpost.com/learning-curve/2011/10/black-students-suspension-rate-mps-far-higher-others">study</a> has shown, Asians are suspended <em>less</em> often than whites. If it is &ldquo;alarming&rdquo; that black boys are suspended at three times the rate for white boys, why is it not &ldquo;alarming&rdquo; that white girls are suspended at three times Asian rate?</p>
<p>Boys are at least twice as likely to be suspended as girls, but no one talks about that either. Everyone knows that boys behave worse than girls, but to acknowledge sex differences in behavior might suggest the possibility of race differences. Correction: <em>Almost</em> everyone understands this. The Southern Poverty Law Center <a href="../../../sites/default/files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf">worried</a> that the data &ldquo;raise important questions about . . . the possibility of conscious or unconscious racial and <em>gender</em> biases at the school level.&rdquo; (emphasis added)</p>
<p>Just a few weeks after its report on suspension rates, the Department of Education issued a joint report with the Department of Justice called <em>Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011</em>. It got a bit of <a href="/news/2012/04/1183700-violent-crimes-committed-at-public-schools-only-303900-reported-to-police.html">press attention</a>, too, mainly for pointing out that although there were more than 1,000,000 violent crimes committed at American public schools, only about 300,000 are reported to the police.</p>
<p>What went unremarked were the race data in the report, which flatly contradict the view that there are no race differences in levels of misbehavior at school. Secretary Arne Duncan, who expressed such alarm over suspension rates, ignored the race data. You have to dig for the information, and it is <em>not</em> presented in pretty bar graphs like the suspension rates, but the picture is clear.</p>
<p>Table 7.1, for example, deserves serious study (click on the figure to see an enlarged version).</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99586" title="Graphic 2" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-2.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="257"/></a></p>

<p>This table is the result of polling teachers about the problems they have in their schools. The schools are in four categories, according to the number of students who are non-white. Translated into terms that make more sense, the top row schools are at least 95 percent white. The second row schools are 80 to 95 percent whites, the third row are 50 to 80 percent white, and the fourth row are less than 50 percent white. The numbers in the rows are the percentages of these schools that have the kinds of problems described along the top horizontal axis. The ‡ and ! symbols mean that the reported numbers are so low they are meaningless or that sample sizes are unreliable.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice is that aside from sexual and sexual-orientation harassment and bullying, every category gets consistently worse as a school gets less white. To take the first category &mdash; racial or ethnic tensions &mdash; schools that are 95 percent or more white essentially do not suffer from that problem at all. Not surprisingly, racially mixed campuses do. No less than 4.5 percent of majority non-white schools have racial/ethnic problems <em>at least once a week.</em></p>
<p>There are similar patterns with &ldquo;student verbal abuse of teachers&rdquo; and &ldquo;widespread disorder in the classroom.&rdquo; There are essentially no all-white schools where this happens as often as once a week, but the percentages grow as the student body gets less white. Schools with a lot of &ldquo;verbal abuse of teachers&rdquo; and &ldquo;widespread disorder in the classroom&rdquo; sound like schools where suspensions might be more common.</p>
<p>The report does not explain what is meant by &ldquo;student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse,&rdquo; but it undoubtedly includes behavior &mdash; hitting a teacher, for example? &mdash; that merits suspension. The less white the school, the more of this there is. &ldquo;Gang activities&rdquo; &mdash; and might these not also require firm discipline? &mdash; are no less than 19 times more common in white-minority schools than in schools that are all- or nearly all-white. This table by itself gives the lie to the notion that all races behave in the same way.</p>
<p>And even the categories of offence that appear to be as common in white schools as in non-white schools may not be. Is it unreasonable to assume that what is flagged as bullying or sexual harassment in an all-white school with very few behavior problems is simply overlooked in a majority non-white school with gang activity and &ldquo;widespread disorder in the classroom&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Table 6.5 contains eye-opening information, too.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99587" title="Graphic 3" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-3.jpg" alt="" width="607" height="168"/></a></p>

<p>The &ldquo;serious violent incidents&rdquo; in this table are the real thing: rape, robbery, and actual or threatened attack with a weapon. There are some deviations from perfect correlation, but the trend is clear: White schools have fewer serious violent incidents (the # sign means &ldquo;rounds to zero). If there is anything that deserves suspension, it is surely violent crime, and violent crime increases as the number of non-whites increases.</p>
<p>Figure 13.2 shows who is fighting in schools. This is one of the rare visual representations of race-related data in this report, and the findings are consistent with suspension patterns: Blacks fight more than Hispanics, who fight more than whites, who fight more than Asians.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99588" title="Graphic 4" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-4.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="274"/></a></p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Source</p>
</div>
<p>Table 13.2 goes into more detail on fighting. Blacks are twice as likely as whites, for example, to have been in four to 11, or 12 or more fights in the past year.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99589" title="Graphic 5" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-5.jpg" alt="" width="617" height="185"/></a></p>

<p>The other government department &mdash; the Department of Justice &mdash; that helped write <em>Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011</em> has useful information, too.  If there are no racial differences in misbehavior rates in school, there should be no racial differences in juvenile arrest rates. DOJ data prove otherwise.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99590" title="Graphic 6" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Graphic-6.jpg" alt="" width="627" height="346"/></a></p>

</div>
<p>Again, these are juvenile arrest rates for the very worst offenses: murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. In its usual, unhelpful way, DOJ lumps most Hispanics together with whites rather than break them out as a separate group, thus inflating white offense rate. This means the black/white gap is even <em>greater</em> than what is depicted here. Even with Hispanics included with whites, in 2009, black juveniles between the ages of 10 and 17 were four times more likely than white juveniles to be arrested for serious, violent crime.</p>
<p>There are still a few people who believe that arrest rates do not reflect offense rates; that prejudiced cops arrest innocent blacks. Such people forget that violent crimes short of murder usually have witnesses, and that the police arrest perpetrators who match victims&rsquo; descriptions. For police bias to cause race gaps of this magnitude, we would have to imagine the police arresting blacks even when the victim said the attacker was white, or refusing even to look for the perp if the victim said he was white. This is absurd.</p>
<p>DOJ has data on race differences in arrest rates for other crimes. The gaps for murder and robbery, for example, are particularly large.</p>

<p>The data on juvenile arrests for disorderly conduct includes Asians and Americans Indians. They bear out the consistent pattern of very low Asian offense rates.</p>

<p>It would be wrong to assume that blacks top the arrest rates for all crimes. As this chart shows, young whites and Indians are arrested far more often than blacks for breaking liquor laws.</p>

<p>Race differences in rates of arrest for drinking offenses further discredit the notion that &ldquo;racist&rdquo; police unfairly target blacks. Public or under-age drinking is an offense for which the police have enormous leeway on whether to make an arrest. Unlike the pressure on police to arrest violent criminals, the public does not much care whether there are arrests of under-age drinkers. That means liquor-law violations would be a perfect opportunity to exercise police &ldquo;racism:&rdquo; Arrest the blacks and ignore the whites. Instead, whites (and Indians) are arrested more often for these offenses because they commit more of them than blacks or Asians. DOJ&rsquo;s arrest rates confirm reports from schools: Different groups behave differently.</p>
<p>Readers will recall that the National Education Policy Center at the University of Boulder claims that there is &ldquo;<a href="http://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/discipline-policies">no evidence</a>&rdquo; that blacks commit crimes at higher rates that whites. Daniel J. Losen, who made that claim, is either a fool or a liar; perhaps both. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who makes much of racial differences in suspension rates but ignores his own department&rsquo;s well established data that explain those differences, is, at best, deceitful.</p>
<p>Propaganda of this kind puts unfair pressure on teachers and administrators who may well be disciplining students as fairly as possible. There may be legitimate debate as to whether school suspension cures misbehavior or about how specific offenses should be punished, but to pretend that there are no race differences in student behavior &mdash; and to blame &ldquo;prejudiced&rdquo; teachers for differences in suspension rates &mdash; is contemptible. People who make these claims do not care about facts. They ignore anything that contradicts their blinkered conception of blacks (and now Hispanics) as perpetual victims and whites as perpetual oppressors.</p>
<p>Nor is it the job of the media to swallow whatever Arne Duncan tells them. Why did not even one mainstream account of the DOE study point out the obvious: that different groups are disciplined at different rates because they behave differently? Reporters who pass along deceit are as contemptible as the bureaucrats and &ldquo;scholars&rdquo; who feed it to them.</p>

<p>Disagree.  Do we honestly think that a 15-year old black is that less likely to be committing a &#8220;liquor offense&#8221; than a 15-year old white?  The reason the black arrest rate for liquor is far less than white is because cops are too busy in the ghetto chasing murderers to worry about a teenager carrying around a &#8220;foty.&#8221;  Meanwhile, there is so little crime in white areas that a 15-year old white teenager drinking a beer in public is a big deal.</p>
<p>As for the subject matter at hand, the black-white gap in suspensions would be even higher, except &#8220;Zero Tolerance&#8221; policies were implemented precisely to find pretexts to suspend whites, for &#8220;offenses&#8221; which should be ignored.</p>

<p>When the moon completely covers the &#8220;visible&#8221; sun (i.e. the photosphere), you&rsquo;ll see some faint shining around the moon.  That&rsquo;s the solar corona, some hot and self-luminescent gases, but since they&rsquo;re a million times fainter than the photosphere, they only time that the naked human eye can see them is during a total solar eclipse.</p>
<p>Think of the corona as minor crime, and the photosphere as major crime.  Here in my mostly white St. Louis suburb of Ballwin, the photosphere is covered up all the time, and the corona is always visible.  A Ballwin cop that confronts the 17-yo with a crushed up beer can driving his father&rsquo;s truck is making the biggest  bust he will for either side of a week to his present time.  In North St. Louis, the photosphere is always visible, so the &#8220;corona&#8221; of 17-yo&rsquo;s having crushed beer cans is invisible for all the cops scraping fresh bodies off the pavement.</p>

<p>If white kids are quietly drinking behind the high school under the bleachers, they aren&rsquo;t shooting, stabbing, or brawling with each other therefore they usually draw little attention to their activities.</p>
<p>Blacks, on the other-hand, do so publicly and too often violently.</p>
<p>If black teens kept their behavior private and peaceful, they wouldn&rsquo;t draw the attention of the police. </p>

This is certainly going to skew the actual numbers of black people getting arrested for public intoxication or related offenses.</p>
<p>Having said that, I have had the misfortune of being around a lot of black people in my younger years, and I can say that my experiences back up any self-reports about Whites drinking more than blacks. Young White people drink more than young blacks; however, White people of all age groups are more than likely arrested for minor crimes(public intoxication, loitering, disturbing the peace, etc.) at a much higher rate than blacks simply because the police in black areas have to overlook a lot of minor offenses just to keep the more violent crimes in check.</p>
<p>On a side note: If alcohol is an extreme contributor to bad behavior, bad decisions, and increased criminality, then why are blacks, who drink less than Whites, much more prone to violence? Even if there are several factors at play, one of them has to be biological if there is to be any explanation that covers such a large discrepancy in the percentage of white and black violent crimes, and that is so uniform in numbers from coast to coast.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-85440" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> As a young college student, I have my limited anecdotal evidence to support Jared&rsquo;s assertion that underage drinking and drinking violations in general are worse and somewhat more prevalent in the White community.</p>
<p>Ghetto black culture has the term &#8220;drunker than a white boy&#8221; after a night of over-inebriation.  A strong drinking culture (with its bonuses of fun and camaraderie at the expense of alcohol&rsquo;s ill effects) is simply much stronger and much more ingrained in the White community than in the Black community.  </p>
<p>The intoxicated substance of choice for Black Americans appears to be mostly marijuana.  I&rsquo;d prefer this drug for them as I&rsquo;d rather have a mellowed dumb young black male high on THC than a young black male confident and aggressive on alcohol. Though being high on the &#8220;mellow&#8221; drug doesn&rsquo;t seem to lessen their criminality unfortunately.</p>
<p>Genetically speaking, Europe&rsquo;s long history of alcohol consumption was an integral aspect to western civilization&rsquo;s advancement, and no doubt naturally selected for adaptations to consume alcohol more effectively.  I know this trend is clear with the phenomenon of &#8220;Asian flush&#8221;, though I don&rsquo;t know how well it correlates with Sub-Saharan African genes.  A difficulty with lactose tolerance is a know fact amongst Sub-Saharan African populations, something a liberal will often admit while simultaneously calling race a social construct. (cognitive dissonance anyone?)</p>
<p>I need remind readers that there could be a sub-conscious aversion to alcohol by Africans, for it was ultimately alcohol which so simplified and cheapened the slave trade for White Europeans.</p>
<p>However, as Jared Taylor points having a history of &#8220;fire-water&rsquo;s&#8221; ill effects hasn&rsquo;t stopped the native Americans from consuming it in vast quantity, even though alcohol had caused immense damage to their old tribal societies.  So consider the fire-water hypothesis questionable.</p>
<p>Also, I had recently spent time in America&rsquo;s beachfront house of Sodom known euphemistically as &#8220;Panama City&#8221;.  It is this crap hole of a beach resort where thousands of White college students coagulate for inebriated shenanigans.  Also, it gives an opportunity for low-income, non collegiate young blacks to drive down from their homes in Alabama, Georgia, Florida and Mississippi to join in on the party. (or to harass white girls)</p>
<p>What did I notice?  Cops specifically targeted whites for alcohol citations.  It felt as if they were almost afraid of the black men who were nearly as drunk (or equally as high) as any White person on the street . My only conclusion is the cops are there to make money for the state with DUIs, MIPs, and PIs.  A black male likely would be uncooperative and aggressive if stopped to ask for I.D. for his beer, while a white would passively go along and pay the fine and show up to court on time.  A black wouldn&rsquo;t likely show up at all, adding strain to the system (and not money) by having to elevate his status to a wanted criminal.  </p>
<p>Perhaps America&rsquo;s overly conservative drinking laws are merely another &#8220;white-tax&#8221; for the benefits of minorities.  Whites enjoy our beers, fine wines, aged whiskey&rsquo;s and what have you, and America decided harass the one vice we engage in more than our colored counterparts.  </p>
<p>Even when it comes down to us behaving badly, the system just feels outright Anti-White. </p>

Drinking alcohol seems to me to be likely considered as not so bad a thing (and even expected) in many of our sub-cultures of whites in America, besides it is a legal substance.  The white has had a heritage of values handed down that encourage and reward behavior such as drinking (when it is legal) precisely because it has been socially acceptable, whereas it is unfortunate in modern times that America&rsquo;s blacks have been rewarded oftentimes by being deceitful, sly, and down-right inscrutible&hellip;they will insist this tradition (the Mask) is because it was necessary for their survival.  It is not so unusual for many whites to  wonder why *cheating* is not viewed quite the same way in black solciety as in white society.  The black has considered it necessary to their survival to hide many things, so hiding the truth about test scores/cheating/false reporting of crime and everything else is simply a part of the cultural heritage for the blacks in  America which is why so many blacks, sadly, are still part of a counter culture rather than a sub-culture.  The problem is that today&rsquo;s pop culture is defining *American Culture*.  I think that is sure to create even more violence and negative behavior affecting more and more whites as well as continuing to reward innapropriate black behaviors  in school and out, in the work place, in all aspects of society.  Things appear to be quite grim&hellip;living in *interesting* times.</p>

<p>But you are right, it doesn&rsquo;t really sound correct.   Actually I just figured it out.  The drinking offenses by whites are probably a result of college parties.  Cops will hand out 30-40 drinking tickets at a time when they bust a frat party.  Mystery solved. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so sick and tired of La Raza being lumped in with Whites in crime data and school offense behavior. It started around 1998, 1999. </p>
<p>95 percent White, no racial tension. No kidding!</p>
<p>Public schools are preparatory prisons for non-Whites. Blacks get &#8220;Brekkfiss&#8221;, lunch and in some cases dinner on the White taxpayer&rsquo;s dime. The teachers are wardens. Hell, most of the public schools already got cops in &#8216;em. Some of the public school systems are so bad that principals are able to call upon SWAT teams and helicopters, yes, helicopters fly over the school grounds. Public school is pretty much prison.</p>
<p>Whites wind up paying all the taxes for them and on top of that they have to pay to send their kids to religious and other private schools just to avoid Demarquavious and Jose. Triple tax.</p>

In schools where blacks are in a very small minority of the student body this may be true. It was true in the schools I attended as a teenager. In schools where blacks represent a large minority of the students, and particularly in schools where they are in the majority it is not true. When blacks are in the minority most try to behave. When they are in the majority most behave they way they want to behave. </p>
