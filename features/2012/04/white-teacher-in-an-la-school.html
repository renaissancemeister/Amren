	                	<p>I am a professional teacher, an unknown white teacher in Los Angeles, toiling away in a grey, run-down government high school hidden from the eyes of the public behind a nine-foot, spike-topped, chain link fence. There are no locks on the front gate; they were broken long ago. The official sign that notes our location has been scratched over with the number 187, a reference to Section 187 of the California Penal Code, which defines the crime of murder.</p>
<p>My school is typical of Southern California: majority Hispanic, a small handful of blacks, a stray white or Asian. Blacks are not welcome in the neighborhoods where I work; the students themselves tell me Hispanic gangs drive them from the projects through intimidation and violence. This is never reported by the local media; they are too busy looking for the Great White Bigot and institutional racism, neither of which can ever be found in the Los Angeles Basin.</p>
<p>My classroom was old and worn when I arrived. It had been dragged over, rats included, from a bleak, failing inner-city school. Yes, literally dragged over. I teach in a &ldquo;portable classroom&rdquo; that can be broken into two pieces and shipped across town on a flat-bed truck. It came to my school because some bureaucrat &mdash; there are many who make well over $100,000 a year and work in plush, secure, downtown offices with private bathrooms, far away from the schools &mdash; decreed that upgrading the infrastructure of &ldquo;failing&rdquo; schools would close the gap. As a result, several mostly-black schools were rebuilt from the inside out and ground up. We got the leftovers.</p>
<p>I have not had a raise in 10 years. In fact, my pay has decreased, mostly through district-imposed &ldquo;furloughs,&rdquo; which is a school-district code word for pay cut. Yesterday, I learned that school will end four days early this year. That is better than last year, when seven days were whacked off the 180 days of mandated instructional time &mdash; and from my paycheck, too. The Los Angeles Unified School District got a special directive from the California state legislature to &ldquo;shorten the school year&rdquo; in order to curb payroll.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/LAUSD-Logo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99528" title="LAUSD Logo" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/LAUSD-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="416" height="416"/></a></p>
<p>However, according to local talk-radio jocks and know-it-all opinion writers in the papers, we teachers are paid far too much for what we produce: a drop-out rate of approximately 60 percent, and unemployable graduates who cannot read, write or compute. Oh, what they don&rsquo;t know! I&rsquo;d like to tell them about lazy, low-IQ students who enter high school reading at a 2nd or 3rd grade level, who speak little or fractured English, are disrespectful to adults, and are hostile to the very idea of education. I&rsquo;d like to tell the public about the students who arrive late every day unprepared, surly, and without textbooks, pens, pencils or paper, let alone homework. Yet these same students always have bags of fast food, and never seem to be without the latest 4G cell phone, iPad, iPod or any other i gadget, all of which are strictly forbidden. This is more because they could be stolen than because they distract from learning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m told repeatedly at compulsory, professional development sessions held every other week, that it is my fault that Hispanic and black students score at the bottom on NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress) tests. I&rsquo;m told that I am the reason students who barely speak English and cannot multiply or divide can&rsquo;t pass the required 4th-grade-level exit exam they need to finish high school. It is because of me that English learners aren&rsquo;t getting past a rudimentary level even after years of intensive English-language instruction.</p>
<p>And what is needed? More teacher oversight, more professional development, better, newer methods of teaching, and textbooks loaded with photos that reflect &ldquo;changing demographics&rdquo; so &ldquo;students of color&rdquo; can see &ldquo;others who look like them.&rdquo; These changes will surely raise state test scores and staunch high drop-out rates. Rarely is there enough money to cover teachers&rsquo; salaries yet there always seem to be funds to pay for one lavish, hundred-million-dollar theoretical program after another that, we are told, will finally close the achievement gap.</p>
<p>In all my years of being talked down to and patronized by know-nothing, professional educational theorists who have never set foot in a classroom, I have never seen a single one of these expensive mandates succeed: not plush new buildings, nor brand new textbooks filled with &ldquo;people of color,&rdquo; nor the latest fad teaching hypothesis, nor all-day teacher professional development sessions. Not one has raised student scores or stopped students from dropping out. All have failed spectacularly.</p>
<p>Do you think the educational system will ever admit that maybe, just maybe, the problem could be the students? That perhaps the reasons for black and brown failure and high dropout rates are low IQ and lack of interest &mdash; and not institutional racism, bad teachers or run-down buildings? Of course, to suggest this would cost me my job, my pension, and my reputation.</p>
<p>From time to time, I will try to keep you updated on how Los Angeles tries to educate students, but first, a note about the esthetic environment we have created for students.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring Students Through &ldquo;Art&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>In 1932, Nelson Rockefeller commissioned Mexican artist and socialist, Diego Rivera, to paint a mural in the lobby of the almost-complete Rockefeller Center in New York City. Rivera was given a theme: &ldquo;Man at the Crossroads Looking for Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future.&rdquo; Rockefeller wanted a mural that would make people stop and think.</p>
<p>The resulting painting included a depiction of a Moscow May Day demonstration showing workers marching with red flags, and with a portrait of Lenin at the head of the parade. Rockefeller was annoyed, and asked Rivera to change Lenin&rsquo;s face to that of an unknown laborer&rsquo;s, but the painter refused. The mural was paid for on May 22, 1933, and draped until 1934, when it was chiseled off the wall and hauled away in wheelbarrows.</p>
<p>We should be so lucky today.</p>
<p>Today, in the Hispanic-dominated, taxpayer-funded public schools of Los Angeles, colorful anti-white, Hispanic-grievance murals depict murderous communist heroes such as Che Guevara and Fidel Castro on walls where children view them every day. Other murals, including some on the walls of elementary schools, call for the removal of &ldquo;illegal white people&rdquo; and &ldquo;European colonial squatters&rdquo; who have &ldquo;caused the destruction of our land and people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Anahuac.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-99519" title="Anahuac" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Anahuac.jpg" alt="" width="497" height="511"/></a></p>
<p>Outside Roosevelt High School in East Los Angeles there is a 400-foot mural called Anahuac, which is a Nahuatl (Aztec) word that is supposed to mean Mexico and Central America. Students entering the school walk by panels depicting Europeans hanging and burning Mexicans, smashing their babies&rsquo; heads against rocks, and feeding the flesh of Mexicans to their &ldquo;war dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/War-Dogs.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-99520" title="War Dogs" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/War-Dogs.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"/></a></p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Babies.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-99521" title="Babies" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Babies-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"/></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one point on the mural, a Spanish conquistador stands on top of a mountain of skulls, wielding a torch in one hand and a sword run through three indigenous heads in the other. A plaque over the conquistador says:</p>
<blockquote><p>23 million of our people (95% of our population was savagely killed from 1519-1580). The destruction of our history of over 4300 years of civilization along with the racial rape and cultural castration of our population left, and to this day, continue to leave our people hopelessly chained to the interest that enrich Europeans.</p>
<p>These ongoing tragedies have served Europeans well in the exploitation of our people and their enrichment from the wealth of our land. This has happened everywhere in our &ldquo;Western Hemisphere.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/23-Million.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-99522" title="23 Million" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/23-Million.jpg" alt="" width="537" height="362"/></a></p>
<p>The mural also includes a note to Europeans proclaiming: &ldquo;Your people are . . . inferior to us in your morals, ethics, and humanity &mdash; by your collective actions of the last 500 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another blood-stained note says, in full capitals:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the midst of the genocide our people were raped!!! Laws were implemented to keep us ignorant of our language, past, our great accomplishments and who we really are!!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Genocide.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-99523" title="Genocide" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Genocide.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="276"/></a></p>
<p>A third message, also in full caps, proclaims:</p>
<blockquote><p>1492 - marks the beginning of the destruction of more than 100 million human lives in this Wesern Hemisphere alone. 23 million of those were destroyed in Anahuac what is now Mexico and Central America by European invaders.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/1492.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-99524" title="1492" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/1492.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="368"/></a></p>
<p>Another section of the mural addresses Roosevelt high students as &ldquo;Mexicans&rdquo; and urges them to &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; and &ldquo;find out what&rsquo;s been kept from us.&rdquo; The way to do that is to read a list of books that includes <em>American Holocaust</em> which, according to its publisher, chronicles &ldquo;the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world,&rdquo; and argues that Christians just naturally do that sort of thing.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Wake-Up.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-99525" title="Wake Up" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Wake-Up.jpg" alt="" width="271" height="391"/></a></p>
<p>After the mural was completed in 2007, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> correctly reported that it &ldquo;presents a colorful depiction of the rape, slaughter and enslavement of North America&rsquo;s indigenous people by genocidal Europeans.&rdquo; When the board of trustees of the Los Angeles Unified School District was asked whether this was an appropriate sentiment for high school students, its official response was that the mural &ldquo;merely presents a different perspective&rdquo; and that there was &ldquo;no intent to remove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group responsible for creating this outrage calls itself the <a href="http://www.mexica-movement.org/">Mexica Movement</a> and claims on its website, stolencontinent.com, that it will &ldquo;take back the continent and all its natural resources&rdquo; because the continent &ldquo;belongs to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visitors to stolencontinent.com&rsquo;s homepage are greeted by the movement&rsquo;s manifesto which offers posters for download or purchase:</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Posters.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-99527" title="Posters" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Posters.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="1131"/></a></p>
<p>And what about Diego Rivera, the scorned artist whose mural was scraped from the walls of the Rockefeller Center in New York on orders from an indignant Nelson Rockefeller? His face is now dead center in a portrait of Mexican muralists Clemente Orozco (on left), Rivera, and David Siqueiros, which graces a wall of another LAUSD school in East LA, Woodrow Wilson High School. One can only imagine what Presidents Wilson and Roosevelt would think of the Mexican faces that now appear on their namesake schools.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Muralists.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99526" title="Muralists" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Muralists.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"/></a></p>
<p>This is the system in which I teach.</p>

Usually the least talented people stay in the same job, year after year, and let themselves be underpaid. Why don&rsquo;t you go teach in Japan or Korea or even Eastern Europe?

<p>That&rsquo;s uncalled for and obviously false (based on the author&rsquo;s writing skill).  The writer is giving us a valuable view from the inside and should not be disparaged for not being able to easily pick up and move to another job or field.  You call the author, with a clearly female name, a man.  But you shouldn&rsquo;t focus too much on stupidity; bad manners is more of an issue here.</p>

This is just un-mitigated incitement to racial violence any way you look at it and should not to tolerated under ANY circumstance. Why have more Americans not been made aware of the mestizo threat and intentions? (Don&rsquo;t answer, that was a retorical Q)<br/>
Life has shown, me at least, that Latinos are less prone to harm whites than backs (orders of magnitude less). Given this kinda of racist agitation, how long will it be until mestizos become more dangerous than blacks? </p>

<p>LOL! They had no accomplishments. In fact, they were so unaccomplished that in 1532 at the battle of Cajamarca, 169 Spaniards defeated an army of 80,000 indigenous tribes. The mighty Spaniards were outnumbered nearly 500 to 1. This is what we should be learning and celebrating in our schools - the mighty conquests of our people. Not the pathetic &#8216;history&rsquo; of inferiors who never even invented the whel.  </p>

They have to have a reason(an ultimatum if I were to word it) to actually change their conditioning of White people. Expecting sharks to stop feeding on you as you dangle your meaty, bloody limbs into the ocean is idiocy at its highest level. Low and behold, we have the &#8220;high IQs&#8221; doing this without hesitation. Intimidation or not, that&rsquo;s sheer stupidity.</p>
<p>I know people put a lot of emphasis on IQ, but offering yourself as shark food year after year because someone might nail you to a cross if you don&rsquo;t is the complete opposite of a high IQ in my opinion. Either that or IQ is seriously overrated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in complete disagreement with you &mdash; the low IQs actually do a much better job of networking. They&rsquo;ll mass and riot over a cheeseburger. That might not register to the rational mind, but those institutions that are at the mercy of public opinion have to notice this type of civil unrest. Hell, if low IQ means you&rsquo;re not as susceptible to being intimidated to drive yourself over a cliff, then give me a bunch of dummies.</p>
<p>Propaganda is only useful if the audience accepts it. They spend billions to keep you from doing something that you can very easily do. When a large enough percentage of any group of people just says to hell with it and does what the media tries to keep you from doing, what do you think happens? They change the rhetoric to fit the audience.</p>
<p>I know many, many White people will talk candidly about race if you get them in private; but what good does that do if they can be intimidated to the point of cultural suicide?</p>

In 1986 I voted for the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration bill because we were<br/>
 told it would solve the problem of massive illegal immigration. In his<br/>
diaries, President Ronald<br/>
Reagan said he was going to sign the bill because we had to regain<br/>
control of our borders. The Simpson-Mazzoli bill contained three<br/>
promises:  The government would make a concerted effort to control the borders.<br/>
An effective employer verification program would ensure that only legal workers were hired. One-time amnesty would be granted for people illegally in the United States. </p>
<p>All<br/>
 three promises were broken.<br/>
The government has made no serious effort to control our borders.<br/>
Employers continue knowingly to hire illegal immigrants without any real<br/>
 fear of punishment.<br/>
The promises went out the window as fast as Reagan put his John Hancock on the bill.. I&rsquo;m not condoning it, just pointing out the fact that he NEVER would have agreed if there were not these requirements&hellip; Course he should have thought about who he was dealing with..</p>

He knew very well that a promise is nothing, a ruse to provide cover for his decision. The lobbying record for that bill will tell the tale. Reagan was influenced by GOP-led interests like the Chamber of Commerce, growers&rsquo; organizations, construction organizations, et cetera, all very powerful and influential in immigration and labor policy. Reagan may have had regrets, but those regrets reflected his servitude to elements of his own party that couldn&rsquo;t care less about the huge damage that bill caused.</p>

(their first victims clearly being blacks)</p>
<p>Whites are in no position to contest the lands of &#8220;Aztlan&#8221; because we aren&rsquo;t doing any of the logical procedures in defending territory: securing for your population, eliminating or minimizing foreign populations, and setting up some kind of defensive exterior. </p>
<p>Whites have done NONE of this, actually the opposite of these things, and is what causes me to hold no ill-respect towards Hispanics as they are merely doing what is both available, natural, and expedient to them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what we give to others and this point.  What concerns me is when is White America going to TAKE.  When will we say something is for ourselves and no other?  When will we take, hold, and possess a land of our choosing?  </p>
<p>EVERY group does this but us.  We can cry foul as we recede in power and population and moan as every state secedes to non-White populations, but when will be the day we say that this land, whatever it may be, is ours.  I&rsquo;ll take anything at this point, any small sliver.  Once White America is given something of their own, no matter how weak, I believe a hidden tenacity will suddenly awaken, and no land will be more beloved and secured than that simple, White homeland.  </p>

Most Mexicans probably don&rsquo;t even know this and our government doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier for them to either &hellip; They are what you call Indian givers..

<p>Look at how the leap is made from the Spanish atrocities (which were obviously barbaric) to suddenly making it seem ALL white people did the killing in Latin america.</p>
<p>The people of the U.S. never did anything bad to people South of the Border.  No genocides.  No raping or pillaging.  Sure we fought a war with Mexico over control of some territory they inherited from the spanish and could not manage due to Indian attacks that kept Mexicans out of that land, but we graciously PAID them money for it after the war, that it today&rsquo;s dollars amounted to BILLIONS of dollars.</p>
<p>But the fallacious linkage of Spanish atrocities foisted on the heads of the Pilgrims I mentioned is the most dangerous thing.  Blacks and their activists blame all white people everywhere and for all time for slavery, even though only 5% of blacks were ever imported to the territory of the U.S. colonies (and later states).  (This percntage is a FACT.  Look it up.)  And even though whites are the only people who specifically banned slavery AND fought a major war to enforce it (civil war).  And even though it was Africans who sold their bretheren in the first place to anyone with trade goods be they Arabs, portuguese or each other.</p>
<p>The problem is that latinos are now building a mythology of &#8216;oppression&rsquo; in which they will see white Americans as equally culpable as the Spaniards who oppressed their ancestors.  This will fuel their violence against us in the coming years.  Of course that linkage is stupid, not least because &#8216;white&rsquo; hispanics amd mestizos are basically the descendants of the conquerers and should thus hate themselves first!  (Oh, the full-blooded amerindians!  It&rsquo;s &#8216;white&rsquo; latinos and mestizos who have been opressing them for 500 years!  Oh, but it is so much better for marxists to make them think George Washington, Geroge Bush or whoever were doing the raping and torturing!)</p>
<p>By the way, the hordes of Asian immigrants coming over are trying to build a narrative of oppression too, based on the treatment of a few hundred chinese laborers who came over and had to work as hard as the Irish on the railroads!</p>
<p>Our future is on very thin ice.</p>

There grandparents would not allow their children to speak Spanish.  They wanted to be American.  The problem is that the vast numbers of immigrants that have already come and are still coming is far too much for the U.S. to handle.  They create their own ethnic enclaves where they dominate the politics and culture of the town or city.  There are many parts of L.A.  that look like a third world country where you would not want to set foot in as a white American.  Third world immigration needs to be halted or our identity will cease to exist.  </p>

We were here first not them, a fact proven by historical demography. We also hold soverignty over the land not them. Needless to say, we must be more active in fighting the cause. Murals are a potent expression. Allowing this invading mestizo, chollo, indians into our cities and ceding to them the conscious claim of it with their murals is a disgusting weakness. Fight back with our own murals. One which will express the historical chord of our people. The Loyalists in Northern Ireland face a similar situation as here and also happen to be ancestral cousins of the true blue native Americans. They fight for their land with murals. I suggest copying such murals on them. The following offers an excellent example:</p>

<p>From the time I was born in the United States, the southwest portion has always belonged to  the United States of America. I was not alive in the 1800&#8242;s when the Mexican-American war was fought and won by the United States and, in fact, my grandparents had not yet immigrated to the United States.  Therefore, I nor my ancestors could have &#8220;stolen&#8221; any land from the Mexicans.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really happening is that the Mexicans are projecting their racist attitudes onto white people and using past history as a way to publicly express that racism. They have their own country called Mexico but they created an unlivable country there. So, they ran away from that failed country and came here and are now threatening to take our country away from us.</p>
<p>We white people are fools to not have fought back beginning years ago. The turncoat politicians are also to blame for the nonsense that the Mexicans are allowed to spew inside our schools. </p>
<p>I wish Mary Morrison luck in continuing to work in that hostile LAUSD and I look forward to more articles from her. May God protect her from the verbal racial assaults.</p>

Half of them were American immigrants and their descendents. The remainder of the country was Indian controlled under the sovereignty of the central government in Mexico City. To me that is a very tenuous ancestral claim. Indeed, there are perhaps anywhere between 2.5-5 million Hispanics (And thats being generious) who are descendents of those original Hispanics which were incorporated into the US. In addition, such Hispanics are almost entirely white and racially, culturally, and ethnically do not consider themselves part of these razistas.  The remainder of Hispanics almost entirely originate from immigrating legally and illegally here since 1965. It is they who are the invaders. </p>

<p>What you wrote is 100 percent true. Reagan was a corporate whore and big phony  who accelerated massively the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans in California. Mitt Rommney will do for Texas and Arizona what Reagan did for California. As I have stated here many times:at rock bottom the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans is driven by the low wage labor policy of the Coporations who own both Republican and Democratic candidates. If Barack Obama is elected it will effectively be  the end of the Republican Party&hellip;enter highly racialized Native Born White American Patriot politcs. The end of the Republican Party will be the best thing that ever happened to Native Born White Americans. The Leftists and Liberals who are anticipating the arrival of the Republican Party&rsquo;s demise this comming November are completely oblivious to the fact that something will  fill the political vacum&hellip;something highly racialized and White.</p>

<p>I see jabbering lunatics on both sides of the political spectrum, and no intelligent synthesis or third position.</p>
<p>the left seems to think that in demanding open borders, they are fighting AGAINST corporate America - which makes me wonder if they are all simply brain-damaged.</p>
<p>the right seems concerned primarily with bashing environmentalists, denying the fairly self-evident cataclysm of climate change, praising corporate rule, blaming leftists for open borders policies, and fretting about gay marriage (the fraying of the moral fabric of society etc. etc.) – in other words are equally brain-damaged.</p>
<p>of course, a winning political formula would be easy to craft:</p>
<p>close the borders, evict illegals, eliminate all race preferences, ban sharia explicitly, flog corporate America into submission until they respect the law, worker&rsquo;s rights, the environment, and the nation&rsquo;s borders.</p>
<p>state as bluntly as possible that in a multiracial society, the white community must speak as one voice, and has specific interests.</p>
<p>the corporate right seems determined to wreck the planet as quickly as possible, at which point the survival of Western civilization is a nonissue.</p>
<p>the left seems determined to crash Western civilization, which sets back human history a couple of millennia.</p>
<p>At this point, not much to choose from, since I can&rsquo;t take a conservative seriously who doesn&rsquo;t want to conserve the Earth, nor can I take a leftist seriously who doesn&rsquo;t take the rights of the working majority seriously because he is too busy worrying about &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; or some other Phantom issue. </p>

What President has ever signed a bill predicated on a promise by the opposing party? Both the Democrats and the Republicans had their snouts in the &rsquo;86 Amnesty, for different reasons. The GOP stipulated a laughable border-security condition in an unspecified future bill as political cover. The Democrats may have even sold that condition to the GOP. The lobbying record stands-Reagan was heavily influenced by business interests important to the GOP during the amnesty debate and were also essential to the bill itself. </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-82871" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>My grandparents were educated by the British in a completely non-PC environment. They earned a classical liberal education that was rigorous and rightfully extolled the virtues of the West. </p>
<p>Consequently, these humble peasant boys were able to imbibe a truly modern and Western mindset. They had to grapple with a rigorous curriculum that wasn&rsquo;t catered to the lowest common denominator. The students were expected to rise to the challenge. The system wasn&rsquo;t reduced to the lowest common denominator, rather it was designed to keep that creature out of the system.</p>
<p>Their education was far superior to mine which was leftist rubbish and watered down everything else. India has institutionalized every evil that Ms Morrison has detailed: affirmative action, dumbed down curriculum, institutionalized resentment, fabricated glory and a tale of eternal woe and humiliation at the hands of the West.</p>
<p>The result: stupid, resentful students who are barely qualified to sign each others&rsquo; papers. </p>
<p>Now, to be honest, India didn&rsquo;t have much to tear down. However, America has achieved so much glory at such high cost. The policies promoted by the education establishment as well as the &#8216;philosophy&rsquo; that informs the same is treasonous. In a sane society, the historic majority would rise as one and chase these lunatic criminals out with pitchforks. At the same time, they would do all they can to secure their borders and protect their communities.</p>
<p>The fault lies in the historic majority. Never in the course of human affairs has a community ceded so much power so swiftly. And such power was ceded to groups that seem to bear an insatiable hatred of that very community. Then, just to make things more interesting, whites continue to peddle resentment against whites as part of ordinary business practice.</p>
<p>The sickness of the education system is yet another symptom of the overall crisis of the West. There&rsquo;s something wrong with white race. Well-wishers like myself are astounded by what appears to be infinite capacity for self delusion coupled with a death wish.</p>
<p>I have no solutions. All I know is that I cherish the West. And the West I know is determined to do away with itself. And I can do nothing to stop it. </p>

They learned their lesson after the annihilation of &#8220;Comprehensive Immigration Reform&#8221; by the public in 2006 and 2007. Any talk of amnesty or any talk of an amnesty in small pieces is met by a bulldozer of opposition. The DREAM Act was put to sleep 16 mo. ago largely because of public outcry. Confidence is high. The most stubborn problem lies in stopping legal immigration. This is the next challenge.</p>

At other times, I admired their athletic abilities. However, there never were any instances that forced me to conclude that Blacks were an intelligent race of people or serious about school. I simply couldn&rsquo;t do this because far too many of them were thuggish, mentally slow, overly emotional and uncouth.  </p>

No one but a huckster for Charles Atlas pretends that it is possible to take a sickly fifteen year old &#8220;97 pound weakling,&#8221; and turn him into an award winning athlete. Nevertheless, we continue to expect public school teachers to turn the largely illegitimate children of the underclass into brilliant scholars. </p>

Unfortunately, most pro-whites are not willing to be as wise as the anti-whites. Anti-whites see everything as a tool to be used against whites.<br/>
The terms ANTI-WHITE, ANTI-RACIST,WHITE GENOCIDE, are great tools to use in this struggle.<br/>
I wonder if our ape ancestors were as reluctant to use a stone after seeing an enemie&rsquo;s brains bashed out as our pro-white brothers seem to be with regard to the WHITE GENOCIDE assault tool.</p>

I spent a summer a few years ago in a small poor village I wandered into in the state of Jalisco, Mexico, a region that for reasons I have no knowledge of is very white. The wife of the couple I stayed with had blue eyes.</p>
<p>Jalisco is pretty far south, and I found the culture and attitudes there to be what I think of as very Mexican. But I haven&rsquo;t visited the very southern more indian regions.</p>
<p>Writing this comment is making me nostalgic for Mexico&hellip;I&rsquo;m very fond of the diversity in the world, and it&rsquo;s a shame that that diversity will be ended with the blending together that&rsquo;s falsely called &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course right now it&rsquo;s only the White race that&rsquo;s being targeted to have its countries flooded with non-White aliens and be blended out of existence, but if the anti-Whites are successful with our genocide, globalist interests will then have a free hand with many other races that may be less able to resist.</p>
<p>Our concern right now must be in stopping WHITE GENOCIDE.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t recall that they flayed people alive, but I could be wrong. But they certainly did cut out their hearts while they were alive, in great numbers. Conquistadors visiting the inside of some of their temples atop their pyramids, where the open heart surgery took place without benefit of anesthetic, found the walls covered with a crust of blood, which if punctured oozed out liquid blood from beneath it. </p>
<p>The priests who did the sacrifices wore their blood-soaked hair perpetually unwashed, so having a priest over for dinner must have been a strain.</p>
<p>After having their hearts cut out, sacrificial victims were rolled down the stairs of the steep pyramids (the steps of some surviving pyramids in the Aztec domain are so steep I was afraid to climb them, though some others did) and often were cooked up and dined on.</p>
<p>I would love to have some idea of what the religious feeling behind these practices was, but if Sahagún and other early clerics who chronicled the practices made note of that, I guess I was too young to be interested when I wrote my paper.</p>
<p>When Cortés was in the capital as a rather overstaying guest of Moctezuma, his sublime skill with human beings (but don&rsquo;t say anything good about Cortés in Mexico! Seriously) sufficed to keep things pretty chilled, but when he had to return to the coast and leave his garrison without him in the Aztec capital, things went to the devil and&hellip;.I forget the sequence&hellip;I think Cortés returned, but the revolt was on, and a good number of the Spaniards were able to retreat from the capital, but lost most of their treasure and many of their lives in the lake that surrounded the Aztec capital (now Mexico City). From the far shores of the lake they watched a number of their comrades being marched up the pyramid stairs and their hearts cut out.</p>
<p>Cortés of course returned, aided principally by the Tlaxcalans,* the tribe most resistant to the Aztecs, and destroyed Aztec power utterly.</p>
<p>Mexico has always fascinated me, I think since I was about 4 years old and saw the Donald, Mickey, and Goofy movie, &#8220;The Three Caballeros.&#8221; Seriously.</p>
<p>*In Baja I met a taxi driver who was Tlaxcalan, and he told me that a standard joke in Mexico is that whenever he or any other Tlaxcalan is introduced to another Mexican, the other Mexican says smilingly, &#8220;Ah, un traidor (traitor).&#8221; But even with this Tlaxcalan, when in my naiveté I spoke favorably of the abilities of Cortés, he became silent, and then explained to me with great courtesy (one thing I find charming about Mexico) that that was not a popular way to speak.</p>

<p>As I always say, most whites have little contact with the 12% US black population.  The extent of their experience with blacks was watching tv shows like Good Times (poor but honest) or Fresh Prince of Bellaire (equal or maybe even better than whites).</p>
<p>However, having grown up in Detroit I know the real story.  EVERY person in my family has been assaulted or robbed by a black person.   We were ran out of every neighborhood we ever lived in.   And they aren&rsquo;t the bad ones for wrecking the neighborhoods of Detroit.  I AM THE BAD ONE FOR NOTICING THE BLACKS DID IT.   </p>

 <br/>
I lived there for 40 years, grew up in the DFW Metroplex and watched it die. Living in Texas, I got tired of watching the news and seeing images of the latest pregnant white woman killed by a drunk Mexican driver. And God forbid you have an accident with these folks as so many of them prefer to drive without insurance.<br/>
 <br/>
The schools in the suburbs used to be white and exceptional, now Hispanics are everywhere and the schools rank in the bottom 5-10 of the nation. In terms of SAT averages, California scores better than Texas. Lots of ignorant people competing for low wages is not a recipe for a bright, successful future.<br/>
 <br/>
I&rsquo;m not sure where the above poster got his stats on welfare use but Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies found last year that Texas and California had the same percentage use of welfare in immigrant households with children (61% in both states).<br/>
 <br/>
And where does the above guy get his info on Latinos turning their back on Spanish (as an embarrassing relic of the Old Country)? Of the foreign born in Texas in 2009,  43.2 percent of naturalized citizens age 5 and older were LEP (Limited English Proficiency) (the number is 69.5 percent for noncitizens). Of the foreign born in California in 2009,  46.5 percent of naturalized citizens age 5 and older were LEP compared to  68.9 percent of noncitizens.<br/>
The numbers for Texas and California are practically interchangeable.Now maybe all the Mexicans you know in Texas are smart, hard-working souls but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the rest of the state is that way. In fact, the statistics show that Texas is really no better off than California (in some ways-like SAT scores, etc it is worse).<br/>
 <br/>
 In California 45% of whites and 64% of Hispanics voted for the Democrat candidate for governor in 2010. In Texas 29% of whites and 61% of Hispanics voted for the Democrat candidate for governor in 2010. Thus the numbers tell is its the whites who are different in California (more liberal) versus Texas (more conservative) and not the Mexicans.</p>

The Aztecs&rsquo; own legend was that they had migrated down from a far northern land (I believe that&rsquo;s the Aztlán of the chicano activists?) until they came to the large lake by which they saw an eagle perched on a cactus and with a serpent in its mouth (the motif on the present Mexican flag), and there they lived very poorly and hired out as mercenaries for surrounding tribes. War being their profession, they grew to power themselves and built their capital Tenochtitlán on an island in the center of the lake. The lake is filled in today and is Mexico City.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read, the ruling caste was mannerly and refined and had a very sensible way of selecting its rulers according to ability. Nobles often walked about sniffing flowers (I suppose because of the presence of priests who never washed their blood-soaked hair), and I believe that drunkenness, possibly even drinking at all, before being elderly was a capital offense&hellip;.I&rsquo;m not certain of that. But in old age you were allowed to drink.</p>
<p>As the Mexicans say, &#8220;Como México, no hay dos.&#8221; (There&rsquo;s not another country that is like Mexico)</p>
<p>Not yet, anyway. Just part of a country. And being among Mexicans up here doesn&rsquo;t feel at all like being among Mexicans in Mexico. And certainly not to the Mexicans themselves.</p>

If Europeans left, who would pay for the government services on which mestizos depend? Mestizos and American Indians do not even get along where I live. As for Che, he was of European ancestry. The notion of indigenous mestizos is a fraud.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-83512" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi Mary - - first of all thanks for all the hard work you put into being a teacher.  My job is highly paidI could never work for such a low salary and such little appreciation.  But its not the worst job in the world, nor is it really a mystery how to solve your particular dilemma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Race&#8221; is obscuring reality here.  The reality is that we are all related in varying degrees to Europeans and several types of non-Europeans that goes for Mexicans, most blacks and quite a few Whites as well.  I&rsquo;m living proof.  I&rsquo;m officially black, but I have French, Scottish and East Indian great grandparents in addition to African ancestors. Your last name&rsquo;s Morrison, you might be at least partly Scottish.  You might hate me (assuming that because you write for AmRen) but I would be a fool to hate you for being white when I have the same Celt blood in my veins.  In my view, people need to be taught about the truth, the good and the bad of their backgrounds. Fact: the Europeans weren&rsquo;t any worse than the Aztecs the Japanese or the Zulus. Also, they need to be taught that they can only overcome if they learn math, science, and English better than the average American.  If these Mexican-American kids knew the truth they would knock that chip off their shoulder and study. You want them to study for you   &mdash;   teach them to study for themselves.  I went to a private school where we were by and large taught that. I now have a pretty high IQ and a good job (yea!).  I guess it&rsquo;s not all genetics huh?</p>
<p>For you Mary, that&rsquo;s the good news.  You now know the solution.  The bad news is that you, as the teacher, need to be the one to teach them the hard truth.  But to do that, you need to forget about wasting your time complaining - which most public school teachers do for a living.   In general public school teachers think their job is so hard and that they are underpaid. The priority for most of these teachers is to make their lives easier and earn more money.  So you and your colleagues spend a lot of your time, creativity and effort feeling sorry for yourselves, going on and on about how you need more money, you need fewer kids, how Mexicans and blacks are unteachable.  My favorite teacher grip is: &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t the whole class be made up of all upper middle class white and asian kids with home tutors &hellip; boo hoo hoo&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Give a little thought to how other civil servants get paid less and do their job better: firemen, postal workers and of course people in the armed services. You send a letter in Guam and almost without fail it arrives in perfect condition anywhere in the US in a couple of days - no complaints, ifs ands or buts.  Think about how much they get paid, what they have to do for that pay and how they are still the best in the world at it.  Firemen run into burning buildings to grab babies.  They can&rsquo;t say &#8220;I&rsquo;m not saving them because they&rsquo;re Mexican&#8221; - like you can about teaching.  Can you imagine? Soldiers don&rsquo;t have 40 hour or even 60 hour work weeks.  They work continuously in chunks of 12-18 MONTHS! If you had to put in even 1/100th of the sacrifice of your typical service person you&rsquo;d be on permanent strike.  You struggle to teach a child to read English and do math and are quick to say that its because he&rsquo;s black or Mexican. But then that same kid goes to the US Marines and comes out a combat engineer, linguist or communications specialist. Sudden IQ boost?  Nope, better instructors.</p>
<p>Get your act together because despite all your hard work you and your colleagues are not working nearly as hard or as well as your counterparts in the other services.  Then, disgracefully, you blame your poor results on other people&rsquo;s races.</p>

The public rage before the shoot downs of amnesty in &rsquo;06 and &rsquo;07 spooked them. According to the Chicago Tribune, in an article during the DREAM Act debates, Hispanic political advocacy groups now have dedicated posters for immigration news stories to offset the overwhelmingly negative response about any suggestion of legalization. Even in left wing warhorses such as the NY Times and the Washington Post, every news item about the poor immigrants is pummeled with anti-amnesty and anti-immigrant responses. The rage is palpable and must be common knowledge among Hispanics at this point. Why these media giants bother with propaganda anymore is a mystery. They lost. All that remains is politics.</p>

<p>- It works (or would work) that way in every ethno-state on the planet.  The disparity betweens groups is only one cause for  bringing about ethnic conflict.  I&rsquo;m not saying conflict is non-existent within ethno groups, but separating the groups removes a large basis for much of the trouble we are now experiencing.</p>
