<div class="intro-paragraph">
How two black men helped me see the light.</div> 
</div> 



<p><em>The following account is entirely factual, but I have left out names and places so as to protect identities.</em></p>
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Trauma</strong></span></p>
<p>I am not Christopher Newsome. I am not Stephen Pitcairn. I am not Kevin Kless. But I came just inches from ending up just like all three of them &mdash; whites killed by blacks because of the color of our skin. This is the story of my racial awakening.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2006 I was about one week into my junior year of college. I was returning home from a fraternity party with two of my white friends at about 1:45 in the morning. We were heading through the largely white, &ldquo;safer&rdquo; part of town that bordered campus. After walking about eight blocks, we were less than a block from my apartment, and exactly one block from school grounds, when I noticed a car idling in the street.</p>
<p>Before I could process what was going on, a young black man hopped out and headed towards the three of us. A larger, darker-skinned man hung back by the idling vehicle. The approaching stranger brandished a gun in our faces while demanding our &ldquo;(expletive) money.&rdquo; One of my two friends immediately sprinted down the street and got away unscathed. My other friend emptied his pockets, and I pulled out my new $200 cell phone and handed it to the gunman. I opened up my wallet, and forked over twenty dollars cash, the only currency I had. &ldquo;Give me your whole (expletive) wallet,&rdquo; the robber demanded. I complied. The young black guy, gun in hand, turned around and walked briskly back to the car and got in. I was shocked, but thought I was safe. I was wrong.</p>
<p>As his accomplice got into the driver&rsquo;s seat, the gunman opened the passenger side door and fired four successive shots from about fifteen to twenty feet away before the car sped off. Three of them missed.</p>
<p>I felt a sharp burn rip through my midsection, and as I slumped to the ground all I remember was hearing my friend shriek in a high-pitched voice: &ldquo;Oh my God! Oh my God! He got shot!&rdquo; I lost consciousness.</p>
<p>About nine hours later I woke up in a hospital with doctors, my parents, and my sister at my bedside. I was doped up on morphine, and was not in much pain. As I came to, the doctors explained to me that I had undergone surgery to repair the bullet wound. The bullet had ripped through my bladder, but missed all my vital organs. I would survive. The only permanent damage would be a ten-inch surgical scar down the center of my stomach, and a button-sized scar where the bullet had entered. The surgeon had decided to leave the bullet, which was lodged in my left femur, inside my body. It would have been a major risk to attempt extraction, the doctors explained. The bullet remains there to this day.</p>
<p>I spent one week in the hospital, where my parents, sister, cousins, then-girlfriend, and various classmates visited frequently. It rained every day I was there. The school president stopped by several times, as did various detectives from the police department. After some light physical therapy I was released from the hospital with a catheter inside my body.</p>
<p>During my time in the hospital and shortly after my release, the school president, my father, and others put a lot of pressure on me to stay at the college. I agreed to do so, but continued the fall 2006 semester with two courses instead of the usual four. The rest of my junior year was typical of an irresponsible college student &mdash; though it had a different purpose for me. I smoked marijuana almost daily, drank heavily a couple times per week, and had sex often. This dulled my emotions, clouded my mind, and delayed my confrontation with the difficult realities I would eventually face.</p>
<p>As the weeks and months rolled by, there was no word of my attackers. A cash reward, which was eventually raised to $25,000, was offered for information leading to an arrest. A couple of leads surfaced, but they hit dead ends. The college and the police seemed to be pursuing the case aggressively, as it was not typical drug-dealer-on-drug-dealer violence. As far as anybody knew, mine was the first known shooting of a student in the two-century history of the university.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t develop a perspective on race for the first year and a half after I was attacked. Though of course I was aware of the color of the man who shot me, if I thought about it at all I adopted the mentality that my assailant &ldquo;just happened to be black.&rdquo; There was only one incident where I seemed to notice race, albeit briefly, and it occurred sometime during the spring of 2007. There was a black student who had shown some interest in the girl I was dating, and that didn&rsquo;t sit well with me. Driving in the car with her, I noticed him walking across one of the streets onto campus. Struck by a bit of rage, I blurted out a certain racial profanity, and my then-girlfriend quickly let me know that my comment was unacceptable. On reflection, I see that as one minor isolated incident. I still didn&rsquo;t understand race at all.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2007, I began my senior year with a semester abroad in Paris, France. It was in the City of Lights where I started to take baby-steps toward the truth. In Paris, I didn&rsquo;t use marijuana frequently. I took frequent walks around the city to see its different sections. One of the last <em>arrondissements</em> (city wards) I explored in Paris was the 20th. I noticed darker faces in this district, and I realized that I certainly didn&rsquo;t feel as comfortable as I did elsewhere in the city. The 20th was represented in the 1980s by Jean-Marie Le Pen of the Front National, whom I had made the focus of a large research project for one of my classes that semester.</p>
<p>I came back from Paris in December with by far the best GPA of any I had in four years of college. I was shocked when I landed in New York and saw so many obese and overweight people. It occurred to me that I had seen maybe three or four fat people during my entire four-month stay in Western Europe. In America, they were everywhere. While this was not a racial observation, it was a sign that I was beginning to see the world in different ways.</p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Awakening</span></strong></p>
<p>In January of 2008, I plunged back into life on campus for my final semester, and reverted to my old bad habits. Toward the end of the semester, I started carrying a knife when I was on the city streets. But the defining moment that shook my life and led to my racial awakening came from an unlikely source: Michael Moore.</p>
<p>During the 18 months between the shooting and my awakening, I was convinced that the problem was firearms. I grew up in a deep-Blue state where guns were very rare. My family never owned a gun, and I had seen a gun only once in my life before the night I was shot. In the months immediately following the incident, I looked up statistics on gun violence in the U.S., and compared them to the lower rates in Europe. Guns were the problem, I concluded, and if America could just rid itself of these awful weapons, many horror stories like mine could have been avoided.</p>
<p>It was during the first or second week of spring when my then-girlfriend and I ordered the critically-acclaimed Michael Moore documentary <em>Bowling for Columbine</em> on Netflix. I had seen Mr. Moore&rsquo;s <em>Fahrenheit 9/11</em> and since I was a Bush supporter at the time, I gave the movie low marks.</p>
<p><em>Bowling for Columbine</em> purports to examine the reasons for high levels of American gun violence, and puts much blame on the National Rifle Association. Mr. Moore frequently uses our neighbor Canada for the purpose of comparison.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BowlingForColumbine.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-100589" title="BowlingForColumbine" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BowlingForColumbine.jpg" alt="" width="369" height="280" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BowlingForColumbine.jpg 369w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BowlingForColumbine-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px"/></a></p>
<p>Canadians own firearms but have rates of gun crime that are substantially lower than ours. Mr. Moore can&rsquo;t seem to figure out why. He <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3JMSTPSsbU">asks various New Yorkers</a> why they think Canada is so safe compared to the USA. One astute young lady replies, &ldquo;I think there are mostly white people in Canada.&rdquo; Mr. Moore scoffs at this and claims that he sees &ldquo;black people everywhere&rdquo; when he&rsquo;s in Canada. He proceeds to point out that &ldquo;13 percent of the country is non-white, so the Canadians are pretty much just like us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the movie, I decided to do some research, and was startled by what I found. Mr. Moore had lied, or had certainly misled his audience. I found out that Canada was 2.6 percent black, while the United States was 12.5 percent black. I found that America was over 30 percent non-white, compared to Canada&rsquo;s 13 percent. I began to connect the dots.</p>
<p>By the end of that evening, and as a result of some Google searches, I found my way to a website called AmRen.com. I read a handful of the articles near the top of the page, as well as some of the comments. I quickly became hooked. My eyes had been opened to a wealth of hidden information, stories, and statistics. But more than that, my entire perspective on life changed that night. With one major jolt, I had completed the transformation into the realm of race realism. Indeed, my life has never been the same since.</p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My Life as a Race Realist</span></strong></p>
<p>In the final stages of my racial awakening, a little-known black Senator from Illinois announced he would  run for US President. As Barack Obama&rsquo;s association with his pastor Jeremiah Wright became national news, I called my father in a panic. He is a devout Republican, and said I shouldn&rsquo;t worry that Mr. Obama might become president, since his poll numbers had plummeted in the wake of the Jeremiah Wright revelations. We know how that turned out.</p>
<p>For various reasons I spent 2009 in South America. Although I was living in a country with few blacks and a much lower homicide rate than the United States, I was robbed three times and severely beaten once. I was clearly singled out because of my white skin and because of the assumption that I was from the United States. Needless to say, this only strengthened my views on the importance of race. I became certain that race would inform virtually every decision I make in life going forward.</p>
<p>I now live a calculated, careful life because of my beliefs. I am cautious about what I say and who I say it to. At work, I mute my observations in order to keep my job. This is all the more necessary because I work in the same office as a black man. On the streets, I am always on guard.</p>
<p>In my first months as a race realist, I started investigating which US cities were the most dangerous, and which had the highest percentage of blacks. Now, I look at the racial breakdowns of census tracts, and avoid black and Hispanic neighborhoods whenever possible. I pore over homicide maps, police alerts, and city body counts. I work in a city that is half black, and I never go into <em>that</em> part of town. I have a concealed carry permit and I carry my pistol wherever and whenever I can.</p>
<p>I have met and become friends with like-minded white men and women, with whom I can speak my mind. I have learned that everybody has his own story on how he became conscious of race. I met one man who started down the road to race realism because he was beaten by a group of blacks, but he and I are exceptions. The overwhelming majority came to their conclusions through observation, because they were raised that way, or through a combination of both. Though I haven&rsquo;t met another white racialist who was converted by a black-on-white shooting, I&rsquo;m sure there are people like that out there, and I would love to find them.</p>
<p>I am fortunate to have a girlfriend who understands my outlook, and though she is not as committed or outspoken as I am, she supports me and rarely takes issue with what I have to say. I also discuss race with my parents, and though I sometimes make them a bit uncomfortable, they are willing to listen.</p>
<p>Like most race realists, I live a life not very different from that of Winston in George Orwell&rsquo;s <em>1984</em>. I try to help others see the light. I worry about the safety of my brothers, sister, cousins, parents, grandparents, and friends. I try to use my experience to help them avoid what happened to me. I wonder if they will ever understand, and see the world as I do.</p>
<p>I am not John Sanderson. I am not Marley Lion. I am not Jason Befort. You probably do not know those names, but they were all killed by blacks. I <em>am</em> fortunate to be alive. My white racial identity will always play a major role in my life, and the preservation of the white race is my ultimate goal.</p>
<p>None of this would have happened, had it not been for those two black men who helped me see the truth back in 2006.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-110843" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>In 1980 while spending a work week at my org&rsquo;s HQ in New York city, I was returning  from a movie to my hotel  (Tudor Arms) on 42nd street, and I had crossed over from 40th by one of those narrow ally-like cross streets when I noticed am idling car parked across from my side of the street and two black heads inside. They were obviously blacks. Then as walked I also saw that the car was slowly rolling backward along the direction I was walking..then I saw something else the rear car door was not closed. Immediatly, I knew I was being set up for a mugging and I turned and sprinted back the way I came. At once the idling car sped off in the opposite dirction.  I thus escaped them and got safely to the hotel. It was about 10.30 at night. </p>
<p>A year earlier on the borders of Catholic University in DC my eldest daughter was mugged outside a 7-11 at about 9 PM when she came out of the story carrying a purchase. She was attacked by a black as she unlocked her car. The black was cheered on by a mixed  chorus of blacks at the corner  shouting &#8220;kill the white bitch&#8221;.  She was saved by a car load of white male students who saw the attack and piled out of thire car and rushed her car and frightened off the black. He stole her watch, a ring and tore her ear lobe getting an earring. It could have been much, much worse if the attacker had not been driven off.  </p>
<p>These are the only criminal acts every attempted or executed against me and my family in the states.  In all three African countries I worked in in the 80s, I narrowly escaped being murdered by blacks. But those are other tales for another time.</p>

I have never experienced violence from them (well, some menacing), but loads and loads of UNWARRANTED, UNPROVOKED  hostile comments, disrespectful glares and attitudes and drama-starting, &#8220;only whites can be racist&#8221; /&#8221;whites don&rsquo;t have a culture&#8221;/&#8221;blacks invented everything in ancient egypt&#8221; and phoney/distorted/left-wing versions of history, double standards galore, a frustrating inability to understand how whites and I personally felt about certain issues, a frustrating inability to admit their cultural group short-comings and statistical realities (despite me throwing them bones on their group&rsquo;s strength, for example blacks and music, blacks are in such DENIAL  about the stats on race/crime/etc, even most of the bright/decent ones, which is sickening in and of itself), inability to be fair-minded and give whites/europeans credit where credit it do, their general learned and taught creepy jealousy and enmity towards whites. This after I tried to be kind, friendly, tolerant, understanding and go out of my way to respect and understand and befriend them. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even worse when &#8220;friends&#8221; of other races behave this way than strangers. Imagine?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrifying psychologically waking up and realizing your &#8220;friend&#8221; (to a lesser or greater extent) views you as THE ENEMY because you are some form of &#8220;white&#8221;. </p>
<p>Blacks are generally too dumb to sort through and understand the real history of slavery, america, different white ethnic groups, etc. This is yet another weakness that makes them susceptible to dumbed down/simplistic &#8220;whites killed the native americans and enslaved blacks therefore I have a right to hate them/get revenge on them&#8221; etc thinking. </p>
<p>&#8220;White liberal&#8221;, &#8220;I grew up poor too&#8221;, different white ethnic group histories and struggles, or even their own self-induced problems like single parenting and out of wedlocking consequences, all of that is lost on blacks&hellip;</p>
<p>They know about &#8220;white people&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s it.</p>

I feel I&rsquo;ve lead this incredible life with so many racial experiences with all of the racial groups to share with others that have made me wise beyond belief, and understand and shed light on things in ways most people can&rsquo;t. I feel like some sort of reverse anthropologist.  I suffered for those experiences, so they might as well get put to good use&hellip; other people might as well learn of them, no matter how un-pretty they may be or sound.</p>
<p> Because I earn my bread outside the corporate world, I have the luxury of doing so, which impels me even more.</p>
<p>I see it as my MORAL OBLIGATION not to LIE about my experiences with race in life, unless like at a job or such.  </p>
<p>I also feel with the impending downfall of Europe and the US, there is no more stalling time left. We have no choice but to stand up and act and work for change NOW. What is more important than the downfall of Western Civilization? What is more important than Europe, our real homeland (like I said, America is indeed up for debate and harder to defend as being euro-based, although I do understand and promote those arguments) being submerged in hostile muslims? </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more important than us being turned into a minority group?</p>

<p>Also, AR readers might want to consider that perhaps Sheila,&#8221; by urging us to use our real names, is doing so in order to expose individuals for harrassment or reporting purposes, etc. I&rsquo;m not sure about this, but I would be very cautious. If one wishes to use their real name, that&rsquo;s their right and I admire their willingness to be open about it. But not all of us can do it yet for personal and professional reasons.  </p>

This is the transcript from the only living survivor of the Wichita Massacre. I stumbled across it purely by accident years ago, because I had never heard of a Wichita Massacre. I wondered why the media would hide such an atrocity. Now, I don&rsquo;t wonder. In this transcript, the survivor, as she is being raped, tells how one of the attackers&rsquo; guns was sitting on the floor by her hand. She did not pick it up. We have become so programmed, that we have given up our instinct to survive. That&rsquo;s what this is about. It is about power, about programming the mind through manipulation to deaden even the most basic of natural instincts. Here is the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://library.flawlesslogic.com/wichita_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://library.flawlesslogic.com/wichita_2.htm</a></p>

<p><a href="http://library.flawlesslogic.com/wichita.htm" rel="nofollow">http://library.flawlesslogic.com/wichita.htm</a></p>
<p>Years ago, as I was trying to research information on this crime,  I found myself browsing through forbidden, &#8220;racist&#8221;, &#8220;nazi&#8221; sites. I was ashamed at first, and then I came to realize that these sites were the only place to find certain race-related stories. That is how the powers that be want us to feel. They bury stories, and force us to feel ashamed if we try to look where they do not want us to look. Now, I don&rsquo;t care. I get my news from these &#8220;dirty&#8221; sites as effortlessly as I read the other news sites. I came across Amren and agreed with what I read and I have been a loyal follower ever since. Before, I was a mild-mannered guy, just trying to get through life. Now, I&rsquo;m pretty much like Bane. </p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve never felt threatened by blacks, their boorish behavior in a confined space is maddening.</p>
<p>Black women on cell phones; the &#8216;cell yell&rsquo;. Even with all the posted notices to keep your voice down while on the phone, black women don&rsquo;t seem to read them or think they apply to them.</p>
<p>Another pet peeve is blacks opening windows on air conditioned buses. Regardless of how hot it is out side and how cool it is on the bus, blacks will walk through the bus opening windows. One memorable experience involved a black couple who got on the bus. The woman sat down in the air conditioned bus after escaping from the oppressive heat and humidity and announced to all that she was hot so her male companion opened the window for her.</p>
<p>Blacks sitting seats apart and shouting conversations to each other.</p>
<p>As I said, I&rsquo;ve never felt personally threatened by blacks, but when blacks are the majority riders, it&rsquo;s a chaotic mix of shouting and escalating horse play. Once on a bus, out of nowhere, a fight broke out. I didn&rsquo;t even see how it started. It just happened spontaneously. One of the guys opened an emergency window and hopped out.</p>
<p>And regarding Hispanic women. Are they all deaf? The way they shout their conversations in Spanish leads me to believe they are.</p>
<p>When I see white &#8216;talking heads&rsquo; chiding whites for being intolerant of blacks I know they don&rsquo;t ride public transportation.</p>

<p>I also found Bowling for Columbine a seminal experience, in that the mere ability to have an intelligent discussion about race issues was not possible.  (I posted about this a couple of days ago.)</p>
<p>One caveat:  my wife and I live in a neighborhood of small homes, popular with young families just starting out.  Many of our neighbors are blacks that moved out of dangerous neighborhoods when they had kids.  They have ZERO tolerance for drugs or other ghetto pathologies, and appreciate living among stable whites and Asians whose values they want to emulate instead of deprecate.  I do wish AmRen and AmRenners would devote SOME effort to discussing how race denialism hurts blacks themselves.   Some might appreciate that we at least care about unwed parenthood, STDs, alcoholism, workforce non-participation and drug violence.</p>

If Daugherty lives in Baltimore County, then the &#8220;half black&#8221; city he is talking about is probably Baltimore City, which in fact is nearly two-thirds black. The only alternative is Washington, DC, which is 60 percent black. In neither city is there the remotest possibility of being allowed a concealed-carry permit, and even in Baltimore County it is virtually impossible. (Baltimore City is not part of Baltimore County.)

My prior experiences with blacks were with children of professionals and business owners. I was shocked at the intellectual level and behavior, not to mention the sexual maturity of these 10 and 11 year old kids. As I went further in school and college I realized that blacks really didn&rsquo;t like or want to be friends with blacks- other than the black men who wanted to date white girls. After an abusive marriage to a middle eastern man who constantly berated and insulted me about being both white and American I realized that whites were singled out for special abuse no matter how accommodating and kind they were to minorities. </p>

I had several dealings with blacks in the military. In boot camp in Great Lakes the blacks in my division were forgettable except one. There was one angry 18 yr old black who was assigned to the rack above me for about 2 weeks. He was a disgusting kid who picked his nose and butt in front of others. He drew the ire of the RDC&rsquo;s quickly because he was lazy and stupid.  He got recycled because of behavior and performance problems.<br/>
I did not work with any blacks after that in the Navy.  I worked with plenty of great Hispanics, Asians, and other Whites but no blacks.  </p>
<p>AmRem I hope things worked out right for you in your life and I am glad to see that people here are able to come together and be realistic about race. Sure liberals and angry blacks will lie about us and rage on with their inane hate filled rants, but we shall  triumph in the end using our superior minds. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-111217" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I work for an entertainment company that is hired by colleges all over the USA. Of course, when I started, I was the usual brain washed American when it comes to race. Most people are when they start and everyones beliefs follow the same trajectory. The thing is, we get heavy, one on one exposure to black people. This exposure, over time, undoes all of the brainwashing. If you&rsquo;ve seen the video of the black flash/rob mobs in the Walmart and 7&rsquo;11s then you know  EXACTLY what we experience at some colleges. These can be colleges where a small percentage of the student population is black, but when we go there, it seems like ALL of the college is black. The black students hear there is &#8220;free stuff&#8221; being provided by student activities so they take over the event, they aggressively cut in front of the lines, and they walk out with five to ten of each item when there are supposed to be only one per person.<br/>
   On many occasions I have witnessed a line of thirty people that had only one black person in it near the front. That black person then has their friends come up to talk to them and then all of a sudden after a few minutes they pretend they are now in line, then this happens again and again until the same twenty or so white people stand there for up to a couple hours sometimes.None of them are willing to speak up and back me if I ask them if people are cutting in line, they are afraid of retribution later.<br/>
      After awhile at some schools the white people don&rsquo;t bother to go to the &#8220;student activities&#8221; programs anymore. THAT is when things get REALLY bad because the behavior of the blacks doesn&rsquo;t change in this regard, but they do start fighting amongst themselves. It is absolutely AMAZING that a simple student activity day, where people wait in line for silly items, has to turn into a melee . It is amazing that some people have to get as many of these silly dust collectors as they can possibly scam. It also amazes me that when they are told they already were in line and ordered one that they have to try to scam me with &#8220;dat was fo mah fehhn, dat wasn&rsquo;t fo me!&#8221; To which I reply, &#8220;you already ordered one, you are only allowed to get one&#8221; and they come back again with &#8220;but dat wasn&rsquo;t fo me!, dat was fo my frehn!&#8221; <br/>
     Then of course there is always the issue of the event ending, and it is time for us to leave. White people seem to be able to figure out that if there is one guy doing a program and there is only an hour left, then it&rsquo;s probably not a good idea to get into a line that is already 30 people deep. Not blacks though. I have seen events where there was ONE novelty artist with only a half hour left to go and that is when fifty black people decide to try to get into a line that they didn&rsquo;t cut into before. Then I have seen all hell break lose when they are told that the line is cut off. I am talking major chimpouts, extreme anger and screaming and accusations of racism even though everyone before them in line that had been served was black. <br/>
    It doesn&rsquo;t take long for a reasonably intelligent person to notice the IMMENSE difference of our job experience depending on the color of the crowd. It also doesn&rsquo;t take long to despise the stupidity and the greed of these people . One sees that even if one is dealing with the &#8220;nice&#8221; black person, they STILL try to pull the same scams. They ALWAYS try to micromanage the creation of their item and get as much ridiculous crap as possible. If it is an airbrushed &#8220;t-shirt&#8221; where they are just supposed to get one word, then they ask for five, and then they wait until their order is up and then bother the artist by telling them exactly which word goes where, diagonal, across, down up, etc, and then asking for images, even their portrait. The purpose of limiting what each person gets is to serve as many people as possible. This is not possible though when each person tries to maximize what they get on their item. And when they ALL do it the even becomes unmanageable.There is though ONE instance when things get even WORSE STILL! That is when the person running the program is black and tries to pull the same scams. They pretend they don&rsquo;t know that the contract explicitly states that what the artist does is limited to one word on each item. I have had one such administrator come to me at the beginning of the program and demand I do several celebrity portrait t-shirts for all of her friends. This would require a good portion of the time we are there at the job and would mean we would not be able to serve many, if any, students. In other words, she was jacking the program for her own personal use. Then, when the students started chimping out in a 7-11 flash rob fashion, she went and hid.<br/>
   It never fails though, every new person that comes in has the same old lame excuses for such behavior, but after a short time, all of that falls away and they have to face a reality that they had tried desperately not to face. To face that reality means that they would have to jettison their brainwashing, and their brainwashing has taught them that anyone who isn&rsquo;t brainwashed is &#8220;BAD&#8221;.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter, reality is stronger than brainwashing every time and they all admit in the end &#8220;black people are not &#8216;just like&rsquo; us&#8221;, and &#8220;I want to be as far away from them as I possibly can&#8221;<br/>
  oh, BTW there is also the issue simple literacy. We encounter people who can not speak intelligible english, and we find that if they need to fill out an order form that they can not read nor write, yet they are in a COLLEGE, and they are getting a DEGREE, and that degree is absolutely worthless because they were not held to the basic minimum standards to get IN and we know they won&rsquo;t be held to any standards at all to get out with a degree.</p>

<p>I grew up in a non-racist home where my parents never said anything bad about blacks or used offensive words. I watched the TV shows and thought blacks were either funny clowns in comedies or the tragic victims of racial injustice. I used to feel sad watching the TV shows or movies in which a single, black mother scrubbed long hallways on her hands and knees to earn money to hire a lawyer to defend her innocent son who was railroaded by racist cops and a racist justice system.</p>
<p>When I was in junior high and high school, I had black friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>When I went away to college, I started to see blacks as they really are; many of them shiftless con artists playing a scam. <br/>
 <br/>
The more contact I had with blacks, the less I saw of the old TV shows and movies and I began to see blacks in the real world.<br/>
 <br/>
My original acceptance of blacks was based on ignorance. My racial awareness is now firmly based in personal experience.</p>
<p>The more I&rsquo;m around blacks, the less I want to be around blacks.</p>
<p>As I said before, any white person who tells me blacks are just like me doesn&rsquo;t ride the bus.</p>

<p>As for me&hellip;<br/>
I never really got involved with either side on race, but I did follow along with mainstream i.e. left-wing ideals, and I had pity on illegal Mestizos and wanted to help the Black Africans and &#8220;feel important&#8221;.</p>
<p>Around my third year of high school in early 2009, I was looking for stories on illegal immigrants and racism stories for entertainment.  I eventually found out about groups called MEChA, the Mexica Movement, and NCLR.</p>
<p>I was surprised to learn that the concerns about Mestizos taking over the U.S wasn&rsquo;t just some false right-wing invented myth.  It was a true conspiracy.</p>
<p>Things just kinda took off from there.<br/>
I was confused, I had many questions, and I researched different sites and looked for answers.<br/>
I eventually found this place.</p>
<p>One notable incident was when I found Newsweek&rsquo;s news issue with the &#8220;White babies are racist&#8221; article on the front, in my school library.</p>
<p>I was <b>fuming</b> mad, but I was afraid to try to complain about it. <br/>
After all, acknowledging anti-White racism is hate speech.</p>

My mother&rsquo;s father on the other hand would be quite loud and open about his racial attitudes. I remember hearing something like this quite often when we visited &#8220;GOD D**N IT! CHANGE THE CHANNEL! A GOD D**N N****R IS ON THE TV!! I am quite sure that my mother and her mother hated my grandfather, and since attitudes were changing they thought they could use this criteria to vilify him. The truth about my grandfather is that he spent years as a salesman and had an abundant amount of exposure to black people. His attitudes were born of brutal experience. His wife and daughter had no exposure to black people, so all they saw was his anger and resentment, and let&rsquo;s face it, that can turn people off. But his anger was justified, his assessment of black people was dead on the money. I was actually taught to hate him as I was growing up, in subtle ways and in not so subtle ways. I believe now that on some level, many wives hate their husbands, and they transfer that hate to their children, and that is how we have arrived where we are today. Liberalism is in some sense a hatred of white males and the common sense that they possessed a couple of generations ago.  My generation was taught to hate my grandfather and his attitudes, but life experience has shown me that he was a good man, he provided for his family, he was honest, hard working, and he cared deeply about the survival of his people and his values. He rightly saw the threat that black people pose to the things he loved. I see now that he was right, and I love him now more than my own father who was weak and let my mother dictate the rules of the house.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-112213" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You are absolutely correct. My tale of racial awakening is much the same. I grew up in a great upstate NY college town where you could count the number of blacks on one hand. I had almost no real contact with blacks until leaving home at 18. After that a steady dose of black bad behavior drove me to where I am today; race realism.<br/>
The liberal notion that people&rsquo;s dislike of ethnic minorities is the result of &#8216;ignorance&rsquo; is one of the most obviously stupid concepts to ever emerge from sociology. The reason white southerners and white South Africans had laws restricting black civil rights is because they knew all about blacks and their savagery. </p>

I had to wait in the parking lot in a bad area while my friend texted me back with what she wanted, so I was alone in a dark parking lot for a few minutes. I kept my motor running, so I could make a quick escape, I locked my doors, and kept scanning the area for any movement, looking out for nonwhites. I even had a plan in my head that if someone blocked my car with theirs, I would just put it in reverse and drive through them-my point being that I feel and act as though I&rsquo;m living in a combat zone. I live in Southern California and have lived here all my life. My family is in the process of moving from Los Angeles, which is 80% hispanic among other things, to an area that is 97% White. It&rsquo;s just amazing what we have to do to keep safe, to stay alive. A simple outing to the store shouldn&rsquo;t have to be a dangerous mission. I wish I lived in a world where I could just enjoy my life. Our barbaric friends make that an impossible dream.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-111242" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I thought much about when I had my racial awakening. While I could never be sure, I rememember the first time I ever met a black. It was when I was between the ages of 6 and 8. I believe this incident really had an effect on me.</p>
<p>My father had taken my brothers and me to a beach. When we got to the beach, I noticed that there were black kids everywhere. I noticed that my father was looking around and he did not look too comfortable. However, since he drove us to this beach, he decided we should stay.</p>
<p>I was in the water, by myself (I don&rsquo;t remember how I got separated from my brothers), when a black boy, around my age, started swimming towards me. I knew from the look on his face I was in trouble. </p>
<p>At one point he stopped, glared at me, and actually said to me &#8220;What are YOU people doing in the same water with us?&#8221;. I was terrified but admittedly I honestly did not understand what he meant by &#8220;you people.&#8221; However, he kept on giving me that stare, that angry black stare that so many White people have received throughout the years since integration. I was terrified.</p>
<p>Thankfully, my father was yelling at me to get out of the water and this gave me a chance to get away from this anti-White black kid. I sometimes think that if my father did not call me, I would have stood in the water and this black kid would have drowned me. I will never forget the hateful glare he kept giving me.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-111277" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> Great topic.</p>
<p>I was never left wing on race.  As I was growing up, my mother (*) and various uncles and aunts (remember, one of my uncles was a firefighter often deployed to the Pruitt-Igoes) sat me on their knees and taught me the facts of life about &#8220;them.&#8221;  And that there were times to tell the truth and times to keep your mouth shut and play dumb.</p>
<p>For a few years as a young adult, I had kinda sorta neo-connish Rush Limbaugh-style racial politics.  I was hardly a &#8220;lover,&#8221; (insert the first word on your own), but I had the mentality that blacks could have been better off than they are, even if not equal to whites,  with better and more &#8220;conservative&#8221; public policy.  </p>
<p>All those delusions were out of my mind by the age of 20, for various reasons:  One, the power of observation, two, my brain starting to hard-wire properly, and three, my discovering the CofCC thanks to two certain radio shows on WGNU&rsquo;s old format.</p>
<p>As the years have passed on, I am getting less intensely ideological in the abstract and more purely racial in the concrete.</p>
<p>For those of you who missed me, I&rsquo;m on my way home.  For those of you who don&rsquo;t, rejoice, because election day is in two weeks and change, and until then, I&rsquo;ll be burning a two-ended candle at three ends, or firing my V-8 on all ten cylinders, so I&rsquo;ll still have little time for AR.  </p>
<p>(*) - Yet, this is the same mother whom I couldn&rsquo;t talk out of supporting Herman Cain for President, even after the &#8220;allegations&#8221; came out.  And this mother of mine is someone who puts up with absolutely zero nonsense from any man   &mdash;   There was no way she would have put up with Cain&rsquo;s shenanigans if she was one of his immediate subordinates.  Yet, when I say this to her, it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m not there.  My powers of persuasion are poor indeed.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-111284" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good for you!! Well, you got your wish. My name is Tyron Robert Parsons. I first started to see the light when I served on the Czech border in Germany during the cold war. My infantry unit NCO&rsquo;s were almost all black. Several were black panthers and black panther sympathizers. They persecuted us white soldiers relentlessly with excessive physical punishments- death threats, stealing our pay topped off with made up charges against us so we could not advance in rank. I was their prime target because I was white and from the &#8220;evil&#8221; state of Arizona where Evan Mecham tried to get ride of the MLK holiday, something I defended. The persecutions became so bad after a couple years that I was able to obtain an early honorable discharge in exchange for my silence from my CO. I did not remain silent though. Once I got my papers I was protected so another white soldier and I called the IG which precipitated an investigation and trial. At the end of the trial 4 black NCO&rsquo;s were booted from the military and our Black Platoon Sgt sent to the Berlin Brigade with all the other loonies.</p>
<p>When I got back to America I was so happy. I decided to hitchhike to Myrtle Beach after completing my outprocessing. When 2 blacks in a small two door car approached to offer me a ride, I accepted because after all &#8220;I was no racist&#8221; and what happened to me in the military must have simply been a fluke. I quickly learned different. These 2 blacks drove me to a horrible neighborhood, stuck a straight edged razor to my throat and stold half of my seperation pay. They then beat me and kicked me out of the car. After they drove off I could barely catch my breath. I was shaking terribly. An old black man in his 90s sat by me as I awaited a taxi cab. He told me something that forever changed my life. He said &#8220;are you insane whie boy? Don&rsquo;t you know where you are? Black folks will kill you white boy if they sees you in dis neighborhood. You are luck your not dead so I wills protect you. You just sits right here next to me until that cab of your arrives&#8221;. Instantly, I was converted to a race realist and saw my experiences for the first time in a truthful light. Thanks to my experiences with blacks in the military I have been diagnosed with PTSD. Your not alone buddy and I applaud your speaking up.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-112138" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What you say about your Army experiences track well with mine, and many stories I&rsquo;ve heard from whites who served, especially in the 70s and into the early 80s. In Germany things were, if anything, worse than stateside, and Korea was a warzone.  Everywhere I was stationed, the commanders would do nothing about simple racial intimidation &amp; beatings of whites by gangs of blacks. OTOH, when drugs were involved, commanders would act under the protective cover of the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; to prosecute and break up black drug gangs, who as their main tactic (besides murder) routinely beat up and shook down white soldiers. </p>
<p>Things got better in the 80s, when the &#8220;Reagan recession&#8221; of 81 -82 began to bring in a lot of high quality and often highly educated but unemployed whites into the ranks, but the problem of black NCOs - who know they have a good thing, and a position of power over whites - has never been really solved, and won&rsquo;t be, except in elite units where the mission is too important to allow blacks to run amok.</p>
<p>A very interesting book could be written about Army race relations, but a truthful one never will be written, because it would be too politically incorrect and &#8220;racist&#8221; to get published.  Another horror story of black savagery that the American public will never know about.</p>

<p>I have a different experience. Most of the comments I see are race realist. For every braindead white liberal comment, I see 5-10 race realist replies. I even see such comments on British publications.  There used to be more black racist comments, but it seems like those are being filtered&hellip;the liberals don&rsquo;t want us to see what blacks really think of whites. Although it enrages me to read such comments, I wish they would keep them posted. Such comments are what really wakes people up to reality. </p>

I also see mostly race realist comments.  There is some thought on population and ideas, that is that if 10 % of the population strongly believes something, they can win over many others at certain point.  </p>
<p>I believe that the effect of race realism of policy construction ARE slowly going to begin to result in more rational and helpful public policy.  Before this happens though, the current stock of crazy egalitarians will have to run out their last crazy plans  and writings that expose their utter ridiculousness.   The &#8220;Un-Fair Campaign&#8221; of Duluth MI, and the insane behavior of Eric Holder&rsquo;s Justice Department are the last manifestations of this bizarre egalitarian idea.  </p>
<p>Basically, if all ethnic groups are equal in cognitive ability, than it follows that all differences in achievement must be due to discrimination.  This view is certainly not held by most people, and never was.  However, this egalitarian view was held by enough people, that the extremely RELIGIOUS of the egalitarians came to hold power and voice.    </p>
<p>So when we fight the last battles with the egalitarians, we will be fighting the fundamentalist egalitarians, and the not-so-smarts.  <b>Fundies and dummies, these will be the last egalitarian holdouts.  </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-111469" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The question is not whether Black-against-White crime is real, but what can we do about it.  Mr. Daugherty writes proudly, and justifiably so, that he has a permit to carry a concealed handgun.  But if he ever uses that gun on a black man, the chances are he will end up in George Zimmerman&rsquo;s highly unenviable position.  The time was when a man who shot an attacker on the streets would not even be arrested.  Now the chances are that any shooting in self-defense (if interracial, white against black) will be treated as a sensational &#8220;hate crime.&#8221;  We cannot blame the courts and the lawyers for this  &mdash;  because the courts and lawyers just do what&rsquo;s &#8220;politically correct&#8221; and economically beneficial to them, and it&rsquo;s the population at large which determines such things.  We need a restoration of both politics and justice to the majority, to the people, and one step in that direction would clearly be to increase individual self-reliance and decrease dependence not only on the courts and legal system but on the police as the guarantors of our safety.  The people need to guarantee their own safety.  <br/>
I&rsquo;m obviously quite a bit older than Mr. Daugherty but I recall in my college days my complete infatuation with a girl who carried a (back then they were all unlicensed&hellip;.) small handgun (aka &#8220;Saturday night special&#8221;) in her purse with her on dates and to class and in fact every where she went.  She was an expert markswoman (captain of the Sophie Newcomb Skeet &amp; Trap shooting team in New Orleans in fact).  She was as safe as anyone could be.  She never worried about going anywhere at any time, and she knew how to call a spade a spade&hellip;. <br/>
I suppose I loved her because she reminded me of my grandmother, who died at the age of 101 with her six shooter in her nightstand beside her bed, right next to her Bible and Book of Common Prayer.<br/>
Probably the best solution would be that every adult receive gun-practice and safety training in high school and that every adult be required to carry a gun at all times (unless they are blind, otherwise disabled, or under indictment or on parole or something).   Switzerland has universal gun ownership and the crime rate there is negligible.  I think laws should generally be modified to state that the first responsibility for public safety lies with every individual.  The police should look very askance at the report of crime by any  able-bodied person who was NOT carrying a gun when attacked.  <br/>
Much the same could be said for divorce.  No marriage should be granted nor any divorce entered unless the couple enters into a written contract  &mdash;  and the exclusive role of a divorce court should be to construe and apply the contract  &mdash;  again this harkens back to an ancient tradition, in which there was no &#8220;free love&#8221; because everybody knew the value of creating a family far exceeded any other contract you could make.<br/>
If everyone could just take responsibility for their own lives, and pride in their own existence, crime would clearly go way down  &mdash;  I suppose it will never completely vanish.  But would Mr. Daugherty really have had the gruesome experiences he had if his attackers had believed he was likely to be armed and dangerous?  I think not.  And if people who are attacked could shoot without fear of prosecution for hate crimes, would people be likely to attack them?  <br/>
The world seems to have gone mad, but up to a point we have only ourselves to blame&hellip;. It was not black voters who elected first Dwight Eisenhower, who appointed Earl Warran as Chief Justice, and then Lyndon Johnson, whose &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; reforms created the late 1960s explosion in black-against-white crime  &mdash;  back then, the electorate was predominately white, and should have known better.  And in 2008, it was STILL a predominantly white electorate who (if we believe they really count the votes at all these days) elected not only Barack Hussein Obama but also the Senate and House of Representatives who eventually, in December of 2011, all but officially repealed the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution by adding the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act  &mdash;  Senate Bill 1867) to the Patriot Act of 2001 and the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 which effectively abolished the writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>People no longer take responsibility for anything. Young women get pregnant and then simply abort, several times sometimes. And the man who impregnated the woman tries to flee from his responsibility any way he can, leaving the woman for good if she decides to keep the baby. </p>
<p>That´s what liberalism/marxism is all about. They degenerate the youth and nothing more.<br/>
Anyone supporting the liberals/marxists also is sppporting that.<br/>

<p>There was a black student who had shown some interest in the girl I was dating, and that didn&rsquo;t sit well with me. Driving in the car with her, I noticed him walking across one of the streets onto campus. Struck by a bit of rage, I blurted out a certain racial profanity, and my then-girlfriend quickly let me know that my comment was unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incident you endured was very unfortunate. I would not wish such a horrific atrocity on anyone, that being said.  it appears that you were/are a very self indulgent person struggling with many private demons. Hopefully, at some point, you will engage  in some deep reflection and soul searching. Hopefully, at some point, one day, the bullet that is still logded in your body can successfully be removed.</p>

<p>American Renaissance&rsquo;s professional and non-militant approach has broadened our message&rsquo;s appeal beyond yesteryear&rsquo;s social outcasts.

I have seen what black people are capable of and its only possible if you lack this basic emotion. Imagine dancing around a burning body, or stoning that person as he burns. I have seen this and cant unsee it. That happens EVERY day in South Africa.</p>
<p>73 children are raped per day here because our brethren believe it cures AIDS.</p>
<p>By the way the person has to be burned alive the stones and rocks may not be thrown at the head only the legs.</p>

<p>I also saw some blacks, so dumb, they had to be discharged.  Someone had obviously taken the ASVAB test for them.   Couldn&rsquo;t learn the most basic tasks in boot-camp and had to be put out.   </p>
<p>I THINK the Army actually has a lower standard for the ASVAB than the Marines.    </p>
<p>BTW, the ASVAB  breaks out almost exactly the same way the SAT does.   Whites and Asians on top, Hispanics in the middle, Blacks on the bottom. </p>

<p>My racial awakening came on the mean streets of Detroit and began around 1967.</p>
<p>We had to move out of our home in 1967 since the riots were too close.</p>
<p>Moved farther from blacks, but not far enough. </p>
<p>In elementary school, I witnessed a black kid, named Tyrone stab a white kid.</p>
<p>My dad was robbed at gunpoint by blacks. </p>
<p>My mom had her purse snatched by blacks. </p>
<p>Brother assaulted by blacks.</p>
<p>I was also assaulted by blacks while minding my own business.  </p>
<p>Busing destroyed my school the my neighborhood.</p>
<p>Was driven out of every neighborhood I ever lived it.  Blacks ran us out.</p>
<p>I read reports of  whites murdered by blacks nearly weekly in the metro area.  </p>
<p>When I retire I am moving to Southeastern Kentucky.  NO blacks for miles and miles.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-113909" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Several years ago, I had a conversation with a retired police officer for the L.A. Housing Authority Police Department (it&rsquo;s now been disbanded). I asked how it was working in the various L.A. projects with all the Mexicans and Blacks. He just shook his head and said, &#8220;It&rsquo;s a bean dip.&#8221; He essentially described the Blacks as worthless savages, and said the Mexicans had so taken over the city that he felt at times like he was in Central Mexico (which he almost was). He had absolutely nothing good to say about them. He also seemed saddened and defeated by the Mexican invasion he had witnessed for the past 30 years.  </p>

Blacks for the most part do NOT serve in combat arms. I served for 6 years in the Navy. I worked in the security of sensitive areas &amp; personnel.  I did not work with blacks and I was happt for the most part, yet I wanted to push myself more. Since I had my degree by then I went into the Marine Corps. I graduated OCS then went through a series of other schools.  When I had nothing left and wanted to quit the thing that got me through was this.<br/>
I did not want to command lazy blacks who hated me, hated their job, and had no pride. Knowing that if I gave up or did not pass is what really pushed me when I had nothing left. </p>
<p>Of course like a &#8220;good American&#8221; I have always said it was not giving up on my brothers. Truth I just did not want to work with the Brothers. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-114104" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yes, in the seventies the media started pumping out n***** propaganda, and yes, soon every show had to either be about them or have one of them in it.I have seen an analysis of this and it&rsquo;s evolution over time on a different site. It was a very good read. Basically, they started out with somewhat realistic portrayals, as in &#8220;Good Times&#8221;, &#8220;Sanford and Son&#8221; and &#8220;What&rsquo;s Happenin&#8221;. I say &#8220;somewhat&#8221; realistic because they portrayed them as existing in  lower economic circumstance and they were shown to be of average and below average intelligence. They were NOT shown to be violent and criminal though, they were made to be cute, funny and likeable. Then came &#8220;The Jeffersons&#8221; and we were then supposed to believe they were capable entrepreneurs, if still rather ignorant. Then came &#8220;the Cosby Show&#8221;, which is a total fantasy world where every black person is a genius and every white person is depicted as a fool. Movies followed the same path. today, a black person is the noble hero, genius, while the white person is the criminal, fool, or sexually violent killer. It is so far removed from the everyday reality we all experience and is at complete odds with what everyone can now see on youtube. Do you realize what total control the media used to have? Do you realize that if they still had that control we would never hear stories of these &#8220;flash robberies&#8221; let alone see the videos? The tide has already turned my friend. The libs have lost this war, it just is not apparent yet.</p>

You decide. I was threatened to be shot by some smug hoodlum (maybe he was a wanabe? I don&rsquo;t know) apparently just for looking at him the wrong way (while I was on my way home with my white Jewish friend, minding our own business). I didn&rsquo;t see the gun, as he had his hand in his coat pocket (which was large enough to conceal a small firearm), although I saw a decent sized knife sheathed in his pocket. By the way, I&rsquo;am Hispanic American. I don&rsquo;t know if this was race related. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t. The main point of my story begs this simple question: was this merely a coincidence?</p>

They would enter screaming greetings at the top of their lungs and speaking to each other at a decibel level required to reach someone 100 yards away, instead of the 12 inches they were actually separated. I noticed this did not occur when white, Native American, or a Hispanic person entered. It was such a consistent happening with blacks that I entered the phrase, &#8220;Why are black people so loud in public places,&#8221; into my search engine. A world of information  &mdash;  not the least of which is black on white violence  &mdash;  was opened up to me.</p>

<p>Also, Canada isn&rsquo;t as violence-free any more as this article may suggest.  Yes, Canadians tend to have long-guns, especially people in rural areas and the north.    But illegal handguns are making their way in like they never have before, and usually wind up in the hands of ETHNIC GANGS, who then proceed to turn our once-quiet cities into battlegrounds.  There was just a truckload of handguns stopped at the border crossing nearest me a couple of weeks ago.  Wonder who they were destined for, hmmm?</p>
