	                	<p>Since the mid-1960s the federal government has tried to eliminate the black underclass. These are the folk who rarely work, and survive thanks to welfare. They are prone to criminality, illegitimacy, mayhem, drug addiction, and illiteracy, among countless other intractable pathologies. We are not speaking of African Americans generally, but perhaps the bottom 20 percent of all native-born blacks, though some would put this figure higher.</p>
<p>The cost to society of this underclass far exceeds the billions spent on futile remediation, though that is bad enough. Its presence makes countless cities (and now even suburbs) virtually unlivable for millions of whites <em>and</em> blacks. And matters seemingly grow worse as cities such as Philadelphia and New Orleans edge toward becoming the next East Saint Louis or Detroit.</p>
<p>So, given that every conventional, expensive intervention over the last half century has failed &mdash; perhaps even exacerbated matters &mdash; what&rsquo;s Plan B? Let us begin by recognizing that a successful Plan B must have three characteristics. First, black leaders must accept it, so anything that smacks of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; or reduces material benefits is DOA. Second, the plan must be cheaper than present futile efforts but without requiring riot-generating cold turkey. Finally, it must be politically feasible (even for skinflint Republicans), consistent with mainstream political values, and be possible to implement relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Plan B exists. In brief, Congress needs to pass an updated version of P.L. 103-66, which President Clinton signed into law on August 10th, 1993. This act, popularly known as the Empowerment Act of 1993, set up a ten-year trial for urban and rural &ldquo;Empowerment Zones&rdquo; that would (supposedly) reduce poverty by attracting businesses to underclass areas via tax breaks, tax-exempt bond financing, accelerated property depreciation, loan guarantees, and social services. Needless to say, everything failed. Atlanta, for example, squandered millions concocting fantasy plans for hi-tech industrial parks. Few employers took the bait, and the chief beneficiaries were bureaucrats and community organizers who were supposed to be transforming the underclass into decent employees.</p>
<p>Our Plan B uses this rhetoric only as window dressing. It is impossible to eliminate the underclass but its impact can be mitigated by concentrating it. So, instead of dozens of cities troubled by a disorderly underclass, let us relocate it to just a handful of cities. Let flash mobs attack each other. Concentration reduces administrative overhead while cutting crime and mayhem in those places the underclass leaves behind. The trick is to persuade millions of people to move. How could that be done?</p>
<p>Under the &ldquo;2012 Urban Relocation and Development Act,&rdquo; Washington would buy up vacant houses in just a few already underclass-dominated cities and give them away to anyone willing to put sweat equity into them &mdash; in effect, free housing. Washington would pay the local real estate tax and moving expenses, and offer a weekly cash bonus to help these newly minted &ldquo;urban pioneers&rdquo; adjust to their new environment. There would be low-interest loans for housing rehabilitation, and local workers would get a strong preference for the construction jobs. Churches and other community organizations would, for a fee, administer the work, but the checks themselves would be government issued to minimize stealing. Unskilled locals would be trained at government expense and receive a &ldquo;training wage.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_98821" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 586px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Ghetto.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-98821" title="Ghetto" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Ghetto.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="432"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Badly in need of &quot;urban pioneers.&quot;</p></div>
<p>Cities such as Detroit and East Saint Louis, which we would expect to be included in the Urban Relocation and Development Act, would be revitalized by newly arrived, cash-flush residents. Vast tracts of now desolate urban American would be rebuilt, or would at least have lots of activity that resembled a construction boom. Abandoned schools would be fixed up and hold classes again, closed stores would re-open, and the city payroll would explode.</p>
<p>Financially this program would be a wash, since no new funding would be required. Money now spent in, say, San Francisco, would be spent in Detroit instead.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there is nothing about this program that is &ldquo;racial,&rdquo; though I&rsquo;d predict that nearly all transplants would be black. Who else would want to move to Camden, NJ? Moreover, and again not explicitly, nearly all the government-created jobs would go to African Americans; city residence could be a job requirement. The act would also be an electoral windfall for would-be black office holders since population increase means more political fiefdoms and administrative appointments. Democrats would be happy to have more Democratic elected officials, and Republicans would quietly relish the idea of shifting blacks out of their districts to ensure Republican (white) majorities. The days of municipal cut-backs would be over. After all, Newark cannot be turned around on a starvation, short-handed municipal budget. An especially nice feature of the act is that it fits well with the proclivity of African Americans to re-locate to wherever government benefits are greatest.</p>
<p>Will the act reduce the size of the black underclass? No &mdash; schools will still overflow with gangs and drug dealing, and crime will remain as high as ever. This is not about manufacturing a black middle class. But sacrificing a few cities that are already disaster zones would reduce the underclass presence in other areas, and this alone justifies the cost. Cities losing their black underclass would benefit handsomely in reduced education and policing costs, and improved quality of life.</p>
<p>To be sure, further concentrating the black lower class may exacerbate certain pathologies. However, the problems that result from this migration would be problems for underclass blacks and their leaders, not for decent whites and blacks who want to escape the mayhem.</p>

<p>As if I&rsquo;m supposed to be upset about that?  It&rsquo;s just too bad I gave up drinking, otherwise I&rsquo;d have some champagne on ice waiting for the occasion.  99% of the civil unrest the Alex Jones types worry about come from blacks and Hispanics, factor them out and we&rsquo;re basically Sweden (sans its own minorities) but with warmer weather.</p>

<p>Seriously, we need a civilized eugenics program to eliminate (as much as possible) the under class.<br/>
PAY low IQ, troubled, violent people of all races to be sterilized.   And encourage high IQ people to have more kids.  Right now the lowest IQ people have the most kids and the highest IQ people have thefewest kids.  We have to reverse that!  Other than Democrats having their voting base eroded, I honestly can&rsquo;t think of any drawbacks!</p>
<p>We also need to eliminate welfare and replace it with an actual workfare program.   If you cannot find a job in the private sector, and must go on workfare, here is what is expected of you.  </p>
<p>1.   You show up for work each day at 8 AM.  You show up on time and sober or you will be sent home and NOT PAID for that day. </p>
<p>2.  If you have kids, they go to the day care center ran by other people like you.  So, having kids is not an excuse for not working.</p>
<p>3.  Your work will be sweeping streets, raking vacant lots, cutting grass, cleaning up trash, painting houses, tearing down houses that are too far gone to save.  Anything that needs to be done, you will do rain or shine.</p>
<p>4.  You will be paid slightly less than minimum wage which will give you an incentive to GET OFF of workfare.   </p>
<p>5.  If you cause trouble, you go to jail where the work is even harder.  Chronic offenders of law will be sterilized, no choice and no payment for it.   If you don&rsquo;t show up for work each day, you don&rsquo;t get paid.  </p>
<p>6.  Capital punishment is a must.  Some crimes are too terrible to EVER release the individual who did them and taxpayers should not be expected to feed and house them.  If a guy kills people, there are 15 witnesses, it is on video tape and he confessed, do we really need to waste decades on trials and appeals?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really pretty simple.  Reward good behavior and punish bad behavior. </p>

<p>Underclass Blacks will work some time - just not all the time and shouldn&rsquo;t be expected to achieve 1950s suburban affluence, social morals.</p>
<p>The benevolent forms of feudalism with provide underclass Blacks with food and shelter, basic medical care, social activities like sports that don&rsquo;t involve murder and mayhem (boxing, NFL football are OK).</p>
<p>Population control has to be a key component - fertility must be replacement level and nothing more - so the 1970s programs of AFDC Black welfare mothers having 10 children, that has to be ended forever and it looks like great progress has been achieved in this area.</p>
<p>Everyone associated with programs, education of the Black underclass has to become tough but fair, understanding that this demographic group has destroyed every city it has touched. </p>

I have noticed this lately on the race realist front. It isn&rsquo;t so much that you are opposed to paying protection money to a permanent, non-White criminal and dependent underclass, it is just that you&rsquo;d like to possibly pay a little less and in a so-called &#8220;better&#8221; or more efficient way.</p>
<p>To Hell with that! I say not one more welfare handout of bribe or &#8220;gibsmuhdat&#8221; and all the current stuff is abolished.  Cold turkey and lets have the rioting. Bring. It. On. I&rsquo;m prepared for a long, hot nationwide summer. I&rsquo;d say it is at least 50 years overdo. Lets quit giving black and brown our lunch money, band together and fight back.</p>

I have learned to distrust major efforts by the government to solve problems caused by the underclass. Nevertheless, from 1980 to 2010 the crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants in the United States has declined from 5,950.0 to 3,345.5. From 1991 to 2010  the rate of violent crime per 100,000 inhabitants has declined from 758.1 to 403.6. The murder rate during this time has declined from 9.8 to 4.8 per 100,000 inhabitants.<br/>

 <br/>
What has happened since 1980? For one thing, the prison population grew from 315,974 in 1980 to 1,428,187 in 2000.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm</a><br/>
 <br/>
Increasing the prison population, unlike moving underclass blacks around the country,  is a policy of proven effectiveness, that has broad popular support. The high cost of incarceration can be reduced by the thorough exploitation of prison labor, and an end to educational and recreational facilities. Criminals do not deserve those. They have debts to pay society.<br/>
 <br/>
In their book, &#8220;Freakonomics,&#8221; Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner argue plausibly that the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973 is primarily responsible for the decline in the rate of violent crime that began in 1992. The kind of females who are most likely to have abortions are most likely to raise boy babies who grow up to become violent street criminals. They are also most likely to raise those boys on Aid to Families with Dependent Children. <br/>
 <br/>
A potential mugger who was aborted in 1974 would have been eighteen in 1992.<br/>
 <br/>
The conservative in me favors incremental policies that have worked in the past. I lack confidence in expensive social experiments where the results are uncertain. <br/>
 <br/>
The problems of the underclass are essentially biological. Qualities that had survival value in the African jungle several centuries ago threaten more evolved humans in the twenty first century. Moreover, we are running out of jobs for people with low IQs. We need to reduce the birth rate of those people. We can do this by replacing Aid to Families with Dependent Children with free abortion on demand, and by putting congenital criminals in prison when they are younger, and keeping them there longer so that they cannot procreate. These are directions we have been moving in since 1973. They are policies of proven effectiveness. </p>

 <br/>
Black leaders and their liberal-progressive apologists would never go for it simply because, as much as you would protest,  it smacks of &#8216;racism&rsquo;.<br/>
 <br/>
Blacks and liberal whites want integration. They see it as the means to an end; racial utopia. Anything that would segregate blacks, even if it was what blacks wanted, wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed.<br/>

What we are talking about here are people with limited education, in many instances sobriety problems, and little or no work history. They also have no personal transportation in most cases and cannot reasonably be expected to make it on their own to jobs any large distance away from their own communities.</p>
<p>Becoming an adequate worker takes time and experience. Many will never be more than marginally adequate for any kind of work. One answer is to have people arrive in the morning at some local location. If they were not impaired, they would get on a bus or in a van, go to wherever they were working, work for the day, and then get taken back at the end of the day. No need to talk about the achievement gap anything else. Those who can advance will, those who can&rsquo;t will remain at the bottom. I don&rsquo;t like the idea of a sub-minimum or &#8220;workfare&#8221; wage. It is demeaning and a little merciless especially for the people who will remain in this kind of work program for the rest of their working lives. And I do hope they have one, a working life. Better this than what the bottom 20 percent has now.</p>

Let&rsquo;s do everything in our power to make the rest of America look like California as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Charles Murray talks about this phenomenon in his new book. When he was in the Ivy League in the 1960s and 70s, the elite still lived in and among the people to a certain extent. Now, students at elite colleges (and soldiers, and politicians) live in almost entirely separate, bubble-like enclaves. When the people who rule over / have decision-making power over a group with whom they have very little contact, they usually do not do what is in the best interest of the masses.</p>

They have lived with racism, and discrimination for a very long time.  It has actually got to the point where they are expected to follow laws which are definitely &#8220;raciss&#8221; in nature.  These poor people shouldn&rsquo;t ever be corrected for misbehaviour from assaulting whites, to not paying for merchandise in Korean or Muslim owned convenient stores.  Actually each major metro area should be appointed an advisor similiar to Al Sharpton, or that other fool who wants to defend the poor 18 black men that raped an 11 year old girl.  That was truly her fault, and an apology should be forthcoming from the hispanic (in this case) community for letting the girl seduce these otherwise chaste indivicuals.</p>
