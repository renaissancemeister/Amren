Paris conference attracts 700 nationalists.</div><!--/.intro-paragraph-->
				</div><!-- /.title-media-block -->
                
                	
	                	<p>On March 10, I gave a talk to an audience of more than 700 French nationalists in Paris. The meeting was called to oppose current proposals to let foreigners from non-European Union countries vote in local elections in France &mdash; and it certainly did that. But far more important, it was a ringing assertion of French identity in the face of massive Third-World immigration.</p>
<p>This was a meeting on a scale and of a quality not yet possible in the United States. The speakers were politicians, authors, academics, and corporate executives, many with national reputations, and all were united in what they want for France. <strong>Catherine Blein</strong>, president of Nationality, Identity, Citizenship (NCI) which sponsored the event, spoke for all when she declared, &ldquo;French we are, and French we must remain, in a Europe that is once again European!&rdquo; Nor did she shrink from explaining how this will happen: &ldquo;The future of foreigners is not in France but in their native lands. That is where their loyalties lie and that is where they must return.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_99031" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Audience.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-99031 " title="Audience" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Audience.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="299"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The audience applauds a speaker.</p></div>
<p>Of course, there was opposition. Early in the week, vandals broke the windows of the Espace Charenten, the hall where the meeting was to take place. When Michele Blumenthal, the Socialist mayor of the 12th ward (Paris is divided into 20 wards, each with its own mayor), which includes the Espace Charenten, heard about the meeting she said: &ldquo;This type of gathering is not just scandalous but, above all, intolerable, because it stigmatizes some of our fellow citizens . . . and contributes to a discourse that reeks of xenophobia.&rdquo; She urged the police to &ldquo;assign officers to attend the debates start to finish&rdquo; in order to &ldquo;monitor all speech that is racist, revisionist, or incites racial hatred, so that criminal charges may be brought as needed.&rdquo; There was no need for that, of course, since all the talks were streamed live over the Internet.</p>
<div id="attachment_99032" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 517px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Michele-Blumenthal.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-99032" title="Michele Blumenthal" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Michele-Blumenthal.jpg" alt="" width="507" height="392"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Michele Blumenthal, Mayor of the 12th Ward of Paris.</p></div>
<p>Police were, indeed, present in force, but stayed outside. Dressed in bullet-proof vests and shin guards, armed with clubs and automatic pistols, they kept a small band of scruffy protesters well away from the Espace Charenton.</p>
<p>So, what sort of &ldquo;incitement to hatred&rdquo; took place at the conference?</p>
<p><strong>Jean-Yves Le Gallou </strong>(<a href="/ar/1998/11/index.html#article3">interviewed</a> in AR, Nov. 1998)<strong>, </strong>one of the founders of the prestigious intellectual circle knows as the Club de l&rsquo;Horloge, listed a number of elements that define French nationality, of which this was the first:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be French is to be part of a lineage that stretches back into the mists of time, whose character &mdash; white and European &mdash; remained essentially unchanged until the beginning of the 1970s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was one of several speakers who quoted General de Gaulle:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is well that there be yellow Frenchmen, black Frenchmen, and brown Frenchmen, for this shows that France is open to all races and has a universal vocation &mdash; but only on condition that they remain a small minority. Otherwise France will cease to be France. We are, after all and above all, a European people of the white race with a culture that is Grecian and Latin and a religion that is Christianity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Le Gallou also quoted Ernest Renan (1823 &mdash; 1892) on national identity: &ldquo;We note that in order to create such a [national] spirit the following are [necessary but] not sufficient: race, language, common interests, a religious affinity, a territory, military preparedness. What else is necessary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renan went on to answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>To have shared past glories, to have a common will in the present, to have done wonderful things in the past and yearn to do yet more, these are the essential conditions to be a people. We love in proportion to the sacrifices we accept, the ills we have suffered. . . . The Spartan hymn &ldquo;we are what you were and will become what you are&rdquo; is, in its simplicity, the anthem of every fatherland.</p></blockquote>

<p>Popular radio personality <strong>Jean-Paul Bourre </strong>was unable to attend the conference itself, but in remarks prepared and distributed beforehand, he warned of the threat of invasion:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is no longer an obvious enemy, identifiable by its uniform and its flags, that is massing its divisions on the frontiers of Europe. The era of straight-forward war, when men chose between honor and treason is now part of a romantic past. Today we face a new form of conquest, conquest by deceit and cynical exploitation of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; sentimentalism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Bourre quoted current French president Nicolas Sarkozy in a speech of Dec. 17, 2008: &ldquo;We must face the 21st-century challenge of miscegenation. It is not a choice but an obligation, an imperative.&rdquo; Mr. Bourre called this an outrage, adding that &ldquo;in another era, such a declaration would have sent citizens by the tens of thousands into the streets, and the ministries and other seats of power would have been reduced to ruin and ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Marc Rousset</strong> holds an MBA from Columbia and has had a 20-year career as an executive for major French companies, such as Aventis and Carrefour, with postings in Asia and Brazil. He warned that there is no guarantee that a people will survive:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the second millennium before Christ, what is now Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan was not ruled by Asiatics but by an Aryan people, the Scythes. They spoke an Indo-European language and were described by Herodotus as &ldquo;having blond and light-colored hair.&rdquo; No doubt they succumbed to what the Slavs call &ldquo;the white plague&rdquo; of low birth rates and its corollary: the submersion by other ethnicities of greater fecundity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, he said, the crisis of immigration &ldquo;threatens to produce a catastrophe as serious as the fall of Byzantium and the capture by the Turks of Constantinople in 1453.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Guillaume de Thieulloy</strong>, editor of a magazine called <em>Les 4 Verités</em> (<em>The 4 Truths</em>), spoke movingly of what a Frenchman feels for France:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are not attached to France because it is the land of &ldquo;human rights.&rdquo; It is not even because it is one of the most beautiful countries in the world with a cultural heritage virtually without peer. It is for a reason far simpler and far more profound: It is because France is where we were born. It is because France nourished and reared us. Patriotism derives, as it should, from the Fifth Commandment that requires that we honor our fathers and mothers. France, like our parents, we accept and love, entirely aside from its qualities, for the sole fact that it is our fatherland.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_99040" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 586px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Guillaume-de-Thieulloy.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-99040 " title="Guillaume de Thieulloy" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Guillaume-de-Thieulloy.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="572"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Guillaume de Thieulloy</p></div>
<p><strong>Yves-Marie Laulan</strong>, who served in government under President Charles de Gaulle and in high positions in the NATO command, cited evidence for systematic lying by the French authorities about the consequences of immigration:</p>
<blockquote><p>The secret intent of the government is clearly to hide the current catastrophic reality regarding the demographic situation in France. The goal of these lies is to present the public with a <em>fait accompli</em> that will be justified with the usual refrain, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late; we must resign ourselves to the inevitable.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the most impassioned talks was by <strong>Pierre Cassen</strong>, a militant trade unionist and former member of Revolutionary Communist League, who proved that nationalism is not the province only of the Right. He noted that immigration hurts workers because it lowers salaries, and that Islam is a threat to French identity. He is the founder of a group called Riposte Laïque<em> </em>(Lay Riposte), which rejects Islam root and branch. He pointed out that Marxism calls for international solidarity of labor, &ldquo;but in no case is it an apology for any religion or immigration of any kind.&rdquo; He called for an end to all immigration, legal or illegal because at stake &ldquo;is nothing more nor less than the survival of the most beautiful country on earth: France.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_99034" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 615px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Pierre-Cassen.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-99034 " title="Pierre Cassen" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Pierre-Cassen.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="466"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pierre Cassen proves that nationalism is not a monopoly of the right.</p></div>
<p><strong>Filip Dewinter</strong> is a leader of the Vlaams Belang and spoke at the most recent American Renaissance <a href="/ar/2011/03/index.html">conference</a>  (his latest book is reviewed <a href="../../../features/2012/02/the-islamic-threat.html">here</a>). He was one of the best received speakers at NCI, hammering home the need to defend the West:</p>
<blockquote><p>If there is a challenge that Europe faces today it is none other than the combat to save our European identity. We Europeans must dare to rise up in the name of our identity. . . . As a European people, our identity can only be Occidental.</p>
<p>Just as AIDS destroys the human body&rsquo;s resistance against disease, multiculturalism attacks our resistance against assaults on our identity, our civilization, our culture, and our existence as a people. Multiculturalism has brought us Islam: a cuckoo&rsquo;s egg laid in the nest of Europe. We Europeans are warming this cuckoo&rsquo;s egg, blind to the fact that we could be cast out of our own nest.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_99035" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 586px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Dewinter.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-99035 " title="Dewinter" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Dewinter.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="466"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Filip Dewinter</p></div>
<p>The final speaker was <strong>Fabrice Robert</strong>, founder of the group Bloc Identitaire, which was the main organizing force behind the meeting. Mr. Robert is just 40 years old, a gifted speaker, a father of three children, and was a favorite of the crowd. Calling for &ldquo;a <em>reconquista</em> of the mind,&rdquo; he argued that &ldquo;territorial imperative requires that one land belong to one people,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;peoples are different, ethnicities are different, and civilizations are by their very nature psychic boundaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like many others, he spoke of the love of land and nation: &ldquo;We love Europe because we were born here. Our parents and our entire lineage are rooted in this promontory that juts out into the Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His conclusion brought the audience to its feet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Against this new age of slavery that has laid waste to the world for 30 years, against this crime against humanity that is the denial of identity, against this mentality that would transform humanity into a uniform mush, we call for a return to reason, a return to who we are.</p></blockquote>
<p>I spoke near the end of the program &mdash; in French &mdash; and concluded a speech about the American cult of diversity with these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>I now speak to you from the bottom of my heart: Do not make the terrible mistakes we have made in America. Avoid at all costs the cult of diversity.</p>
<p>I am American to the bone, but I have lived in France and believe I understand, at least a little, the spirit and genius of France. And part of the genius of France is its regions &mdash; an authentic diversity that deserves to be cherished.</p>
<p>The title of this meeting is &ldquo;France in Danger.&rdquo; France <strong>is</strong> in danger, for if France becomes diverse it will no longer be France. It is absolutely essential that France remain French &mdash; for its own sake and that of the whole world.</p>
<p>You are all gathered in this room because of the deep love you have for your country. The struggle for a France that is authentic, for regions that are authentic, for an authentic Europe is the fundamental struggle of our time.</p>
<p>Because it is not only France that is in danger. When you fight for France and for Europe you are fighting for all the children of Europe who live overseas. You are fighting for me. You are fighting for our comrades in Canada, in Australia, and in South Africa. We are all brothers in arms.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of people like you in this room France <strong>will</strong> be saved. Long live France! Long live France as it has always been!</p></blockquote>

<p>This brought most of the crowd roaring to its feet. Afterwards I was warmly congratulated by men and women who said they never thought they would hear an American say <em>Vive la France</em>. Some said they had never before applauded an American.</p>
<p>These are people who see the world exactly as we do, who know what is at stake, and are prepared to fight for the nation and culture they love.</p>
<p>NCI can be justly proud of a wonderfully successful conference.</p>

It&rsquo;s much the same here in the U.S., where anybody, for a few bucks to a governmental bureaucrat, can buy my family name. This is a far worse case of &#8216;identity theft&rsquo; than what gets talked about in the news. It is the height of disrespect to an ethnic group to steal their family heritage. Only a utopian alcoholic degenerate like Karl &#8216;Marx&rsquo; could conceive that it would be rational and fitting that an arctic Inuit hunter, a Tongan native, or an Amazonian spearman could and should have the last name &#8216;Blumenthal&rsquo;. A lie is always a lie. They would have been more honest if they had stuck with their more utilitarian method of &#8216;identifying&rsquo; us. Hello, my name is THX-1138.

What a moment it must have been, when you finished with, &#8220;Vive la France!&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t suppose the New York Times will take notice of this event, but a followup on European media reaction (beyond the links provided in the article) would be interesting.  </p>
<p>Americans like me are sometimes puzzled by the relationships, or lack of relationships, between  the various European nationalist &amp; identitarian groups, and especially the lack of coordination or any attempts at alliances between them, especially in France. I know there is a move to form an identitarian bloc between nationalist parties in the European Parliament, but other than that, little has been done for decades.</p>
<p>In particular, I think GRECE missed an opportunity to become a kind of Fabian Society to the Front National years ago. Such a combination could have developed considerable synergy and produced positive effects over time in both popular culture and politics at all levels and won more support for racialist and traditionalist ideas from the French people in general and their elites in particular.</p>
<p>Or so I would like to think.</p>
<p>Guillame Faye mentions the difficulties between the FN and GRECE in ARCHEOFUTURISM, but perhaps he will elaborate a bit when he talks to us at the AR conference on Saturday.</p>
<p>Speaking of which&hellip;there is a petition, from change.org and the usual suspects, demanding that the state of Tennessee deny its facilities to the conference. Last time I checked it had about 150 signatures. (It&rsquo;s posted several places, i/c the Facebook page for Tenn. state parks.) Not exactly a firestorm of protest, but let us hope Tennessee does its duty, including physical security on-site this week before the conference begins. (Once it does, we can take care of ourselves!)   </p>

&#8221;<br/>
The Joy of Curmudgeonry&rsquo;s Deogolwulf has a simply amazing post on the agenda of the United States government to promote diversity, that is the promotion of minority groups at the expense of the majority, along with extensive propagandizing of the latter, in&hellip; France. Deogolwulf&rsquo;s source is Wikileaks, and the cited words are all from the American Embassy in Paris, the &#8220;Minority Engagement Strategy&#8221;. Here&rsquo;s a sample, see the link for the rest:&ldquo;[W]e will continue and intensify our work with French museums and educators to reform the history curriculum taught in French schools, so that it takes into account the role and perspectives of minorities in French history.&rdquo; [2]</p>
<p>We will create or support training and exchange programs that teach the enduring value of broad inclusion to schools, civil society groups, bloggers, political advisors, and local politicians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, a Minority Working Group will integrate the discourse, actions, and analysis of relevant sections and agencies in the Embassy. This group, working in tandem with the Youth Outreach Initiative, will identify and target influential leaders and groups among our primary audiences. It will also evaluate our impact over the course of the year, by examining both tangible and intangible indicators of success. Tangible changes include a measurable increase in the number of minorities leading and participating in public and private organizations, including elite educational institutions; growth in the number of constructive efforts by minority leaders to organize political support both within and beyond their own minority communities; new, proactive policies to enhance social inclusion adopted by non-minority political leaders; expansion of inter-communal and inter-faith exchanges at the local level; decrease in popular support for xenophobic political parties and platforms.State Department apparatchiks will now not only teach the French about the proper understanding of their own history, but also look like they&rsquo;re actively promoting the Islamisation and Africanisation of France. That&rsquo;s pretty close to what the government and its media enablers already promote here, so why not let France have the best America has to offer?&#8221;</p>

&#8220;A &#8221;Festival of the Cultures of Islam&#8221; is now (September 7-17) in full swing in Paris. You&rsquo;re paying for it. Why?</p>
<p>This bit of multiculti showbiz was ginned up by the City of Paris and the U.S. Embassy &mdash; which has gone so far as to lend the Stars And Stripes (see right) to the islamopropaganda &mdash; along with (what a surprise) Harvard University.<br/>
The Institut&rsquo;s website  says the Festival has been &#8220;organized through a partnership (réalisé en partenariat )between the City of Paris, the United States Embassy in France and Harvard University.&#8221; Such réalisations always cost you money.<br/>
Since Barack Hussein Obama sent former Muppets CEO Charles Rivkin to be the U.S. Ambassador to France (what did his bijou post cost him, I wonder?), Rivkin has pursued a &#8220;Minority Engagement Strategy &#8221; designed  to endear himself to, while increasing the political power of, those residents of France who are not, well, French.  [In Smart-Power Shift, U.S. Now Actively Cultivating Muslim Minorities In The EU, By Garret Martin,European Affairs, April 2011]&#8221;<br/>

Seems like our leaders are against their own people and their own nations. </p>
<p>This imposed multiculturalism destroys the concept that one nation is comprised of one people. Perhaps WW II made the world&rsquo;s &#8220;ruling elite&#8221; (academic, financial, industrial, media, and political), decide that when one nation is comprised of one people they are more likely to be unified in a war of aggression against other nations. Thus, dividing a nation&rsquo;s people makes them less likely to be unified against another people in another nation. </p>
<p>But there are other effects: the various peoples in that nation are now more likely to &#8220;war&#8221; against each other within that nation (i.e., racial/ethnic gangs or civil war). This reduction in peace/increase in disharmony and violence will reduce the productivity and standard of living in that nation, as well as make it more vulnerable to being conquered by a people who are united. Violence will justify the reduction of liberty and increase in police powers for internal &#8220;peace keeping&#8221; to maintain law and order. </p>
<p>Eventually the state will increase its power even more, to the point of becoming a police state, since the divided populace will be unlikely to unite against the ever encroaching state. We will be oppressed by our &#8220;diverse&#8221; neighbors and oppressed by the overarching state. Our power hungry &#8220;leaders&#8221; will have &#8220;divided and conquered&#8221; us and become our rulers!</p>

<p>Almost get it.  Their long time Achilles Heel is race, and their fundamental belief in racial equality.  Though I should say, most Birchers at the dues paying level are probably far more AR and far less MLK on race, and there was a very good almost AR-quality article about the Kansadishu City necklacing incident in their magazine recently.  But among JBS leadership is the constant strain of race denial, and the attempt to genuflect racial differences on the machinations of a hostile elite.  Or they sometimes say worrying about black crime when we have Rockefeller treachery aplenty is like worrying about draining the swamp when we&rsquo;re up to our necks in gators.  Fortunately, I have enough frontal lobe space to worry about both black crime AND Rockefellers, (one should note, most elected Rockefellers were/are big into &#8220;civil rights.&#8221;)</p>

I say it astounded me because of the past historical animosity bwtween those two nations. Why would the French elect as their president, a man who was born in Germany?</p>
<p>While on the subject of politics, who here knew that George Romney, the father of Mitt, was actually born in MEXICO - and NOT the United States, as required by the U.S. Constitution? That&rsquo;s right, he was born in Mexico, but for some reason this was NEVER brought up, during his (short-lived) presidential campaign in 1968.</p>
<p>Jeffaral, you are correct, paisan. Michele Blumenthal is a Jewess, through and through. As we know, Jews are the most vociferous when it comes to wanting multiculturalism in every nation on planet Earth, whether it&rsquo;s the U.S., Russia, Turkey, China, South Sudan, or Brazil.</p>
<p>Except when it comes to Israel, of course. They don&rsquo;t want THEIR ox to be gored.</p>
<p>Besides, Blumenthal doesn&rsquo;t look Bulgarian or Icelander; but instead, looks like a fat Carol Channing, to me.</p>
