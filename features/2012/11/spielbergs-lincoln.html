&ldquo;History&rdquo; in the service of ideology.</div> 
</div> 


<p>Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s latest &ldquo;historical&rdquo; sermon begins with The Bearded One smiling beatifically at two black Union soldiers, who recount their exploits at a battle that is a figment of Mr. Spielberg&rsquo;s imagination. The bolder, more intelligent of the two hectors the President on the pay inequalities between black and white soldiers. The scene is interspersed with footage from the mythical battle, in which black Union troops overcome white Confederates in brutal hand-to-hand combat. A white face is stamped, drowning, into the mud by a booted black man.</p>
<p>This may be all you need to know about the movie.</p>
<p>Two white, hick Union soldiers run up breathlessly and ineptly try to recite Lincoln&rsquo;s Gettysburg address for the President. They forget how it ends, and the recital is finished by the intelligent, complaining black private as he saunters off into the night. Stupid whites and smart blacks. We get it. We see that in every TV commercial during basketball timeouts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/KJVuqYkI2jQ" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>It is all downhill from there, as Daniel Day-Lewis&rsquo;s simpering, unbelievable Lincoln is surrounded by saintly, misty-eyed, cardboard-cutout blacks, as he battles courageously against the reactionary elements in Congress who would <em>never</em> give votes to &ldquo;the Negro.&rdquo; In fact, blacks had been voting in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey since the Articles of Confederation, and the 15th Amendment, which gave blacks the right to vote, was passed just a few years later, in 1869.</p>
<p>Someone remarks that the Confederates &ldquo;want to take slavery even into South America.&rdquo; The Spanish brought black slaves to the New World more than 100 years before the first slaves appeared in the British colonies, and slavery wasn&rsquo;t abolished in Cuba until 1886 and Brazil in 1888. But who cares about the real story? Apart from a few enlightened men such as Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens, all whites were rabid racists all too willing to sell out blacks for peace with the South, even when it was in its death throes. Mr. Spielberg knows that such distortions will slip past uncritical audiences.</p>
<p>The subtext, of course, is that the Union could not have defeated the Confederacy without the valiant efforts of black soldiers. Since the Union was full of vicious racists, they would have left blacks as they were had Lincoln not listened to urgings of his sanctified black housemaid and other ebony worthies.</p>
<div id="attachment_102131" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 586px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/BlackUnionSoldiers.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-102131 " title="BlackUnionSoldiers" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/BlackUnionSoldiers.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="432"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Black Union soldiers.</p></div>
<p>In the modern Hollywood narrative, all American history revolves around the Sacred Black Experience. <em>Lincoln</em> confirms this, bending historical truth to paint the most ruthless, bloody-minded, strong-willed American leader in history as some kind of smug, pre-post-modern storyteller croaking gamely through the difficulties like a paleface Obama <em>sans</em> teleprompter. The few Southerners are snarling, greasy bigots, recoiling before the erect, scowling black Union guards as they slink by during a meeting that led to the Hampton Roads peace conference of February 1865.</p>
<p>No noble Lee, courageous Stonewall or knightly Forrest to see here; but why should we expect that? I was surprised not to see the Southern delegation accompanied by blond, Afrikaans-speaking advisors from South Africa, along with a few monocled British Empire villains. Another surprise was that General Grant was not played by Morgan Freeman or that Magic Negro extraordinaire, Samuel L. Jackson.</p>
<p>The film has throughout a sense of hushed awe, as if kowtowing to its own self-evident righteousness. There is no balance, no complexity, no sense of inner struggle or desperation. No opposing arguments. Its simplistic outlook more closely resembles the popcorn-psychology <em>Avengers</em> or <em>Justice League</em> rather than the serious historical movie that it clearly wishes to be acclaimed.</p>
<p>Mr. Day-Lewis radiates pompous self-absorption, and his interpretation jars against my gut-feeling of Lincoln, the rawboned, shrewd backwoods attorney-Lincoln, the Illinois rogue so memorably sketched in <em>Flash for Freedom!</em> by George MacDonald Fraser. Yes, Lincoln is involved in political skulduggery and intrigue, as the three fixers/bribers blunder and cajole their way through improbable situations in an effort to sway the House for the 13th Amendment, but it comes off as silly capering.</p>
<div id="attachment_102133" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lincoln.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-102133" title="Film-Lincoln" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lincoln.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="389"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A still from Spielberg&rsquo;s <em>Lincoln</em>.</p></div>
<p>There is not the slightest hint, of course, that Lincoln wanted to free the slaves and then send them out of the country. No dramatic scenes from August 14, 1862, when Lincoln invited five black preachers to the White House and asked them to persuade other blacks to resettle in Central America. No earnest conversations between Lincoln and Rev. James Mitchell, whom he had put in charge of exporting blacks. All this would make eye-opening cinema, but why let the truth spoil an image of Lincoln as a pioneer egalitarian?</p>
<p>To Mr. Spielberg&rsquo;s credit, the cinematography is superb, as is the period detail. Articulate speeches are also a welcome respite from the usual lowbrow movie soundbites. Yet the work is let down by the smarmy lead performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as well as the historical inaccuracies and stereotypes, which have obviously been inserted to foist a politically-correct message onto the audience. And when will we get a realistic, multifaceted black character in a movie, instead of the constant stream of sinless, chocolate-hued demigods? When will the Magic Negro finally be retired? No time soon, judging by this travesty.</p>
<p>An interesting movie about black battlefield valor might be made about the troops who served in General George Crook&rsquo;s Apache campaigns during the 1870s and 1880s. But would we see a black boot trampling an Apache face?</p>
<p>It is hardly astonishing that Hollywood has turned out yet another movie with an anti-white agenda this time from the director of the execrable <em>Munich</em>, which also played fast and loose with history in its sordid depiction of Israel&rsquo;s use of a team of bungling amateurs to carry out a series of cold-blooded assassinations. Mr. Spielberg has, however, accomplished the unthinkable with this one. He has actually succeeded in making the Civil War look schmaltzy and one dimensional. The Sacred Black Experience is the only history that matters, and the only thing that ever prevented these noble Negroes from attaining their uplifting potential was foaming old white guys with mutton-chops.</p>
<p>As my wife and I left the cinema for the cold night, a pair of young black men swaggered by, baggy pants sagging past their buttocks, communicating in barely decipherable ebonic grunts.</p>
<p>We looked at each other with wry smiles and sighed.</p>

In addition, why would any white person want to celebrate the life of the biggest mass murderer of the 19th century? Even in grammar school I found the whole idea of the war between the states something odd to celebrate. And it wasn&rsquo;t a civil war in any sense of the word. First off the CSA did not want to take over the US, merely secede. Secondly what the North did to southern soldiers, southern civilians and the south in general is nothing less than war crimes certainly on a par with anything Stalin, Hitler, Mao or Pol Pot did. The main difference was they had technology Lincoln didn&rsquo;t. Lincoln and his gang were criminals, no more, no less.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not quite true. Perhaps as many as 20-30 million Chinese were killed in the Tai-Ping rebellion of the 1850s-1860s, altogether by both the Tai-Ping rebels and the Imperial government. Lincoln, with a mere 600,000 war dead to his credit, was a comparative piker.</p>

<p>Ironically, Ted is the archetypal wing nut lunatic fringe right wing white conservative in this country. People like him do no favors for the GOP nor the conservative movement at large. The white conservative movement will die out &amp; become extinct NOT due to the liberals or minorities, BUT because of conservatives themselves.</p>

<p>I would welcome a genuine conservative movement in the tradition of Edmund Burke. Unfortunately, what passes for conservatism in the United States is often little more than hatred for taxes and gun control laws.</p>
<p>In the 1960s liberals went out on a limb to help blacks with civil rights legislation. Blacks cut off the limb with five years of black ghetto rioting, and more enduring increases in black social pathology. Liberals have been trying to recover ever since.</p>
<p>One of my favorite political commentators is Thomas Edsall. Here is his explanation of how American liberalism ran off the rail during the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<p>Glenn Beck - Arch Fruitcake of the right wing fringe. This man is clearly the most insane unprofessional media personality ever to disgrace the TV screen. He is unqualified ( not even a graduate but just a high school diploma) and despite his lack of education and intelligence, he keeps inciting hatred and suspicion against blacks, Jews, Asians and hispanics. I bet his followers have to have an IQ of less than 67 to actually digest his nonsense! So bad was his record, that even conservative Fox had to fire this fat stupid clown!</p>

<p>Looks like you are afraid of facts and logic my deluded friend. I have presented numerous links and evidence to support my views and yet for some odd reason, you show this irrational animus towards me. People like you remind me of those low IQ white conservative christian creationists who simply and rather stubbornly I must say, refute my views on the validity of evolution by ruminating their &#8220;faith&#8221; and &#8220;belief&#8221; in some myth from a Bronze age book, written in a desert in a remote corner of the middle east some 4500 odd years ago. Even when supplied with ample facts and evidence/ links, these arrogant conservative pro-gun/ pro-life white christians depict their retarded bigotry and prejudice based NOT on facts but on raw emotions and blind &#8220;faith&#8221;! Congrats for depicting who you really are? </p>
<p>Oh and please spare me the boring &#8220;troll&#8221; rhetoric. That lame excuse has gone long enough to become stale. If you want to hide behind blind faith and emotions based on irrational bigotry and colossal stupidity, at least have the decency to use a new line of excuses to banter on about the &#8220;evils&#8221; of having people like me&hellip;.don&rsquo;t keep barking the same &#8220;he is a troll&#8221; BS.

I do not support the annihilation of the present Israeli population now established, and I advocate internationally protected access to the holy places of Christians, Jews and Muslims however mythical their claims. And I can see why they do not want Palestinians returning to undermine the national character of Israel, just as other countries for the same reason do not want Muslim immigrants arriving as original settlers in theirs.<br/>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-155152" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;Never having watched Beck, I cannot say whether he ever actually attacked other races, but I found nothing in your samples in which he attacked other races, yet you called him a &#8220;racist&#8221;. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>So, you claim not to have seen Beck, but you somehow managed to ascertain that he is not a racist. And the samples I provided clearly show the low IQ irrational fat bigot clown that he really is. If you were unable to figure that out from the links I provided than I can confidently state that either you are so retarded cursed with an IQ &lt;70 or perhaps you are lying!</p>
<p>&quot;You disparaged him for not having a college degree. Why? Most Americans don't have college degrees. That does not make them stupid, does it?&quot;</p>
<p>To have a job as a journalist or TV reporter - it IS strongly recommended and more so even required in most nations including here to have either a bachelor or master degree in journalism, communications, arts or in some cases even a higher professional degree in medicine ( Dr. Sanjay Gupta, MD, Chief Medical Officer, CNN or law (Megyn Kelly, JD, &quot;Kelly's Court&quot; Fox News). After all, had an under qualified black or hispanic been a TV reporter without a standard set of educational qualifications, I'm sure all hell would have broken loose and you would have been one of the first to scream &quot;bloody murder!&quot; Double Standards?</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not, for any job today and more so, a job that involves some sort of intellectual caliber apart from first professional degrees of course (i.e. Medicine, Law, Engineering, Physical Therapy, Pharmacy, Dentistry, Accountant, Economics,etc) you NEED to have adequate educational credentials. If most white Americans don't go to college, well that is their problem not mine. Had Jared Taylor not gone to a fancy Ivy League University like Yale, no one on would have taken him seriously, heck he would have been ignored just like you ignore a mad man rambling in the middle of a street, selling pencils in a paper cup! </p>
<p>&quot;Maybe the reason &quot;Faux News&quot; fired Beck is because Beck wandered off of the reservation of what is &quot;acceptable&quot; in our tightly controlled news industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Hah, so now even you seem to imply on admission that Beck stated something so vitriolic and obviously racist that Fox had to kick his fat dumb derriere out!</p>
<p>&quot;What about the rest of the so-called &quot;conservatives&quot; you attacked? Laura Ingraham, for example. I have seen her on TV many times, but have never heard her say anything that I would describe as &quot;racist&quot;. Can you give an example of a &quot;racist&quot; comment by her?&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lauraingrahamsucks.com/category/laura-the-racist/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lauraingrahamsucks.com/category/laura-the-racist/</a></p>
<p>Also, funny how someone like Ingraham and Ann Coulter who keep harping with their idiotic annoying nasal tones about how pro-family, pro-life and pro-hetro-sexual marriage they are somehow managed to stay single and never got into the sacred sacrament of matrimony themselves, neither do any of themselves have their own biological children. Instead, these conservative loony women have had numerous affairs (including with liberal white and non white men like Dinesh D'Souza) sans marriage! Classic hypocrisy of the deluded conservative mind!</p>
<p>&quot;You say that you admire the &quot;conservatism&quot; of Barry Goldwater? Are you a Barry Goldwater conservative? Or are you a troll here to defend the other troll, John Engelman?&quot;</p>
<p>I agree with Goldwater's conservative ideology NOT the nonsense that passes off as conservatism today. Btw, I don't consider myself a liberal. I'm a rationalist, I see the world in shades of grey - NOT black or white! Human nature is too complex and so is our universe with all it's 11 dimensions of reality! If John Engleman is a troll, I'd be honored to be in the same league. I shall now wear my &quot;troll&quot; tag as a badge of honor!

In fact even this movie - &#8220;Lincoln&#8221; 2012 is directed &amp; produced by a liberal Jew ( Steven Spielberg) starring a famous British Jew ( Daniel Day Lewis), and needless to say, the plot of this brilliant movie is in some ways sympathetic to the plight of blacks.</p>

I&rsquo;m not a bigot and I can see the beauty &amp; ugliness in every race or ethnic group. For example, I&rsquo;ve served in the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) and I&rsquo;ve personally had to serve in places hostile to us in the Palestine Territories and Lebanon, however, just because we&rsquo;re on the opposite sides of the spectrum that did not mean, I could never appreciate certain positive aspects of the Arabs (eg: Arab hospitality, food, sense of humor, love for horse racing and music etc).</p>
<p>To think of demonizing an entire race is not only ridiculous but plain evil! Eg: The 3rd reich in the Weimar republic of Germany demonizing the entire Jewish race. Humans are complex and no particular human group irrespective of race and gender can be treated as a monolith. Not because this is the politically correct thing to do, but more so, because it is the right thing to do!</p>

<p>I usually more than agree with you Istvan, but Serbia never was bombed into oblivion. Milosevic was simply right in the midst of killing and cleansing Kosovo of its indigenous Albanian <b> civilians</b> which comprised 90% of its population, no less. NATO (including the Brits and the French) simply put a stop to it to avoid what the Serbs did in Bosnia (ie: Sarajevo siege, Srebenica massacre), and the bombing ended as soon as Milosevic stopped.</p>
<p>The Serbs like to claim that &#8220;Kosovo is Serbia&#8221; but the indigenous Albanians were already the majority there long before the Serbs lost it to the Turks in 1389 (Battle of Kosovo) and only got it back in 1912 (Second Balkan War).</p>
<p>The 78 days NATO bombing was a slap in the wrist compared to what the Serbs inflicted for years to their Balkan neighbors (Slovenes, Croats, Bosniaks and Kosovars) in the name of &#8220;Greater Serbia&#8221;, and White nationalists really ought to know better to use it as an argument for defending one&rsquo;s &#8220;national integrity&#8221;:</p>
<p>Is Kosovo Serbia ?:</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-153354" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Unfortunately, many young whites will take this movie as historic fact. This is a particular peeve of mine   &mdash;   the continual aggrandizement of the black male. He is portrayed by a certain segment of our society as superb athlete, highly intelligent, and the ideal mate for the white female. Think I am exaggerating in any way? See <a href="http://www.antiwhitemedia.com/?m=0" rel="nofollow"> here&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Scroll down the page and watch the clips which document how the white man is portrayed as a bumbling idiot compared to the intelligent, masculine, handsome, sexually desirable black man. Especially by white women who actually shun the white man in favor of the black man in these clips. They have gone from subtle suggestion a few years ago to in-your-face blatant today.</p>
<p>The messages being sent by advertisers and the media is clear. White boys are being taught through psychological manipulation that the black man is his superior. White girls are being taught that the white man is weak, almost effeminate, compared to the manly and wise black man. It is the black man that she should be involved with. It is he that she should have desires for.</p>
<p>The black man as he actually is with no white influence upon him is never shown. To see the black man as he exists today without any white influence upon him see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?nomobile=1&amp;v=6svzUhLUD18" rel="nofollow">here&hellip;</a></p>
<p>That is actual modern footage of the black man as he would also exist here in the US if he were isolated from white culture. This is the real black man being pawned off as our superior. This is what the media is suggesting your daughter mate with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve a gut full of this evilry put upon us by the media!</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s funny everyone harps on about white feminazis&hellip; lol,. what happened to men?</p>
<p>I am not saying Black men are a great dating option or are more &#8220;real men&#8221;, as we all know Black men generally fail to be &#8220;real men&#8221; in many other ways and in actuality, in black culture, it is the black female who is really in charge.

<p>Also, I see a lot of people decrying White men as weak and effeminate, but compared to what? Black thugs who get in a fistfight every other day and have no qualms about attacking innocent strangers? <i>They&rsquo;re</i> the abomination, not us. I agree that White people need to learn to defend themselves, but isn&rsquo;t the reason for having civilization at all that people don&rsquo;t have to live by the law of the jungle? I say make Whites aware of the violence perpetrated against them and steer people into learning to defend themselves, but understand that the rules have changed in a relatively short amount of time and don&rsquo;t condemn our own people too harshly. Questioning White men&rsquo;s masculinity for being peaceful and culturally sophisticated is like trashing a Rolex for not being an effective hammer.</p>

<p>The young men fall into three categories: hipsters, metros and white ethnic meatheads, some of whom go into wiggerdom with their thuggishness.<br/>
The hipsters and metros are so USELESS. They do reclaim areas for whites that had been taken over by blacks/latinos (gentrification, as it&rsquo;s called), and they do cause yummy restaurants to flourish, but they are so weak and effeminate. The &#8216;ironic&rsquo; clothing they wear (dumpster diving from the 1970s) is so important to them.<br/>
They&rsquo;re always worried about the next &#8216;underground&rsquo; band, and most seem like they are just big kids living some weird psychadelic fantasy. They shack up with 3-4 roommates to pay the bills on their coffee shop salaries and try their best to outdo the next grungy guy in conformity to the hipster ethos. Forget about the &#8216;Friends&rsquo; lifestyle, they take &#8216;The Big Bang Theory&rsquo; or &#8216;Modern Family&rsquo; as cultural gold.</p>
<p>The metros are just so sad too. No wonder so many white chicks are going black/latino around here. At least they still exude manly aggression, even if it is ultimately dangerous. The metros are like hipsters with more money/class, but how can you rely on a man who gets pedicures every week and espouses his love for all things gay while professing to be straight? If you ever saw the Hunger Games, the flambouyant people of the &#8220;Capital&#8221; are what modern white 20-somethings aspire to in urban areas like mine. Life is just a big fashion show and endless parade of pleasures. The hipsters pay lip service to &#8216;social justice&rsquo; causes and love slumming it as a lifestyle to prove their liberal cred, but metros like that &#8216;fabulous&rsquo; lifestyle best depicted in their affinity for higher end dance clubs and art shows..</p>
<p>The ethnic whites are not our salvation folks. Their young men mostly are thuggish, not at all civilized like most regular middle class Americans we&rsquo;ve always known growing up. Their young men are into rap/hip hop, wear the ghetto themed sports clothes, shave their heads, are rowdy and some go over into straight wiggerdom. They are also very anti-intellectual at every level and combine elements of their parents or grandparents ethnic cultures with gangsta rap bravado.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to see any white people where I&rsquo;m at right now and feel any cultural affinity with them as an American. Ours is a people who are passing away. Even in the last remaining years of the Roman Empire, some people saw where things were going and lamented the fall of a great civilization. The tragedy now is that there will be no resevoir of latent talent to make a new civilization centuries from now. 50 years from now when competing black/latino and asians enclaves put the final nail in the coffin, will any of their descendants build a first world civilization again?</p>

Over the years I&rsquo;ve met people from upstate NY towns or towns in Pennsylvania who have had to move to the NYC area because there are no more jobs in the areas they grew up in. They often strike me as being from another American culture, a more traditional one from the past. Then they move to New York and it&rsquo;s like another country. Less egalitarian.Traditional gender roles and behavior a thing of the past. More elitist (I use the term &#8220;Brazilified&#8221;) with a top class of wealthy, cosmopolitan whites living affluent, sophisticated (and, yes, sometimes metrosexual) lifestyles and a vast non-white working-class (with more traditional gender roles) living in the more affordable (but less hospitable to whites) parts of town. These traditional white Americans from small towns understandably feel completely alienated. They often find an affordable place to live in the white lower-middle or working-class areas outside of Manhattan. That&rsquo;s where they have the (dis)pleasure of meeting the &#8220;white ethnic meatheads.&#8221;<br/>
&#8220;The ethnic whites are not our salvation folks&hellip;They are also very anti-intellectual at every level and combine elements of their parents or grandparents ethnic cultures with gangsta rap bravado.&#8221; Sounds like you have been getting to know some of the locals! Welcome to New York! All kidding aside, I totally agree with you. These said &#8220;ethnic whites&#8221; you speak of are on the most degraded end of the Euro-American spectrum. It is partly an issue of intelligence and social class. The smarter ones moved up and out, The less promising stayed in their little neighborhoods and always had an inclination for brutality and organized crime. They are intensely anti-intellectual. I would know. I grew up around a lot of them in the New York suburbs. Such meatheads despised and were hostile to the larger Anglo-Saxon American people and culture. Wilmot Robertson in his book &#8220;The Dispossessed Majority&#8221; considered certain white ethnic groups to be less likely to assimilate into the larger Euro-American culture. He was right.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming this is just Italian-bashing backed up by Nordicism, right? I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re gonna tell me that them dagos is all mulattoes anyway.<br/>
I&rsquo;m not seeing much White ethnicism among any European groups, be they Italian or &#8220;Anglo-Saxon.&#8221; No, the ethnic whites sure aren&rsquo;t our salvation, but neither are the WASPs. Southerners and possibly Mormons are about it, and neither group is ethnically healthy.<br/>
There are the Amish, however.</p>

Obviously there are some physical differences between men and women, this isn&rsquo;t a negative thing it&rsquo;s just how it is. Obviously women in the past weren&rsquo;t out killing mastadons and sabretooth tigers, they were at home taking care of their children. Is this sexist and discriminatory? Absolutely not.

<p>I distinguish between white men and jewish men, as I recognize white as an ethnicity made up in the US of northwestern europeans primarily. People who say they come from the Middle East really don&rsquo;t fit into even the totally european category and it does seem notable to me that a jewish-made film so seriously distorts &#8216;race&rsquo; issues in this film.</p>

<p>Saw part, thought not all of Prometheus. Saved from the rest of it by Thanksgiving day football. In my opinion, it was dog of a movie anyway. The development from the premise was shallow and implausible, and the characters a collection of cardboard boobies. The captain might be the sole exception, but perhaps that was deliberate. He at least passably comes across as someone who could be a service academy graduate who acts &#8220;black&#8221; simply because he likes doing it. Most likely, the reason he was was cast and developed that way was because if his character was too much an idiotic stereotype, the film would have fallen apart entirely. I doubt the captain part was written as a black part. Basically fare for teenagers and post adolescent stoners. Even the visual virtuosity got boring pretty quick. Yuck.</p>

<p>Is this writer for real? If anything, Munich glorified jews murdering non-jews. Every death of a goy happened on screen in full gory detail while every jewish death occurred off-screen, like it was something so horrible it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be portrayed.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-153380" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This from a column by D. G. Martin, host of UNC-TV&rsquo;s &ldquo;North Carolina Bookwatch&rdquo;: </p>
<p>According to Escott, Lincoln never significantly altered the racial views he outlined in an 1858 debate with Stephen Douglas: &#8220;I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races &hellip; there is a physical difference between the white and black races which will ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together, there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I, as much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Lincoln preferred a plan that would separate blacks by sending them to colonies in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>In July 1862, he tried to sell his colonization plan to a group of free blacks on the basis of a need to separate: &#8220;Why-should the people of your race be colonized, and where? You and we are different races. We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races. Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss, but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both &hellip;. If this be admitted, it affords a reason at least why we should be separated. It is better for both, therefore, to be separated.&#8221;</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s efforts on behalf of colonization of blacks before he issued the Emancipation Proclamation are well known, but he pursued colonization of blacks for a least a year AFTER he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. Excerpt from &#8220;Book: Lincoln sought to deport freed slaves,&#8221; By Stephen Dinan, The Washington Times, February 9, 2011:</p>
<p>&#8220;… What we know now is he [Lincoln] did continue the effort for at least a year after the proclamation was signed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. [Phillip] Magness [George Mason University researcher] said the key documents he and his co-author, Sebastian N. Page, a junior research fellow at Oxford, found were in British archives, and included an order authorizing a British colonial agent to begin recruiting freed slaves to be sent to the Caribbean in June 1863.</p>
<p>&#8220;By early 1864, the scheme had fallen apart, with British officials fretting over the legality of the Emancipation Proclamation and the risk that the South could still win the war, and with the U.S. Congress questioning how the money was being spent.&#8221;</p>

Directed by Steven Spielberg, and starring Daniel Day-Lewis as U.S. president Abraham Lincoln, the historical drama about Lincoln&rsquo;s fight to put an end to slavery in the United States has mostly received enthusiastic acclaim. Lincoln currently enjoys a 94% approval rating and 8.4/10 average among Rotten Tomatoes&lsquo; top critics. (Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s historical drama.)</p>
<p>Lincoln&lsquo;s per-theater average, $24,364 on Friday, could well reach $75,000 by Sunday evening. If so, that&rsquo;ll land Lincoln somewhere around the top 30 highest weekend per-theater averages ever<br/>

The fact that Lincoln believed blacks to be inferior and sought for them to emigrate after the war, the fact that this is never mentioned about Lincoln, is, by omission, tantamout to a lie. As if one made a movie about Hitler that only dealt his fondness for dogs and his interest in architecture.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-154006" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>November 19, 2012–Spielberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lincoln,&rdquo; which expanded to 1775 theaters nationwide on Friday, November 16, outpaced expectations by grossing over $21 million at the weekend box office.</p>
<p>This is good news for serious dramatic pictures in a landscape dominated by spectacles and action-adventures.</p>
<p>Last weekend, opening exclusively in 11 theaters nationwide, &ldquo;Lincoln&rdquo; pulled in a strong box office performance of just under $1 million. The film played in Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Seattle, Toronto and Washington, D.C., and averaged a prodigious $85,846 per screen.</p>
<p>The film, starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook and Tommy Lee Jones, has grossed nearly $22.5 million in its first 10 days of release.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lincoln&rdquo; is a revealing drama that focuses on the 16th President&rsquo;s tumultuous final months in office. In a nation divided by war and the strong winds of change, Lincoln pursues a course of action designed to end the war, unite the country and abolish slavery. With the moral courage and fierce determination to succeed, his choices during this critical moment will change the fate of generations to come.</p>
<p>No doubt, &ldquo;Lincoln&rdquo; benefited from strong critical support: According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film received 90 percent positive reviews, many grading it giving it as an A ot A- film.<br/>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-153403" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>In the election campaign of 1860, Republican presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln did nothing to quiet the stream of Northern invective. When Northern agitators spoke of the South they imagined only gross cruelty and inequity; they saw only whips, chains, and Simon Legree. There was in their minds no room for accommodation, no possibility of conciliation. Most of all there was no awareness that their own obsessive demands for radical change served to promote bitterness and disorder, and at best would only substitute a new set of cruelties and inequities for the old.</p>
<p>Their dehumanization of Southerners was by then so complete and thoroughgoing that it permeates and colors the Northern imagination and attitudes even unto the present day. The demonization of stereotyped Southerners remains an article of Northern faith––for Liberals, for the Democrat Party, for the mass media, for textbooks, for Steven Spielberg, Hollywood, and television, and also among influential Republicans, including former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, and among many conservatives as well.</p>
<p>As the war progressed, with Northern defeats and casualties mounting, Northerners found it necessary to reach deeper into their ideological took kit, to reexamine their ideals and values, and to convince themselves that their sacrifices were being made for something greater than &#8220;the sacred Union,&#8221; indeed for the very highest ideals––for &#8220;a new birth of freedom,&#8221; to end slavery, for &#8220;the proposition that all men are created equal,&#8221; and even fighting a Holy War for God. The Union war dead were compared to countless Christs, whose rivers of blood would purify the land, atone for Southern sin, and cleanse America for her divinely appointed mission to redeem the world. In words that might have been spoken by John Brown, it was God&rsquo;s will that &#8220;every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword.&#8221; And so Lincoln embarked on a war of unlimited objectives, a total war, a war without mercy, and the first ideological war of the industrial age.</p>
<p>In the course of deploying overwhelming military force to destroy the Confederate States of America, Lincoln could not reasonably have hoped to achieve his avowed purpose of preserving the Union. For the thing he finally conquered bore no resemblance to the thing that he had sought to recover, but was rather a smoking ruin, a burned-out husk, inhabited by half-starved widows, orphans, and battle-scarred cripples, each of them unrepentant Rebels, and in the prophetic words of Edmund Burke, a thing greatly &#8220;depreciated, sunk, wasted, and consumed in the contest.&#8221; To preserve the Union, Lincoln had again and again been &#8220;obliged to depreciate the value of freedom itself.&#8221; Edmund Burke, Speech to Parliament on Conciliation with the Colonies (1775).</p>
<p>And what of the &#8220;government of the people, by the people, for the people&#8221;? It was Lincoln who said it, but it was the Confederates who fought and died for it.</p>

<p>This is what I tell people all the time who think that slave owners just walked around all day whipping their slaves. It makes no sense to whip a slave for no reason. It is like whipping a horse or ox. Slaves owners were responsible for their slaves action. If their slave damaged someone&rsquo;s property, the slave owner had to pay.</p>
<p>What percentage of slaves were whipped? Less than the percentage of blacks in jail today for committing crimes.</p>
<p>Where whites whipped? Yessum sir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But let us not forget that it is poetry, not logic; beauty, not sense. Think of the argument in it. Put it into the cold words of everyday. The doctrine is simply this: that the Union soldiers who died at Gettysburg sacrificed their lives to the cause of self-determination &mdash;  &lsquo;that government of the people, by the people, for the people,&rsquo; should not perish from the earth. It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Union soldiers in that battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. What was the practical effect of the battle of Gettysburg? What else than the destruction of the old sovereignty of the States, i.e., of the people of the States? The Confederates went into battle free; they came out with their freedom subject to the supervision and veto of the rest of the country &mdash; and for nearly twenty years that veto was so effective that they enjoyed scarcely more liberty, in the political sense, than so many convicts in the penitentiary.&rdquo;  &mdash;  Journalist H.L. Mencken, From &ldquo;Five Men at Random,&rdquo; &ldquo;Prejudices: Third Series,&rdquo; 1922, pp. 171-76: First printed, in part, in the &ldquo;Smart Set,&rdquo; May, 1920, p. 141</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-153590" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Lincoln at Gettysburg argued that the fate of self-determination worldwide was at stake in the conflict, which he described as a test of &#8220;whether that nation [the one founded fourscore and twenty years before] or any nation so conceived and dedicated&#8221; could survive, then or in the future. Any nation. Through this argument, Lincoln proposed the the American Civil War therefore was the utterest fulcrum of world history, and the battle at Gettysburg the very hinge of the world&rsquo;s fate then and forever after.</p>
<p>Hard to say he was not right in many ways. but every idea has it limits. How much effort have we, the United States of America, put forth to make this ideal universal? A lot. Two world wars, two or more cold wars, at least five land wars in Asia, and incessant campaigns against non-European insurgents and non-governmental forces around the world whom we have deemed hostile to universal democracy. Maybe it is time to admit that Lincoln&rsquo;s thesis cannot be applied to every community, people or nation on the earth. We act like we have to make Lincoln&rsquo;s thesis (and Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s) apply everywhere, or die trying. Some, even some liberals and leftists, think we have already. Died trying, that is to say.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-154118" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I appreciate some of your comments which are quite contrary to the contemporary &#8220;political correctness&#8221; ideology. </p>
<p>However, I was wary of this movie because of the black social pressure on everyone to cater to their collective racial prestige, especially since Barack Obama has been in power, but for decades before as well.</p>
<p>It is not any particular plot twist which puts me off, but the artistic license he takes and the creative flourishes which convey antipathy for the gentile white society.</p>
<p>Progressive Jews tend to thrive on the idea they are exempt from the condemnations of gentile white society. Jews tending to be widely distributed among various host cultures have long had a high degree of involvement with international finance.</p>
<p>Perhaps Spielberg would be put off by a historical documentary focusing the role of Jewish financiers in the incitement of war, profiteering from war, and profiting from human exploitation and bondage throughout history. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a bias against Jewish society, but I sure don&rsquo;t appreciate progressive Jews always trying to throw the gentile white society under the bus. This tendency among progressive Jews has increased ever since Barack Obama was elected. </p>
<p>I understand progressive blacks put a lot of coercive pressure on Jews in media, academia and government to be more vindictive in their condemnation of the gentile white society. </p>
<p>Based on this movie review, it seems there were some creative flourishes added by Spielberg to sweeten the movie for progressive blacks and to embitter any gentile whites who are not vehemently condemning their own society already.</p>

<p>Negotiation with a Jew is rarely settled by the first round. Not that I consider it tedious. As long as we&rsquo;re not talking in circles.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t find it necessary to impugn Stephen Spielberg with any suspicion of nefarious intentions. It&rsquo;s just that the whole progressive cause was a bad idea from its very inception, and secular Jews are central to the advancement of that cause. </p>
<p>I seek no scapegoats, and when I am ridiculing people, I often ridicule them among their chosen company so that they don&rsquo;t feel singled out. The black / Jew / Feminist alignment has been fairly consistent my whole life, so I like to ridicule them as a set. </p>
<p>Did you notice any part of the movie which was a socially responsible message promoting Feminism? That is all I see missing from this production.</p>

There are a number of studies on leftist, Zionist and grossly pornographic themes which excessively engage Hollywood people, who nevertheless have the money to promote them and to secure excessively favorable puffs in the media. Movies can create and pervert taste, as well as exploit it. Fashions are made or pushed by fashion houses, so to speak.

<p>Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, reunited the Union, and pointed the United States in the direction that lead it to become the strongest and richest country in the world.</p>
<p>If the Civil War had not been fought slavery might still exist. If the Confederacy had won the Civil War the United States would not have been able to defeat twentieth century totalitarianism.</p>
<p>If a victorious Confederacy had eventually freed the slaves, they would have been restricted to a second class citizenship more constraining than Jim Crow Legislation. A civil rights movement in the Confederacy would have been crushed with executions and long prison sentences. I cannot imagine Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. giving his &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech on the steps of the Jefferson Davis Memorial in Richmond, Virginia.</p>

<p>This guy once stated that he lived in San Fransisco and has been robbed by blacks multiple times. This has to be a lie. He must be either a subversive troll or an ADL plant. San Fransisco has a black population of only about 6% - less than half the national average. Does anyone really believe that crap about him being robbed? Multiple times? In a fantastically rich city?</p>
<p>He posts generic comments about blacks here and there (so he won&rsquo;t be banned), then tries to undermine every important story. He even sometimes suggests stories, waits for people to post, and then tries to undermine the story he suggested himself. What does that tell you?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-155218" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>That is certainly a factor. It is why I welcome the decline in the birth rate in countries where it is happening, and why I favor easy access to birth control methods. I also favor legal abortion, although I do not like it. </p>
<p>For as long as perhaps 40,000 years there has been a tension between human population growth, scarcity, and technical advances.</p>
<p>Before 40,000 years ago, when game animals became scarce, humans starved, allowing the population of game animals to grow again. </p>
<p>With the invention of the spear thrower, and later on the invention of the bow and arrow it became possible to hunt smaller, faster animals as the larger animals were hunted to extinction. </p>
<p>The human population grew. As the smaller faster animals became scarce agriculture began. The development of urban civilization made agriculture more efficient. The human population continued to grow. </p>
<p>The industrial revolution made possible the manufacture of cheaper consumer goods, and ever more efficient methods of agriculture. The human population continued to grow.</p>
<p>One can explain the relationship between population, technology, resources, and standard of living with the following equation:</p>
<p>(natural resources x level of technology) / human population = average standard of living</p>
<p>However, a growing population benefits those who are wealthy. More people mean more consumers, and more job applicants. By the law of supply and demand this means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits.</p>
<p>That is why I disagree with those who advocate a higher birth rate for whites. I advocate a lower birth rate for Hispanics and blacks.</p>

You just don&rsquo;t know how constitutional amendment work in the world of progressive-Popular Front political mythology. Breakthrough amendments are somehow passed to advance the causes of people who otherwise are universally reviled. Never mind that they have to be approved by 2/3 of each house of congress and ratified by 3/4 of the states. The foremost example undoubtedly is the 19th Amendment which gave the vote to women. If you listened to the political left, you would think this amendment had been adopted over a phalanx of opposition. Yet it had to get that 2/3 vote in both houses and get ratified by 36 of the 48 states. That it was ratified quickly means that there was not the massive opposition postulated by your local leftist professors and activists. More likely, there were a few states which stood opposed while the rest firmly supported the idea. Round up the usual suspects!</p>

That notion was foisted on the public to make the war a &#8220;noble cause&#8221; when, in fact, it was a &#8220;Noble LIe&#8221;. The war was to prevent the southern States from exercising their constitutional right to separate from the voluntary union of the States. In the process of preventing this voluntary separation, the North killed forever the sovereignty of the various States and brought into being the all-powerful central government we now enjoy.</p>

This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution&hellip;</p>
<p>Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea [than "that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"], its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. </p>

<p>Presented to U.S. Ambassador Charles Francis Adams<br/>
January 28, 1865</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>We congratulate the American people upon your re-election by a large majority. If resistance to the Slave Power was the reserved watchword of your first election, the triumphant war cry of your re-election is Death to Slavery.</p>
<p>From the commencement of the titanic American strife the workingmen of Europe felt instinctively that the star-spangled banner carried the destiny of their class&hellip;</p>
<p>The workingmen of Europe feel sure that, as the American War of Independence initiated a new era of ascendancy for the middle class, so the American Antislavery War will do for the working classes. They consider it an earnest of the epoch to come that it fell to the lot of Abraham Lincoln, the single-minded son of the working class, to lead his country through the matchless struggle for the rescue of an enchained race and the reconstruction of a social world. </p>

One day in the not so distant future the history books for a non-white amerika will tell about how blacks founded the west and owned plantations worked by European white slaves who were all liberated in a civil war and this nation was always owned and controlled and led by Africans who were always the main players and led the world with their final black jesus Obama being the final messenger prophet before they all die and go to black heaven paradise. Actually they are all half black since full miscegenation would have made 500 million Baracks and whites would have long vanished from existence.<br/>
Dont worry because we already see everything being turned upside down and revised.<br/>
Victors always rewrite history. Didnt Hollywood&rsquo;s Planet of the Apes in 1969 warn of coming events all the way down to the ape jesus messiah? And dont even mention King Kong and his love of blondes first made in 1939. </p>
<p>Does Lincoln even look white or does he look like some mongoloid khazar breed? A new book is out now by a negro Harvard professor female called The Heningess of Monticello alleging again how Jefferson fucked the slave bitch and had many kids and they rule the world &hellip;. and of course how Amerika got the jump on the rest of the world with &#8220;equality&#8221; &hellip;<br/>
Jefferson and Madison are both rotting and burning in hell it is hoped &hellip;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-153866" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Until the Civil War became a war to end slavery the South probably had the better case legally. After the Emancipation Proclamation, the Confederacy certainly had the worst case morally.</p>
<p>One should not idealize the antebellum South. The institution of slavery was harmful to the economic interests of the vast majority of Southern whites who could not afford slaves. Wages were higher in the North. There were more economic opportunities there. </p>
<p>Abolitionist agitation, and even the ability of abolitionists to state their argument was illegal in the South. During the campaign of 1860 Abraham Lincoln was not allowed to campaign in the South. He was not on the ballot in Southern states during the election.</p>
<p>The South had an oppressive, authoritarian society where intellectual freedom was denied in order to protect an evil institution.</p>

<p>In a spring survey, 34 percent of likely young voters said they supported Mr. Romney, compared with 51 percent for Mr. Obama. The new survey, conducted from Sept. 19 to Oct. 3 and released on Wednesday, found that Mr. Romney&rsquo;s level of support went to 36 percent, but that Mr. Obama&rsquo;s support had grown to 55 percent.<br/>

<p>Huffington Post 12/29/11 </p>
<p>Young people   &mdash;   the collegiate and post-college crowd, who have served as the most visible face ofthe Occupy Wall Street movement   &mdash;   might be getting more comfortable with socialism. That&rsquo;s the surprising result from a Pew Research Center poll that aims to measure American sentiments toward different political labels&hellip;</p>
<p>socialism has more fans than opponents among the 18-29 crowd. Forty-nine percent of people in that age bracket say they have a positive view of socialism; only 43 percent say they have a negative view.<br/>

<p>The Orientals I have known as friends, neighbors, fellow students, and co-workers have been neither &#8220;boring automatons,&#8221; nor were they &#8220;humorless,&#8221; nor were the females &#8220;good for perverted sex.&#8221; </p>
<p>Indeed, Oriental women are less prone to engage in sex outside of marriage than white women, and they are less prone to have illegitimate children than white women.</p>
<p>In his &#8220;RACE, EVOLUTION, AND BEHAVIOR,&#8221; Professor J. Philippe Rushton, who spoke at six American Renaissance Conferences, has this to say of Oriental sexuality: &#8220;Orientals are the least sexually active, whether measured by age of first intercourse, intercourse frequency, or number of sexual partners. Blacks are the most active on all of these. Once again Whites are in between.&#8221;<br/>
<a href="../../../Race_Evolution_Behavior.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlesdarwinresearch.org/Race_Evolution_Behavior.pdf</a> </p>
<p>Low crime rates and high IQs for Orientals are not my projection. They are pointed out by Professor Rushton, and amply documented by every study of those splendid people that I have read.</p>

Those are facts that are not in serious dispute. By every criterion that whites are superior to blacks Orientals are superior to whites. </p>
<p>Anything else is one&rsquo;s subjective response to them. I have liked and admired them since childhood because of those facts, and because I have always had good experiences with the Orientals I have known.</p>

When it comes to people with very high IQs, Europeans vastly outnumber orientals. You&rsquo;ll also have to explain away all the innovations created by white man that surpassed the Orientals by leaps and bounds. Thanks for the gunpowder though. </p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t have anything against Orientals except that they vote overwhelmingly for Democrats and are natural statists even though they have a good work ethic and family values. So just like how neocons say Hispanics are &#8216;natural Republicans&rsquo;, you would think Asians who are successful would gravitate to Republican party but they don&rsquo;t. They are loyal robots to the state and we don&rsquo;t need them.</p>

<p>Although I read Karl Marx for insight, I was never a Marxist. </p>
<p>The writers I were attracted to were Michael Harrington, I.F. Stone, and Bertrand Russell, among others on the democratic left. In retrospect I think that the War on Poverty, which Michael Harrington inspired, was a bad policy, although it was not dishonest and immoral like supply side economics.</p>
<p>I am glad that the United States did not become more involved in the Chinese Civil War between the Communists and the Nationalists. Nevertheless, I think that the government of Taiwan is superior to that on the mainland. </p>
<p>China&rsquo;s misfortune, and that of the world, is that after the death of Sun Yat Sen in 1925 no leader of his moral stature rose to govern the Chinese. Mao Tse Tung and Chaing Kai Shek were dictators who valued personal power more than the good of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>1. I do have Harrington&rsquo;s interesting and valuable &#8220;The Accidental Century&#8221; (1965).</p>
<p>2. &#8220;No sense denying I.F. Stone was a Soviet Agent&#8221;, Commentary, January 1970.</p>
<p>3. Bertrand Russell, a brilliant mathematician and philosopher, who had contemplated atom bombing Moscow and a decade later led our unilateral nuclear disarmament campaign, once asserted that the &#8220;problems raised by nuclear energy are not such that a politician&rsquo;s training enables him to understand&#8221; - unlike the student of &#8220;theoretical physics&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely it is nonsense to suggest that no-one else understands what happens when you drop an H-bomb except a physicist&hellip;.For once Lord Russell talked the purest essence of nonsense. As Aristotle remarked to King Alexander when his royal pupil caught him in a most embarrassing position: &#8216;Your Majesty will observe how passion can debase even the most exalted intellect&rsquo;.&#8221; (Oswald Mosley, April 1958)</p>
<p>Still they don&rsquo;t make &#8216;em quite like that any more, not even in China.</p>
<p>4. Mao &amp; Chiang: so the Chinese were not that clever, at any rate in the political sphere. And as for US interference, read Anthony Kubek&rsquo;s &#8220;How the Far East was Lost&#8221; (1963/71).</p>

It has been years since I have read his accounts, but he was critical of what he observed. Shortly before returning to the United States he write in his Weekly that he was aware that some of his readers were disappointed that he was not more positive. Then he wrote - I am fairly confident these were his exact words - &#8220;This is not a good society, and it is not run by honest men.&#8221; He wrote those words in italics.</p>

Ironically, that is exactly the archetypal Hollywood image of certain ethnic groups&hellip;i.e. blondes = dumb, blacks fall into 2 stereotypes= Super intelligent magic &#8220;side kick&#8221; who saves the day or the street thug, Asians= nerds with no sense of emotion etc.</p>
<p>Despite the reservations against Hollywood in general, you seem to have taken a page directly from the H&rsquo;wood manifesto.<br/>
Asians are just s interesting or boring like anybody else. Some would say whites are too boring and stiff, does that make such stereotypes true? Of course NOT!<br/>
Asians can be funny, interesting and versatile folks. Some of the funniest, creative &amp; most interesting people I know are east Asian &amp; Asian Indian. Jackie Chan for example is probably one of the funniest most entertaining and skilled movie celebrities alive today. He directs, produces, stars, does all his comic reliefs, dialogues, stunts ( probably some of the best stunts ever choreographed in human history for a movies) in his movies. He also writes the scripts, directs the fight/ action choreography and composes his own soundtrack/ music score for his movies - ALL in ONE! AND, he does an AWESOME job, his movies are huge hits worldwide across races, continents, languages and genders. Show me ONE, just ONE western movie star who has half the capability &amp; genius of Mr Chan.</p>

Talking a lot of jive<br/>
Fussing and a fighting<br/>
Might lose their lives</p>
<p>You better raise your head up high<br/>
Or else you might be dead<br/>
You run around, jiving<br/>
But don&rsquo;t you be afraid, &rsquo;cause</p>

I say, we got to live together<br/>
Whoa, oh</p>

It&rsquo;s all right, &rsquo;cause<br/>
Yes, we know everything</p>

<p>According to current figures from Immigration and Customs Enforcement   &mdash;   the federal agency responsible for deportations   &mdash;   Obama has removed 1.4 million people during his 42 months in office so far. Technically, that&rsquo;s fewer than under George W. Bush, whose cumulative total was 2 million. But Bush&rsquo;s number covers eight full years, which doesn&rsquo;t allow an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>
<p>If you instead compare the two presidents&rsquo; monthly averages, it works out to 32,886 for Obama and 20,964 for Bush, putting Obama clearly in the lead. Bill Clinton is far behind with 869,676 total and 9,059 per month. All previous occupants of the White House going back to 1892 fell well short of the level of the three most recent presidents.<br/>

In a reversal from 2008, employees of financial-services companies have given most of their $128 million and counting in 2012 political donations to groups and candidates on the right.</p>
<p>In 2008 Wall Street loved Barack Obama. Four years later, even after billions in bailout money went to the banks under Obama&rsquo;s watch, the tide has turned &mdash; by about $20 million.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/19/wall-street-turncoats-the-money-guys-loved-obama-in-08-this-year-romney-s-their-man.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/19/wall-street-turncoats-the-money-guys-loved-obama-in-08-this-year-romney-s-their-man.html</a></p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>As long as our present system of legal bribery continues the Democrats will need to get their contributions where they can. </p>
<p>The Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission Supreme Court decision of 2010, which overturned decades of legislation regulating corporate spending on campaigns was a large step in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s Lincoln deviates from the traditional portrayal of the 16th U.S. president by fleshing out the mind of a person willing to risk everything for the abolition of slavery. Spielberg based his film on parts of Team of Rivals, a book by Doris Kearns Goodwin. He makes Abraham Lincoln relevant today by presenting a cunning political mind navigating Washington&rsquo;s all too familiar divisions, gridlock, and power plays&hellip;</p>
<p>Spielberg&rsquo;s Lincoln will head to the Oscars. But more important, it will make history.</p>

<p>1.) The flick actually does show Gen. Lee for a moment, surrendering to Grant. Both doffed their hats at each other and proved themselves to be gentlemen. Lee was not shown to be some Ralph Fienes N**i.</p>
<p>2.) The Vice President of the Confederacy, Alexander Stephens was actually shown pretty accurately. He was in fact a hard-core White Supremacist, that is just the fact of the matter.</p>
<p>3.) There is one scene where President Lincoln has a conversation with a Black Lady (one of his White House maids?). The Black Lady says that many Whites want to send the Blacks back to Africa. President Lincoln then states in effect that perhaps Whites and Blacks <b>may</b> in time be able to live together. Hey that is a pretty big opening and is open to alot of interpretation. Given the ongoing Black Flash Mobs (and even just the events of the last Black Fridays shopping riots, mostly with Blacks) one can see that &#8216;America&rsquo; is just not going to work out.</p>
<p>4.) Alot of these neo-Confederates out there need to finally just let it go. The Old South was full of Negroes! Even today many Southern States are chock full of Blacks (I think Missouri is really close to having a Black Majority, something that hasn&rsquo;t happened for awhile) <b>As a White Nationalist I want a White Ethno-State free of the presence of criminally prone Blacks! Something akin to: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territorial_Imperative" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territorial_Imperative</a> </b> The South just doesn&rsquo;t come close to that ideal and so all this neo-Confederate jaberwocky is mostly a waste of time in my view.    </p>
<p><b>Lets leave Lincoln in the past and get to work with the new burgeoning Successionist Movement that has come into being as a healthy reaction to the re-appointment of Dictator Barrack Ogabe.  To the future!</b></p>

There is much to learn from &#8220;Cultural Marxist&#8221; techniques, but in opposition to the  hateful world they are trying to create.  Meanwhile, we make sure we have enough children and grandchildren, and educate them in western civilization.  The New Century Foundation has a role to play.</p>

I can&rsquo;t blame them for defending their heritage-particularly when it is criticized to an unhealthy degree by the left.  </p>
<p>The war was truly about the economic system of slavery.  With the increase of Northern abolitionism which hated slavery and the expansion of Americans westward, both sides found themselves in more places to build up bitterness toward one another.  All one has to do is look at conflicts in the 1850s between Free State settlers and pro-slavery sympathizers in places like Kansas and Missouri.  One side saw slavery as the greatest evil and needed to be stopped while the other had been operating peaceably under this system for generations.  To the South, if they didn&rsquo;t do something their sovereignty and rights would vanish.  And to the North, any expansion of slavery or Southern autonomy was a threat.  To simply cede in this conflict would only beget trouble later on as both sides moved westward.</p>
<p> What does bother me is when Southerners claim war wasn&rsquo;t wanted.  When Ft. Sumter was attacked and the Confederacy established, it was done because the South wanted war.  They knew what they were doing.  Sadly, on top of our 600,000 white dead Christian American ancestors who died, the political/social battles regarding race and diversity fought since have been thoroughly damaging to traditional white Americans of any state.</p>

I am utterly shocked. Along the way attacking whites and making blacks look like Saints. Was this movie the &#8220;Machete&#8221; of the civil war?  Or &#8220;Django Unchained&#8221;? </p>
<p>Yes, Hollywood has a sick fetish when it comes to genocidal themes regarding the destruction of whites. So of course they would get off on telling a story about the War of Northern Aggression and the genocide of southern whites. </p>
<p>I am sure many wonderful quotes from Lincoln were ignored in this accurate movie.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could save The Union without freeing any slaves, 				I would do it&#8221;   &mdash;   Abraham Lincoln, in a letter to Horace Greeley</p>
<p>&#8220;Negro equality? Fudge!&#8221;   &mdash;   Abraham Lincoln, 				Fragments: Notes for Speeches, Sept. 1859 (Vol. III)</p>
<p>&#8220;Free them, and make 				them politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will 				not admit of this&hellip;. We cannot, then, make them equals.&#8221;   &mdash;   				Abraham Lincoln, &#8220;Lincoln&rsquo;s Reply to Douglas,&#8221; p. 444</p>
<p>&#8220;What I would most desire would 				be the separation of the white and black races.&#8221;   &mdash;    				Abraham Lincoln, Spoken at Springfield, Illinois on July 				17th, 1858; from Abraham Lincoln: Complete Works, 1894, Volume 				1, page 273</p>
<p>&#8220;I acknowledge the constitutional 				rights of the States, not grudgingly, but fairly and fully, and 				I will give them any legislation for reclaiming their fugitive 				slaves.&#8221;   &mdash;   Abraham Lincoln in speeches at Peoria, 				Illinois</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no purpose directly or 				indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the 				States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do 				so, and I have no inclination to do so.&#8221; Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s 				Inaugural Address on the Capitol steps, 1861</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the people of the South really 				entertain fear that a Republican administration would directly 				or indirectly interfere with their slaves, or with them about 				their slaves? If they do, I wish to assure you as once a friend, 				and still, I hope, not an enemy, that there is no cause for 				such fears. The South would be in no more danger in this respect 				than it was in the days of Washington.&#8221;   &mdash;   Letter from Abraham 				Lincoln to A.H. Stephens, Public and Private Letters of 				Alexander Stephens, p. 150</p>
<p>&#8220;Any people anywhere, being 			inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up and 			shake off the existing government and to form one that suits 			them better. Nor is this right confined to cases in which the 			people of an existing government may choose to exercise it. Any 			portion of such people that can, may make their own of such 			territory as they inhabit. More than this, a majority of any 			portion of such people may revolutionize, putting down a 			minority intermingling with or near them who oppose their 			movement.&#8221;   &mdash;   Abraham Lincoln on the floor of Congress, 			January 12, 1848, Congressional Globe, Appendix 1st Session 30th 			Congress, page 94</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a despotic and imperial government can 			coerce seceding states&#8221; - William Seward, U.S. Secretary of State 			under Abraham Lincoln on 10 April 1861 to Charles Francis Adams, 			Minister to the Court of St. James (Britain)</p>
<p>Lincoln was a hypocrite, liar, tyrant and  dictator. He comes off as a sociopath to me. Or as a politician.</p>

<p>You have a big ego. Unfortunately, your high self image is unjustified. Your strong opinions are not substantiated by intelligence and learning, but emotion. Humans share emotions with other mammals. What separates some humans from the rest of the class mammalia is the ability to evaluate evidence and weigh arguments.  </p>
<p>I am a race realist. I believe that genes are considerably more important than anything else in determining not only ability levels, but personality and character.I also believe that the genes that determine ability levels.   personalty, and character are distributed unequally among the races, so that racial differences are intractable. </p>
<p>In all of this I agree almost entirely with Professor J. Philippe Rushton, who spoke at six American Renaissance conferences.</p>
<p> <a href="../../../Race_Evolution_Behavior.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlesdarwinresearch.org/Race_Evolution_Behavior.pdf</a></p>
<p>I only disagree with Professor Rushton in his explanation of how racial differences evolved. I think the evolution of racial differences was better explained in &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution.&#8221; This received a favorable review that was posted in American Renaissance here:</p>
<p><a href="/ar/2009/05/index.html#article1" rel="nofollow">/ar/2009/05/index.html#article1</a>  </p>
<p>Professor Rushton attributes racial differences to evolving in different climates. He does not explain why the Neanderthals, who evolved in Europe during several ice ages, were less intelligent than the Cro Magnons who displaced them. </p>
<p>The authors of &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion,&#8221; professors Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, attribute racial differences to the different amounts of time the different races have been exposed to agriculture and urban civilization. Professors Rushton, Cochran, and Harpending have experienced the intolerance of those who, like you, resist exposure to other points of view. </p>
<p>You sirrah are a disgrace to American Renaissance. You are also a danger to it, because you help to shape the image of American Renaissance in the eyes of those who would like to shut it down and prevent future American Renaissance conferences. They want to convince others that the American Renaissance community consists of ignorant, irrational haters like you.</p>

Yours is the point of view I can get by turning on day-time TV, other than your (probably) visceral dislike of black people which you try to pretty up with some sociology.  So you subscribe to the AR point of view on blacks, but you vote for Obama, and so enable everything that AR warns about.  Have you ever gone to an Obama rally and mentioned what a big fan of Phillipe Rushton you are?  I&rsquo;m sure that would go over big.  You are not worth listening to, you are a preening nitwit.</p>

Then came the 4 years fierce resistance from the white race conscious christian right (evangelicals, catholics, etc), the &#8220;tea baggers&#8221;, glenn becks, faux news, limbaughs, ted nugents, ann coulters, laura ingrahams, armed pro gun militias etc who desperately tried to get rid of President Obama, trying in vain to thwart and undermine his reign. BUT, all in vain&hellip;..In Nov 7, 2012 history was made again, when despite all the collective resistance by the majority of whites ( I personally know many race conscious white christians as friends or coworkers  who went out to vote  for Mittens just to be rid of Obama) President Barak Hussein Obama was RE-ELECTED as the President of the United States of America, thereby DEFEATING &amp; destroying ALL his collective enemies and detractors (white race conscious conservative christians who believe in the &#8220;traditional America&#8221; BS)</p>
<p>Well, now all these right wing pro life, pro war, pro gun race conscious white conservative christians can do is whine like a bunch of sorry pussies through right wing media outlets and moan like whores on various right wing websites. To them I say - cry me a river and get a life-losers!</p>

NO. Since 1865 circa era, the south and all her sympathizers (that includes race conscious white christians from the north, east and west too) have progressively LOST their ground and WILL keep losing their ground until they become serfs to their non white masters in their own land. All your guns, ammo, bibles, out of control low IQ hicks and conservative views will be of NO help in this inevitable future.</p>
<p>As for victorious Israel. Heck, we have NEVER lost a single war ever since we were created in 1948. In that time, we have managed to kick the butts of the Babylonians, Arabs, Persians and all our former enemies.Today Greece, Italy and the Arab islamic world are economic and cultural basket cases with NO viable future. Meanwhile Israel continues to kicks butt and WIN as efficient, advanced and progressive uber state in terms of science, technology, research, culture, music, arts, political power and military finesse. Israel and her influential wings and people practically control the politics and economy of the United States. The best part is that you know it and I know it and you know that I know that you know it <img src="../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/>  Deal with it boy!

Where did the south ever rise? Answer: NEVER! Since 1865, the south &amp; her sympathizers all over the nation have progressively LOST ground and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>As for victorious Israel - Far from it we have smashed all our enemies i.e. Arabs, Babylonians, Persians etc. And while we have managed to successfully build a super advanced 1st world, vibrant, technological, scientific, economic and military uber state which is powerful enough to muscle and deeply command America&rsquo;s political, economic and cultural policies, the pathetic epic failures of our times i.e. Greece and Italy are shinning examples of epic losers in modern times. These two nations, especially Greece are economic &amp; social basket cases with NO viable future. They are going the way of the dinosaurs. And compared to us Israelis/ Jews, the insignificant greeks and italians are nowhere even close to comparison in terms of our envious economic, scientific, technological, political, military, cultural, media and academic success &amp; clout we enjoy in the most powerful circles in the world.</p>
<p>Israel = AWESOME!</p>

I&rsquo;m a Yankee and I don&rsquo;t believe in slavery. But I also realize the slavery that existed here wasn&rsquo;t all that bad by comparison to slavery as it existed down through the ages. Also, there is the point that though mechanization, slavery was doomed here. It would&rsquo;ve only lasted a few more years and wouldn&rsquo;t have been worth keeping slaves anymore.<br/>
   The new phase I spoke of was black equality. That was a great mistake. Now that we know of the error, we should move to remove the blacks from This nation. Humanely of course, but removed they must be. for their own good.</p>

<p>Can you imagine how unrealistic that comment would be for someone like Lincoln at that time in our history.</p>
<p>Never mind David and Solomon never spoke even one word in the old testament of concern or interest in helping any oppressed races other than their own jewish race.And Jesus was the one who constantly spoke of the importance of helping the poor and the oppressed and the widows and orphans.</p>
<p>Solomon was too busy collecting wealth and pagan wives and David was busy spying on Uriah&rsquo;s wife Bathsheba as she was bathing on her roof and then he sent uriah to the front so he could get killed and leave Bathsheba a widow so  David could marry her.<br/>
I don&rsquo;t think either of those would have been Lincoln&rsquo;s idols, LOL.<br/>
Those lines by Kushner and Spielberg definitely had an agenda, I guess they couldn&rsquo;t bear to have their characters refer to Jesus in a positive way in their movie.</p>

Otherwise  this entire mess would have never happened. It is clear now that African slaves were needed like a hole in the head and African slavery was simply terrible economics that hurt the white labor force while opening the door for serpent Marx to slither in to sink his fangs into brains and inject his deadly venom. The past 500 years has been bizarre and lethal to say the least and should have been avoided.<br/>
Invent a time machine to reverse it all like Superman reversed the earth rotation. Erase this terrible heinous crime against an entire race and civilization. Arrest and execute all African slave traders or potential slave traders. It was never meant to happen and a complete miscalculated misguided monumental mistake. Blacks would all be happily back in their new world order natural environment and never been subjected to this terrible slave tragedy inflicted on them that needs to be corrected with advanced technological reverse time travel.</p>

However, the comments below are just as cookie cutter as evarrr. First of all, the Midwest, which it seems is what many of your call &#8220;real America&#8221;, is idealized only by the low IQ hicks that lives in those parts or by white people who&rsquo;ve never been there, much like the leftists who have embraced a sort of hipster version of &#8220;Buddhism&#8221; idealize Tibet as this Garden of Eden against which we must measure the current surroundings. Idealizing the middle class is just plain stupid. After all, it&rsquo;s the middle class that&rsquo;s a hotbed of neoliberalism, or that obnoxious Jimbo, philistine, arrogant neoconservatism that makes true conservatives puke. The cities and towns are just as F-ed, although in different ways. Residents of both are equally annoying. </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that the problem is a religious one. Do you know why men have either degenerated into limp-wristed coffee shop waiters or those obnoxious secretly gay, gym macho, chip-on-their-shoulder, often meatheaded mockeries of true masculinity? It&rsquo;s because the culture has distorted the image of men, and both Protestantism and Catholicism have become not those forces which inspire men towards true masculinity  &mdash;  which is the noble, humble but not stupid or subservient sacrificial attitude towards the true, the good, and the beautiful  &mdash;  but bedfellows of the establishment. Protestantism was real conforming willingly with the putrid currents of the culture long before Catholicism finally caved in and Protestantized itself in the 60s. But let&rsquo;s not stop there. Women are a disgrace as well. Women have been a disgrace in this country for longer than we can fault feminism for (feminism contributed, but you can&rsquo;t lay it all on feminism, and feminism did raise a few good points). Einstein already commented in the 1920s how he&rsquo;d never seen, in all his travels in the world, such a sad state of affairs among women as he had seen in the US (google for it). I&rsquo;m willing to you trace the dour state of affairs of both sexes in the US to the Puritans of Taxachusetts. After all, who were most immigrants who came to the US (and face it, all white people are the product of immigrants)? The weirdos. They were the weird religious freaks that no one wanted to deal with in Europe. People with weird ideas. Fortunately, as long as the US remained a decentralized bunch of states full of little societies that generally left each other alone, no one in the world cared. The craziness of Crazy Dave or the gayness of Gay Steve were his business as long as his stayed in his forest shack. Even that despicable American pragmatism, which is the substrate for many of the countries woes, went undisturbed. But as soon as the desire for empire infected the minds of American politicians and the media machine, this is where the stinking maw of hell was flung open. Depravity had a place to stand and a long level to move the world with. </p>
<p>Now, the US isn&rsquo;t the only source of things corrupting the Western world, to be sure. But it shares, by far, most of the burden. Now, you cannot love what you don&rsquo;t know. If you refuse to know your country, as both left and right these days do, for what it truly is, how can you love it? What you love is a fantasy, or a figment, drawn from your imagination. Love for one&rsquo;s country is the desire and the courage to take a good hard look at the flaws it has. All of them. They could have been flaws that preceded the founding of the country. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I understand this is a terribly difficult thing for us Americans to do. After all, the only thing that many think makes the American people American are political objects, or worse, economic ideas. Economics and politics are important aspect of social life, but it is a hideous and shallow thing to reduce life to any of them. Perhaps common history is a proper way to identify. It&rsquo;s hard to say. I&rsquo;m not prepared to answer the question. America is, after all, like Australia or Canada, a very different kind of country than the countries of the Old World where national identity, while not cut and dry, is very stable. The fact that no true distinctly American high culture exists or likely could exist without major changes in the way &#8220;American&#8221; is defined is a sad reality. Perhaps we must resign ourselves to the idea of a &#8220;society of societies&#8221;. Such a move would require a reversion to a more decentralized US of the past, before the feds seized control. </p>
<p>As far as &#8220;ethnic whites&#8221; are concerned, I would be careful not to stereotype (ironically, you&rsquo;re falling into the stereotype of the stereotyping American by doing so, and it&rsquo;s a thing Americans need to overcome, along with the &#8220;pity attitude&#8221; towards immigrants or people of other countries. Travel a little instead of idealizing home.). What you&rsquo;re likely seeing are working class immigrants with little true appreciation, respect, or even knowledge of their homeland&rsquo;s culture (and hence the readiness of some to adopt what you call wiggerish tendencies). However, what you don&rsquo;t appear to be noticing is the vast presence of &#8220;ethnic whites&#8221; (which is a degrading and stupid term, I might add. The only difference between us and them is either the degree of assimilation or the degree of integration) in the middle and upper classes. There is a disproportionate degree of wealth and education among immigrants and their children in America, and not just among Asian immigrants. The average white American looks like a loser next to these people who have made good use of the opportunities available here. Again, it&rsquo;s not as if America is inherently and the only &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221;. But many of those who have come to the US have made very good use of what&rsquo;s here economically speaking, much better use than Americans do. I attribute this in part to the ethos and culture they brought with them. I see integration as preferable to something as despotic as assimilation. However, if there is any distaste for assimilation, it&rsquo;s not surprising. The US doesn&rsquo;t present an attractive thing to assimilate into. Assimilation would constitute a culture downgrade. Americans who don&rsquo;t realize this are unfortunately ignorant of culture and history, lacking in any deep understanding of them and instead dealing in the cheap cliches that feel good and allow us to dismiss the superiority of others in many areas (these do not include the Magic, Baby Daddy Negro, btw, or the turdish 21st century white man). </p>
<p>G. K. Chesterton once wrote, at the beginning of the century, that the madness of tomorrow would come not from Moscow, but from Manhattan. At around the same time, Pius X predicted the fallout of the superheresy of modernism. I think both are predictions are, to men of unhazy wits, on the money. Listening to blacks moan in the stagnation of the ghetto, and the leftists who keep them there, may be annoying, but the whole constellation of problems everyone here likes to moan about is part of a far larger phenomenon. We can&rsquo;t dance around it anymore. We can&rsquo;t pretend the moral decay of our country, and the world, isn&rsquo;t a reality. We can&rsquo;t pretend we are responsible for letting it happen.</p>
