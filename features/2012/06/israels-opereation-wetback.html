	                	<p>In 1954, President Eisenhower gave orders to deport illegal Mexican immigrants. The Immigration and Naturalization Service went door to door in California, Texas, and New Mexico, and caught and deported 130,000. During the same period more than 1,000,000 illegals voluntary went back to Mexico.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks, Israeli authorities have shown similar resolve in deporting Africans, who have been sneaking into the country in ever-increasing numbers. With a boldness that every Western country should imitate, the Israelis have mandated expulsion for the explicit purpose of keeping their country Jewish &mdash; even for keeping it <em>white</em>. Once the government made up its mind that the Africans had to go, it went into action very quickly.</p>
<p>Anti-immigrant sentiment had been building for months, with the Israeli paper <em>Haaretz</em> running headlines such as &ldquo;<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-police-unemployed-african-refugees-turning-tel-aviv-beaches-into-high-crime-spots-1.427634">Unemployed African Refugees Turning Tel Aviv Beaches Into High Crime Spots</a>.&rdquo; Things came to a head in May, after police arrested four Eritreans and Sudanese who had raped a 19-year-old woman, and Interior Minister Eli Yishai said that African illegals should be <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/news/interior-minister-we-must-deport-african-refugees/2012/05/16/">rounded up and deported</a>.</p>
<p>Later that month, several members of the Israeli Knesset addressed <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/hundreds-demonstrate-in-south-tel-aviv-against-illegal-migrants-1.432228">demonstrators</a> in Tel Aviv who demanded that the Africans be deported. &ldquo;We must expel the infiltrators,&rdquo; said Danny Danon of the Likud party. &ldquo;We should not be afraid to say the words &lsquo;expulsion now&rsquo;.&rdquo; Another Likud Knesset member, Miri Regev, called the immigrants a &ldquo;cancer in our body.&rdquo; Some of the demonstrators rioted, beating Africans and attacking their shops.</p>
<div id="attachment_100298" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 635px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ViolentProtest.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-100298 " title="ViolentProtest" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ViolentProtest.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="360"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Some Israeli protesters turned violent, shattering this car&rsquo;s windows.</p></div>
<p>Just a few days later, on June 3, a <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-enacts-law-allowing-authorities-to-detain-illegal-migrants-for-up-to-3-years-1.434127">new immigration law</a> went into effect, permitting detention of illegals for up to three years, and mandating prison sentences of five to 15 years for anyone helping or sheltering illegals. That same day, Interior Minister Yishai complained that &ldquo;Muslims that arrive here do not even believe that this country belongs to us, to the white man,&rdquo; adding that he would use &ldquo;all the tools to expel the foreigners, until not one infiltrator remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On June 8, the Jerusalem District Court <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20120608-sudan-israel-deportation-netanyahu-yishai-immigrants-eritreans">ruled</a> that South Sudanese illegals could be sent home, since their country was safe. Interior Minister Yishai said he looked forward to court rulings that would permit expulsion of &ldquo;all citizens of Eritrea and North Sudan&rdquo; as well. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his view that it was a top priority to finish a 150-mile wall along the Egyptian border to keep Africans out.</p>
<p>Two days later, the Israeli cabinet approved new <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/156736#.T-MR4HAbu_I">legislation</a> that calls for a five-year jail sentence and stiff fine &mdash; the equivalent of a $130,000 &mdash; for anyone who hires an illegal immigrant. The text of the bill itself calls illegals &ldquo;a strategic threat to Israeli society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On June 11, just three days after the ruling, police started rounding up South Sudanese for deportation. The UN protested, claiming that South Sudan was still too dangerous for repatriation, but Interior Minister Yishai was unmoved. &ldquo;I prefer that there will be criticism of Israel while the state <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/156765#.T-JVVxdfG9H">remains Jewish</a>,&rdquo; he said. One Tel Aviv resident who watched the roundup noted that &ldquo;it must be done or tomorrow we will have no country.&rdquo; Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed, pointing out that immigrants <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/world/middleeast/crackdown-on-african-immigrants-tugs-at-israels-soul.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=4&amp;emc=eta1">threaten the Jewish character of Israel</a>. The Israeli Operation Wetback was underway.</p>
<p>We congratulate the Israelis on their vigorous measures to maintain the nation&rsquo;s character, and look forward to the day when our country can do the same. Needless to say, US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will never be like Interior Minister Yishai. She would never welcome a green light for deporting all Haitian illegals, and add that she hoped to deport all Mexicans and Salvadorans, too. Can we imagine the President of the United States explaining the need for a wall along the Mexican border by pointing out that Mexican immigration &ldquo;threatens the European character of the United States&rdquo;? No, we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<div id="attachment_100299" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 597px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BorderFence.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-100299  " title="BorderFence" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BorderFence.jpg" alt="" width="587" height="392"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Israel-Egypt border wall.</p></div>
<p>These things are a little easier to imagine in Europe, but what would happen to a British or French or &mdash; horrors! &mdash; German official who complained about Muslim immigrants who didn&rsquo;t seem to realize that the country &ldquo;belongs to us, the white man&rdquo;? He would be out of work before he took his next breath, and the US press would erupt in ecstasies of indignation. When these things happen in Israel, the <em>New York Times</em> maintains a dignified silence.</p>
<p>There is, to be sure, a cruel double standard. Any American or European who wants an ethnostate of his own is a frothing bigot, whereas Israelis who want the same thing are heroes in their own country and respectable statesmen here. It is entirely understandable that American patriots should be angry about the double standard, but it is more useful to laud the Israeli example than to complain about it. The Israeli government is doing exactly what we would like our government to do. We should point to Israel as a model and encourage our rulers to copy it rather than grouse about others getting away with things we can&rsquo;t do. We should celebrate this Israeli policy just as we would a similar outbreak of sanity in Canada or Australia.</p>
<p>This is the stance taken by the most successful nationalist parties in Europe. Whether in Austria or Denmark or Belgium or increasingly in France as well, Europeans who oppose Third-World immigration support the Israeli commitment to keeping Israel Jewish. They ask only that their own compatriots recognize that what is good for Israel is also good for Europe.</p>
<p>Likewise, it does no good to complain about American Jews &mdash; and there are many of them &mdash; who support an Israeli ethnostate but insist on multi-culti madness for us. We should congratulate them on the healthy impulses of their Israeli cousins, and invite them to see why similar impulses are just as healthy and moral for Americans. We must never forget that our goal is to <em>advance our own interests</em>, and attacking people who we may think are thwarting those interests is not always the best way to advance them.</p>
<p>Jewish or Israeli thinking is not monolithic on these matters. Israel has its own breed of suicidal maniacs who want to give their country away to strangers. We Are Refugees is an organization that passes out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/world/middleeast/crackdown-on-african-immigrants-tugs-at-israels-soul.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=3&amp;emc=eta1">handouts and free legal advice</a> to asylum seekers threatened with deportation from Israel. A few American Jews see the folly of our own immigration policies, and that number will only rise as the consequences of folly multiply.</p>
<p>The Israeli version of Operation Wetback is an unqualifiedly good thing for all racially conscious whites. We should support it, publicize it, and demand that our own governments act in the same manner. In this respect, Israel really can be, as it is written in the Book of Isaiah, &ldquo;a light unto the nations.&rdquo;</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-101921" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It&rsquo;s been said that generals always fight the last war, and that is the problem with many American Jewish intellectuals. As an example, James Howard Kunstler is a brilliant writer on issues of peak oil and converging disasters. He&rsquo;s brilliant even when his predictions are wrong. But when it comes to Europe, he (like Paul Krugman) ignores the waves of terror that muslims bring, the barbarity and oppression of women, the cultural assault. Jewish intellectuals hold their tongues until whites (like the EDL or BNP) rise up to defend themselves, and then the finger-pointing and admonitions begin. The rage of the white working and middle-class in Europe isn&rsquo;t perceived as a justified reaction to an act. It is perceived as the attack itself, and the rise of fascism/ Nazism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, anti-Semites (not just people who believe Jews should be held accountable/held to the same standard, i.e Sam Francis) are committing a couple of grave errors. 1st, they see Jews as a monolithic group. You see it on forums, people talking about the &#8216;Talmudic&#8221; evil of Jon Stewart or Tim Wise. These people are too dense to comprehend that the Jewish secular Left has about nothing in common with the Hasidim/Ethno-National Jews. Tim Wise just put out a new video calling on a boycott of Israel; this isn&rsquo;t a ploy. He is consistent in the masochistic suicide pact he invites both whites and Jews to take part in.</p>
<p>And while I don&rsquo;t think American boys should be losing legs in the sandbox for Israel (nor should AIPAC&rsquo;s money be able to buy our elected officials) I know firsthand from my time in Iraq and living in Germany that Muslims are by and large far more aggressive and violent than any other group you care to mention. If you hate Jews, fine. But if you hate them enough to side with Palestinians or Iran under some false pretext of universalism or peace, you are setting yourself up for a major fall.</p>

&#8220;Likewise, it does no good to complain about American Jews &mdash; and there are many of them &mdash; who support an Israeli ethnostate but insist on multi-culti madness for us. We should congratulate them on the healthy impulses of their Israeli cousins, and invite them to see why similar impulses are just as healthy and moral for Americans. We must never forget that our goal is to advance our own interests, and attacking people who we may think are thwarting those interests is not always the best way to advance them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Complaining about,&#8221; or some might rather say, &#8220;pointing out&#8221; the fact that American Jews do so much to promote multiculturalism is an important part of the argument to be made to all Americans, especially White Americans. In order to drive home the point that White Americans need to organize to promote their own interests, it is necessary that they understand the extent to which other ethnic groups <i>already are</i> organized against our interests: there is no more powerful one of these ethnic congeries than the Jewish lobbies. It is also the case that the same kind of public pressure and &#8220;shaming&#8221; the Jewish lobbies have used so effectively against us could and should be used to motivate, or if you prefer, &#8220;invite&#8221; them. Pointing out the fact that Jews have done so much to contribute to this problem, and continue to do so, should not be construed as an attack; they, as a highly organized, self-identified and overwhelmingly liberal group, are not the victims here: it is the traditional peoples that built this country and created its institutions. Ignoring their disproportionate influence in the media&hellip; won&rsquo;t help. They need to be called out for their behavior. That is the best way to motivate them to change.</p>

<p>Wrong. Whether or not Jews can and should ever be considered white is debatable. I, as a Nordic male, most certainly would welcome a Jew who shared my values to the &#8220;country club,&#8221; even though I am strictly middle class and have never belonged to anything even remotely resembling a country club. Based on what I know however, modern Israel is a state that is propped up to a scandalous extent by American tax dollars and military defense. The Israeli lobby has done serious, palpable harm to the United States and will continue to do so if left to its own devices. Moreover, certain Jewish political and cultural &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; have at times demonstrated an unpardonable hostility to Western civilization and have actively worked to undermine traditionalism in western societies through their advocacy of subversive movements such as communism and radical feminism, and through their advocacy of open-border policies for the U.S. If you&rsquo;re not even willing to admit this fact and want to label anyone who points out the reality a &#8220;Jew hater&#8221; or a &#8220;Jew baiter,&#8221; then we are most certainly not on good terms and never will be. &#8220;[L]et it be known for history that it was the Children of Israel who struck the first blow for the White man.&#8221; I unfortunately cannot properly respond to that without resorting to language that Jared Taylor wouldn&rsquo;t approve of for this website. Suffice it to say that you should cut out the nonsense.</p>

Most people are unaware that there were were secret agreements between the Nazis and the Zionists to &#8220;encourage&#8221; emigration to Palestine.  The &#8220;encouragement&#8221; (approved by Zionists) included forced relocation and marginalization in German society.In addition, WAR was declared on Germany by the jews in 1933.  Look it up in the Jerusalem Post issues of 1933.<br/>
Not all jews are zionists, but all zionists are jews.</p>

&#8220;Perhaps the most extreme case of Zionist exploitation of anti-Semitism to further their cause came during the rise of Adolf Hitler. Historians have documented that Zionists sabotaged efforts to find safe havens for Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany in order to convince the world that Jews could only be safe in a Jewish state.<br/>
When FDR made efforts in 1938, 1943, and again in 1947 to provide havens for Nazi refugees, Zionists opposed these projects because they did not include Palestine.<br/>
Morris Ernst, FDR&rsquo;s international envoy for refugees, wrote in his memoir that when he worked to help find refuge for those fleeing Hitler, &#8216;…active Jewish leaders decried, sneered and then attacked me as if I were a traitor. At one dinner party I was openly accused of furthering this plan of freer immigration [into the U.S.] in order to undermine political Zionism… Zionist friends of mine opposed it.&rsquo;<br/>
Ernst wrote that he found the same fanatical reaction among all the Jewish groups he approached, whose leaders, he found, were &#8216;little concerned about human blood if it is not their own.&rsquo;<br/>
FDR finally gave up, telling Ernst: &#8216;We can&rsquo;t put it over because the dominant vocal Jewish leadership of America won&rsquo;t stand for it.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

The US State Department is infested with dual-nationality Israeli-Americans that look out for Israel&rsquo;s interests ahead of our own.<br/>
I have absolutely no problem with Israel defending itself and looking out for its own interests (which is the right of every country) but I do have a problem with the &#8220;tail&#8221; (Israel) &#8220;wagging the dog&#8221; (USA).<br/>
Our foreign policy has been hijacked by foreign interests (not only Israel) and is in serious need of &#8220;realignment&#8221;.</p>

Son of Abraham should have wrote: &#8220;Israel was &#8220;propped up&#8221; by Palestinian blood shed by Jewish murderers.&#8221;<br/>
 After the UN partition resolution was passed in November 1947 there were at least 33 massacres of Palestinian villages, according to Mazin Qumsiyeh, PhD.  They included Al Abbasiyya (4 May &lsquo;48), Abu Shusha (14 May &lsquo;48), Ayn az Zaytun (2 May &lsquo;48), Balad ash Sheikh (25 April &lsquo;48), Bayt Daras (11 May &lsquo;48), Beer Sheba (21 Oct &lsquo;48), Burayr (12 May &lsquo;48), Al Dawayima (29 Oct &lsquo;48), Deir Yassin (9 April &lsquo;48), Eilaboun (29 Oct &lsquo;48), Haifa (21 April &lsquo;48), Hawsha (15 April &lsquo;48), Husayniyya (21 April &lsquo;48), Ijzim (24 July &lsquo;48), Isdud (28 Oct &lsquo;48), Jish (29 Oct &lsquo;48), Al Kabri (21 May &lsquo;48), Al Khisas (18 Dec &lsquo;48), Khubbayza (12 May &lsquo;48), Lydda (10 July &lsquo;48), Majd al Kurum (29 October &lsquo;48), Mannsurat al Khayt (18 Jan &lsquo;48), Khirbet, Nasir ad Din (12 April &lsquo;48), Qazaza (9 July &lsquo;48), Qisarya (15 Feb &lsquo;48), Sa&rsquo;sa (30 Oct &lsquo;48), Safsaf (29 Oct &lsquo;48), Saliha (30 Oct &lsquo;48), Arab al Samniyya (30 Oct &lsquo;48), Al Tantoura (21 May &lsquo;48), Al Tira (16 July &lsquo;48), Al Wa&rsquo;ra al-Sawda (18 April &lsquo;48), Wadi &lsquo;Ara (27 Feb &lsquo;48)</p>
<p>One of the better-documented massacres occurred in a small, neutral Palestinian village called Deir Yassin in April 1948 . A Swiss Red Cross representative was one of the first to arrive on the scene, where he found 254 dead, including 145 women, 35 of them pregnant. </p>
<p>Witnesses reported that the attackers lined up families – men, women, grandparents and children, even infants – and shot them. </p>
<p>An eyewitness and future colonel in the Israeli military later wrote of the militia members: &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t know how to fight, but as murderers they were pretty good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Red Cross representative who found the bodies at Deir Yassin arrived in time to see some of the killing in action. He wrote in his diary that Zionist militia members were still entering houses with guns and knives when he arrived. He saw one young Jewish woman carrying a blood-covered dagger and saw another stab an old couple in their doorway. The representative wrote that the scene reminded him of S.S. troops he had seen in Athens.</p>
<p>The Deir Yassin attack was perpetrated by two Zionist militias and coordinated with the main Zionist forces, whose elite unit participated in part of the operation. The heads of the two militias, Menachem Begin and Ytzakh Shamir, later became Prime Ministers of Israel.</p>
<p>Begin sent the following message to his troops about their victory at Deir Yassin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accept my congratulations on this splendid act of conquest. Convey my regards to all the commanders and soldiers. We shake your hands. We are all proud of the excellent leadership and the fighting spirit in this great attack. We stand to attention in memory of the slain. We lovingly shake the hands of the wounded. Tell the soldiers: you have made history in Israel with your attack and your conquest. Continue thus until victory. As in Deir Yassin, so everywhere, we will attack and smite the enemy. God, God, Thou has chosen us for conquest.&rdquo;</p>

Taylor writes:<br/>
&ldquo;Likewise,it does no good to complain about American Jews &mdash; and there are many of them &mdash; who<br/>
support an Israeli ethnostate but insist on multi-culti madness for us. We should congratulate them on the healthy impulses of their Israeli cousins, and invite them to see why similar impulses are just as healthy and moral for Americans. We must never forget that our goal is to advance our own interests, and attacking people who we may think are thwarting those interests is not always the best way to advance them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Complaining about,&rdquo; or some might rather say, &ldquo;pointing out&rdquo; the fact that American Jews do<br/>
so much to promote multiculturalism is an important part of the argument to be made to promote solidarity among White Americans. In order to drive home the point that White Americans need to organize to promote their own interests, it is necessary that they understand the extent to which other ethnic groups <i>already are</i> organized against our interests: there is no more powerful one of these ethnic congeries than the Jewish lobbies. It is also the case that the same kind of public pressure and &#8220;shaming&#8221; the Jewish lobbies have used so effectively against us could and should be used to motivate, or if you prefer, &#8220;invite&#8221; them. Pointing out the fact that Jews have done so much to contribute to this problem, and continue to do so, should not be construed as an attack; they, as a highly organized, self-identified and overwhelmingly liberal group, are not the victims here: it is the traditional peoples that built this country and created its institutions. Ignoring their disproportionate influence in the media&hellip; won&rsquo;t help. They need to be called out for their behavior.<br/>
This is, I think, the best way to motivate them to change.<br/>
But this is only my opinion, and I respect yours Mr. Taylor. Criticism is always best applied in moderation where there is so much two differing parties have, and could hope to have, in common.</p>

We need to to give our views an air of middle class respectability and this means distancing ourselves from Anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>We should concentrate on the future of the race realism movement and this means bringing Jews over to our way of thinking. This may not be as impossible as some critics think.  Some conservative Jews are already making contributions to the anti-PC/race realist movement. One has only to check VDARE, DRUDGE, and TAKI&rsquo;S MAGAZINE for their articles and essays. Now for the first time, we can point to the Israeli Government for following the same policies that we advocate. It will become increasingly difficult for our MSM opponents to condemn both us and the Israeli government at the same time. Some will try to dodge the issue, but they will be unable to dodge reality forever.</p>

<p>That *national character* was determined to be no longer relevant to our national needs so now we live in the aftermath of that destruction for better or worse.<br/>
 <br/>
The same people who say it is better now for America are the same people who would say Israel is wrong to take a stand against diversity and multiculturalsim disguised as something else.</p>
<p>Israel was founded by Zionism.  A nationalism.  So it is easier for Israel to say it will maintain its nationalism.  It should be tricky for them to do this since the ultimate result of German Nationalism, it is said, is the evil by which Isreal was permitted to come into existence. White guilt. </p>
<p>It will take a great nationalistic movement for America to become anything other than a World Wide, Global police force for the conflicts of third world countries and a money tree for all the third rate or lesser societies of the world.</p>
<p>But, what kind of nationalism? Lead by what? Made up of what?  How? Maybe it is already happening?<br/>
Maybe like Germany it can happen over night? Maybe if the government doesn&rsquo;t get a grip on black mob violence and blacks targeting whites for the fun of slaughter America will wake up one morning to discover an unpleasant strain of nationalism moving faster than it can be contained.  Based upon what?<br/>
The most basic need of all&hellip;the one Israel and Jews became well aware of: Survival.</p>

As a Jew (Mom&rsquo;s name is Sarah Israel) who lived in Tel Aviv for two years and liked it but not Israeli state policies, I find your racism not any alternative to Black racism.<br/>
When I lived there in israel I found Ethiopian Jews and Palestinian Arabs far preferable to the Ashkenazim males for intelligent conversation and dating.<br/>
I was literally Jew-baited out of Occidental Observer by the Nazi types there even though I expressed serious opposition to Israel and the Shoah Business racket while here your idiot moderators here decided that I wasn&rsquo;t a real Jew !<br/>
Yes, race is serious problem and real issue.<br/>
Neither a phony Semiticphilism like yours or the open anti-Semitism of MacDonald is the answer.<br/>
I know this will be censored here which only proves my point that much more. </p>

For that and other reasons, I am interested in what they have to say about the issues under discussion rather than what they have to say about themselves.</p>
<p>Sometimes people say they are this, that, or the other thing so they can make an &#8220;argument from authority.&#8221; For example, I&rsquo;ve seen people say things like, &#8220;I&rsquo;m Jewish and I can tell you that Jews feel xyz about this issue.&#8221; The problem is that being Jewish does not make one an authority on or give one privileged insight into what all or most Jews feel about anything, and given that we are on the world wide web, if it&rsquo;s true that all or most Jews feel xyz about a given issue, the commenter would do better to simply point us to sites that support that claim. Otherwise, the commenter simply makes an argument from authority of a type that falls into the category of fallacious appeals to authority. And to make matters worse, given that anyone with web anonymity can claim to be pretty much anyone or anything, the mere fact that someone says they are Jewish or Irish or a physician or from New Jersey doesn&rsquo;t carry argumentative weight.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not concerned with whether MS Fleming is a &#8220;real Jew&#8221; or a woman or anything else, nor am I concerned if she seems outlandish. If she makes comments that can be evaluated regardless of who she is, then who she is is irrelevant. And if she were to make comments that put more focus on herself than on the issues, that would make her comments of no interest to me and I would ignore her comments for that reason.</p>

I have simply stated my background because whenever you approach certain issues you are tagged with an unfavorable epithet when you voice a dissenting opinion that differs from the majority views of either the society as a whole or the group you are born into. I had the fascinating experience of a rightist Irish Dad and a fourth generation Communist Mother who is still alive.<br/>
So  along with my brother Peter I was exposed to a wide variance of views from early on. Later I lived in Tel Aviv for two years but our family are long rooted native San Franciscans.<br/>
I never met to claim to speak for all Jews, quite the contrary. Mine is a very minority voice here but it is worth pointing out that not all of us march to the same drummer.<br/>
My experience with real anti-Semitism  at Occidental Observer was very depressing and I thank the people here for trying to keep things on an even keel.</p>

<p>Something that stands out for me about Jared is his impeccable reasoning and the overall clarity of his thought, which I suspect may be partly due to his background in philosophy. It apparently enables him to avoid falling into the kind of vulgar, irrational and hateful ways of thinking about blacks and Jews, etc., that we sometimes see expressed in comments at places like Occidental Observer.</p>

<p>Jared, I&rsquo;m a fan of yours. I particularly like the essay you recently wrote for V-DARE opposing miscegenation. However, the above quote of yours disappointed me greatly. I believe not tackling the Jewish Question very literally ignores the elephant in the room. I don&rsquo;t believe the Jewish Question is one that this country can afford to ignore. I&rsquo;m particularly curious about what your views are concerning the Jewish Question and what you think about the theories propounded by Professor Kevin MacDonald. </p>
<p>I am one of the people who commented on the earlier thread before it was deleted, and basically got hawked at and spit on by a commenter named &#8220;Son of Abraham&#8221; because I soberly dared to point out some very basic and inconvenient facts with regard to the Jewish lobby in this country and Jewish leftist activism historically. My comment was made in reply to this &#8220;Son of Abraham&rsquo;s&#8221; comment that to me was both offensive and delusional. After being dismissive of the stormfront crowd, this guy actually had the chutzpah to claim something like: </p>
<p>       &#8220;The Children of Israel struck the first blow for the white man. Of that there is no denying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he really went on a tantrum after I replied to his post. To me this buttresses my view that the Jewish Question simply cannot be ignored. If we&rsquo;re going to talk about these issues, we have got to keep it real and identify the maleficent and hypocritical Jewish influence in the media that obstructs this country&rsquo;s ability to right its course.</p>

Professor Kevin MacDonald has spent his life tracking the Jewish involvement and blame in creating diversity, while Jared Taylor attempts to transcend the issue and stop the problem. </p>
<p>There can be many things to blame for the creation and sustained existence  of diversity. You can blame capitalism, the lack of caring, land barriers, historical events and religion. Many things have caused diversity, and just calling out the few Jews stupid enough to promote it is not enough to find a model that may create a solution for the problem. </p>
<p>Israel is taking a step in the right direction-they also supported South Africa-and can be, at times, understanding. I can&rsquo;t dispute the many observances where some diversity promoters may have been Jewish, and may have had some ulterior motive, but I can dispute the attitude the &#8220;anti-Semite&#8221; has taken toward them. Most Jewish haters attack the Jewish role because they want to play the victim, the innocent white who had his homeland taken away (boo hoo), while the jews are preserving their own homeland. Many white people WANT to have the same racial preservation as Israel does, but are too weak to say it, because they are too busy playing the role of the victim. Taylor does not like being a victim, he is not the fan of crying, nor does he like criticizing Israel&rsquo;s decision to remove diversity. Jared is proud that he wants to end diversity, and does not need to blame anyone to promote his desire. </p>
<p>The &#8220;antisemite&#8221; is a victim, but only because the jews apparently tricked whites into acting for diversity. The &#8220;antisemite&#8221; actually believes if the Jews are pointed out that the jews created diversity, its fans would go away. The fact is that whites, OUR people, believe to love diversity on their own.  The problem lies within OTHER whites, whether if the Jews &#8220;created&#8221; it or not (What power!). &#8221;Antisemitism&#8221; has become known for its paranoia and weakness among literally everyone-and it is why Jared has discarded it. It does not matter who created diversity, because what matters is the actual problem it carries. </p>

<p>This is not a double standard at all.  Jewish interests are served in both cases.  It makes sense for Israel to remain Jewish and it makes sense for formerly White nations to become multicultural.  Many Jews feel they will be marginalized (or worse) in an ethnically homogenous White country.  On the other hand, they can do quite well as a powerful minority in a country where there is no majority, but rather a collection of various ethnic groups.  Europeans cannot make this point because of their &ldquo;hate&rdquo; laws, but they envy the Americans who can.</p>

It matters little whether Jews respond to this invitation solely out of perennial self-interest, so long as they accept a subordinate position without having any reason to fear persecution.<br/>
  As for MacDonald, there is much sense in his original trilogy (though some specifics can be challenged) but the &#8220;Occidental&#8221; output has become unnecessarily neo-Nazi in various respects, a self-defeating and self-imposed trap, not because there were no &#8220;good things&#8221; in pre-war Germany, nor because &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221; was totally without cause, but because any such arguments need to be presented in a context without crazy Rosenbergism or caricature Streicherism or silly Serranoism or murderous Pierceism.<br/>

I was incessantly Jew-baited by raving bigots who disliked my admiration for Murray Rothbard&rsquo;s ideas and some of Ayn Rand&rsquo;s. I oppose them on open borders and some other libertarian-objectivist idiocies.<br/>
But I&rsquo;m also concerned about the statist aspects of closed borders too.<br/>
The idea should be to reason this out not have the FrankieD&rsquo;s issue their diktats.<br/>
I mentioned my personal characteristics only in response to being viciously smeared<br/>
with standard anti-Semitic &#8216;lookism.&rsquo;<br/>
I was actually too serious a debater and I wasted way too much time responding to imbeciles. MacDonald apologized to me in a private email for what happened there.<br/>
Of course he or anyone else has a right to whatever views they hold and that goes for critics of those views too.<br/>
I was the victim of ad hominem attacks by cowards hiding behind pseudonyms.<br/>
MacDonald&rsquo;s books are certainly controversial and hardly the last word on the subject of the Jewish people. Even paleo-conservatives like Paul Gottfried have taken issue with him.<br/>
In the final analysis anyone who doubts that OO is an anti-Semitic site with plenty of real Nazi types can just go there and look at it. </p>

<p>In other news, George Washington warned us about supporting Israel, but since the Jews are proving themselves good race realists, we&rsquo;ll make an exception of George&rsquo;s warnings:</p>
<p>Farewell Address, Sept. 19, 1796:</p>
<p>So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a<br/>
variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of<br/>
an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and<br/>
infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a<br/>
participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement<br/>
or justification. It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of<br/>
privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the<br/>
concessions; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained, and<br/>
by exciting jealousy, ill-will, and a disposition to retaliate, in the parties<br/>
from whom equal privileges are withheld. And it gives to ambitious, corrupted,<br/>
or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation), facility to<br/>
betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes<br/>
even with popularity; gilding, with the appearances of a virtuous sense of<br/>
obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for<br/>
public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or<br/>
infatuation. </p>
<p>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments are<br/>
particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many<br/>
opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions, to practice the<br/>
arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the public<br/>
councils. Such an attachment of a small or weak towards a great and powerful<br/>
nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter. </p>
<p>Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe<br/>
me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake,<br/>
since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most<br/>
baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be<br/>
impartial; else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoided,<br/>
instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and<br/>
excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on<br/>
one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other.<br/>
Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become<br/>
suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and<br/>
confidence of the people, to surrender their interests. </p>
<p>The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending<br/>
our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as<br/>
possible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled<br/>
with perfect good faith. Here let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interests<br/>
which to us have none; or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in<br/>
frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our<br/>
concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by<br/>
artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary<br/>
combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities. </p>
<p>Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a<br/>
different course. If we remain one people under an efficient government. the<br/>
period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance;<br/>
when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any<br/>
time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under<br/>
the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the<br/>
giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided<br/>
by justice, shall counsel.</p>

While some could take the route of pointing out the Jewish involvement in civil rights and general leftist support, the normal &#8220;anti-Semite&#8221; is looking for clear and easy blame for the wide problem of diversity. Most diversity programs are created by white people, jewish or not, at the local level-and the values of diversity and equality exists in many whites (some religious some not)  as individuals.</p>
<p>The question if the value for diversity was created by the jews does not matter, because the problem of egalitarianism exists everywhere. The idea of complete human equality is celebrated by Christians, the Jews, Liberals and everywhere even if they don&rsquo;t practice or contribute to it.</p>
<p>This article transcends the petty blame one could take towards the creation of diversity, because the article recognizes that diversity is a problem for everyone, not just whites, but also for the Jews. </p>
