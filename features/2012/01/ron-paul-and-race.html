	                	<p>Ron Paul has &mdash; without question &mdash; the most dedicated supporters of any presidential candidate in decades. Perhaps the Buchanan Brigades of 1992 and 1996 showed something like the enthusiasm of Paul backers, but that before everyone was online. Today, the comments section of any article on the 2012 presidential race in even the mainstream media will be deluged with Paul supporters arguing that their man is the only one who will preserve the Constitution, keep us out of foreign wars, and scale back government.</p>
<p>I voted for Ron Paul in 2008 and agree with most of his economic and foreign policy views &mdash; and I am not alone. According to the latest polls, Mr. Paul could win in Iowa tomorrow and is gaining steam nationally.</p>
<p>The race-realist section of the blogosphere is one of the most enthusiastic sources of support for Mr. Paul. For example, a December 16 poll on the website of the Council of Conservative Citizens had Ron Paul as the choice of 80 percent of respondents. His closest rival was Michelle Bachman at 8 percent.</p>
<p>Why is there so much support for Mr. Paul among racially conscious whites? Perhaps some remember the old Ron Paul newsletters of the 1990s. The newsletters came up in the 2008 campaign and have predictably surfaced again, now that Mr. Paul is a serious contender. Some quotes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, it sure burns me to have a national holiday for Martin Luther King. I voted against this outrage time and time again as a Congressman. What an infamy that Ronald Reagan approved it! We can thank him for our annual Hate Whitey Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, I&rsquo;ve urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense. For the animals are coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order was only restored in L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks.&rdquo; (about the Los Angeles riots of 1992)</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are constantly told that it is evil to be afraid of black men; it is hardly irrational.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A photocopy of the hard copy June 15, 1992 Ron Paul newsletter shown on the <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2011/12/20/ron-pauls-foul-old-newsletters-back-in-t"><em>Reason</em> website</a> has the headline &ldquo;A Special Issue on Racial Terrorism,&rdquo; and contains sentences such as:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We now know, if we did not before, that we are under assault from thugs and revolutionaries who hate Euro-American civilization and everything it stands for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand stores and other buildings looted and burned, thousand beaten and otherwise seriously injured, 52 people dead. That was the toll of the Los Angeles riots in which we saw white men pulled from their cars and trucks and shot or brutally beaten. (In every case, the mob was not too enraged to pick the victim&rsquo;s pocket.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Paul&rsquo;s rather weak defense is that he didn&rsquo;t write these words and did not even know they had appeared in the newsletter that bears his name. Of course, the supposedly &ldquo;racist&rdquo; articles only say things that are true, but the taboos against discussing black-on-white violence and black crime and welfare have only gotten stronger in the last two decades, so perhaps he can be excused for running away from those words.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Ron-Paul-Crowd.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-66416" title="Ron-Paul-Crowd" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Ron-Paul-Crowd-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"/></a></p>
<p>Mr. Paul has not said much about race in his presidential runs but what he has said makes him sounds like a leftist. After the December 15 presidential debate in Iowa he was <a href="http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/ron-paul-on-hannity/">interviewed</a> on FOX by Sean Hannity, who asked about the newsletters. Paul replied in a way that sounds as though he thinks blacks have high imprisonment rates because white &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the greatest defender of civil liberties especially when it comes to the inequities in our judicial system, you know, with blacks . . . the imprisonments from the drug wars, the number of blacks to get the death penalty . . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days later, Mr. Paul appeared on <em>The Jay Leno</em> <em>Show</em> to say that Michele Bachmann &ldquo;hates Muslims.&rdquo; He was more charitable to Rick Santorum who merely &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t like&rdquo; Muslims. This implies that Mr. Paul, himself, just can&rsquo;t get enough of Muslims.</p>
<p>In January 2008 he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul">told CNN</a> about his heroes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, Rosa Parks is one of my heroes, Martin Luther King is a hero, because they practiced the libertarian principle of civil disobedience and nonviolence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the past, Mr. Paul even granted VDARE.com an interview, but by 2011 he was promoting rather different views on immigration in his book <em>Liberty Defined</em>. Here are a few excerpts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to hide the fact that resentment toward a Hispanic immigrant is more common than toward a European illegal immigrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One side says use the US Army, round them up ship them home. The other side says give them amnesty . . . . The first choice &mdash; sending twelve to fifteen million illegals home &mdash; isn&rsquo;t going to happen and shouldn&rsquo;t happen. . . if each case is looked at separately, we would find ourselves splitting up families and deporting some who have lived here for decades, if not their entire life, and who have never lived for any length of time in Mexico. This would hardly be a Good Samaritan approach to the problem. It would be incompatible with human rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t punish third parties for not being keen to <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2247/can-cops-really-commandeer-cars">act as law enforcement agents</a> in regard to illegal immigration. Blaming American employers and fining them for hiring an individual, directly or indirectly, with counterfeit identification strikes me as a compulsory servitude not permitted under the constitution. Determining who is legal or not is police and court function, not a responsibility of private business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arizona-type immigration legislation can turn out to be harmful. Being able to stop any American citizen under the vague charge of &#8216;suspicion&rsquo; is dangerous, even more so in the age of secret prisons and a stated position of assassinating American citizens if deemed a &#8216;threat,&rsquo; without charges ever being made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Immigrants] have a work ethic superior to many of our own citizens who have grown dependent on welfare and unemployment benefits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Paul&rsquo;s website claims he is against amnesty but that, &ldquo;As President, Ron Paul will encourage legal immigration by streamlining the entry process without rewarding lawbreakers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such enthusiasm for more legal immigration was evident in <em>Liberty Defined</em>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With free markets and private property, a need for immigrant labor becomes obvious. Make it legal and easy with a generous visitor work program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is almost the doctrinaire libertarian position on immigration.</p>
<p>Like every other Republican candidate, Mr. Paul has not touched affirmative action &mdash; yet in every debate, he rails against burdensome government regulations and intrusion into private lives. Quotas and racial preferences should be exhibit A for big government meddling, but Mr. Paul appears to be afraid of the issue.</p>
<p>A win in the January 3 Iowa primary will surly make the infamous newsletters center stage again. Mr. Paul will have to do better than the &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know&rdquo; defense, and that defense is likely to take the form of hard-left rhetoric on race. Get ready to hold your noses.</p>
<p>For some reason, leftist nonsense on race will probably not lose him many votes &mdash; even among his racially aware white supporters. Once people decide that Mr. Paul is even a little bit on our side on race, they seem ready to forgive him just about anything.</p>
<p>My guess is that Ron Paul probably does have good instincts on race. He would not have hired a complete ideological alien to write those newsletters. However, he certainly does not care enough about race to blow a chance at the top job. If he ever became President he would have had to and dance backwards so frantically on race that he could never suddenly start pushing realistic policies &mdash; even if I am right about his instincts.</p>
<p>Whites looking for an advocate for our people are going to have wait.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58723" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;&hellip;send back our blacks.&#8221; This is the purest example of the racist mentality of dim-witted whites. Captain dim-wit thinks he has the right to determine what happens to black Americans because he is white.  Nine times out of tin, my black ancestors were already here building this nation under the whip and eventually by free will citizenship when his ancestors arrived here.  Black Americans have done more to build this nation that any other ethnic group.  They have paid the price for the &#8220;advancements&#8221; that America offered the white immigrants came here. How did America create white opportunity? They created a false bottom in this ship of state, beneath which no white man could fall; it was done on the backs of and at the expense of black America.  With each successive wave of white immigrants, black workers were dispossessed of their crafts and livelihoods  in order to provide opportunities for new whites.  At one time in America black men were the cooks, chefs, journeymen, gardeners, carpenters, bricklayers, black smiths, metal workers, tanners, so on, and so on. The stock market sold black human beings like cattle, in the name of white advancement</p>
<p>In the midst of slavery, Africans created things like the long handle broom, and many, many other inventions critical to American life. For those who have tried to debunk the history of black American genius, visit this website that lists black inventors in alphabetical order(http://inventors.about.com/od/blackinventors/a/Black_History.htm) that has the list of inventors, inventions, the patent numbers and the date of the patents. Read the lists of hundreds of patent numbers and reassess the thought that black Americans have not greatly contributed to this nation and its success. </p>
<p>There is also the history of American culture and popular culture, that has been built on black music, dance and talent. Black Americans created the Negro spiritual, work songs,  minstrel show music, the popular ballad like &#8220;Carry Me Black To Ol&rsquo; Virginy&#8221;, cakewalk music and the cakewalk dance, ragtime, the black bottom of the &#8220;roaring 20&#8242;s, torch songs, the blues, New Orleans jazz, popular jazz, progressive jazz, the jitterbug dance craze, swing - the big band sound, stride piano, do-wops, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, the Motown sound, the Memphis sound, the Philadelphia sound, funk, psychedelic, gospel music, black popular music(via Stevie Wonder and others), protest music(via Curtis Mayfield, Nina Simone and Gil Scot Heron), and to our chagrin - rap music.</p>
<p>Black America has produced the world&rsquo;s greatest singers: Bessie Smith, Marion Anderson<br/>
Paul Robeson, Billy Eckstine, Cab Calloway, Joe Williams, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald,<br/>
Lena Horne, Louie Armstrong, Sarah Vaughn, Dinah Washington, Nancy Wilson, Ethel Waters, Leslie Uggams, Diahann Carroll, Nat King Cole, Natalie Cole, Sam Cooke,<br/>
Ray Charles, Diana Ross, The Supremes, Smokie Robinson and the Miracles, The Drifters, The Temptations, Eddie Kendricks, Martha and the Vandellas, Ruby and the Romantics, James Brown, Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Sam &amp; Dave, The Coasters, Otis Redding, Carmen McCrae, Della Reese,  Etta James, Peaches &amp; Herb, Lionel Richie, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Stevie Wonder, Earth Wind &amp; Fire, Kathleen Battle, Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson, Betty Carter, Whitney Houston, The Jackson 5, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Miriah Carey, Nina Simone, Roberta Flack, The Mills Brothers, Donna Summers, Alicia Keys, Patti LaBelle, Dionne Warwick, Marilyn McCoo, Gladys Knight, Jessye Norman, Anita Baker, Mary Wells and a long list of others not named here.</p>
<p>Black America has produced some the worlds greatest musicians: Eubie Blake, Noel Sissle, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Fats Waller, Charlie Parker, Myles Davis, the Modern Jazz Quartet,  Herbie Hancock and a long, long list of others.</p>
<p>Black American has produced an incredible long list of sports super stars; many of whom<br/>
have greatly contributed to the long list of gold medals that America has won in the Olympics.</p>
<p>Send black people back to where? We were stripped of our names and places of origin in the name of white advancement. African Americans are America. We have paid the price to be American, despite the centuries of social engineering that has all but destroyed the black family.  We own this place, and no group of Johnny-come-late-lies can assumed the authority to diminish our status or right to be in America, simply because they white.  For the record, Ron Paul is not a racist. The people who are accusing him of being racist, are the racists.</p>

<p>Notice the date, this is not long after the date of the Ames Straw Poll which Bachmann won, which was the very same day the Rickroller announced.  A version of this story first appeared in the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Plus I have two ears, two eyes, and a brain with an above average IQ, an opiate addiction to conventional politics, a long enough life to have observed a lot of these Presidential primary seasons, and an adequate reading of the history of those that occurred before my lifetime and in the realm of modern American political history.</p>
<p>All that is a little more reliable than conspiratorial crackpottery.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re left with one conclusion:  Bachmann is a blocking back for Romney.</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s not doing it at the behest of some &#8220;mysterious&#8221; puppeteer, she&rsquo;s doing it because she wants a cabinet position in the Romney Administration, or for him to twist arms to get the House Republicans to ditch Boehner and make her Speaker.</p>
<p>Heck, when it all comes down to it, Ron Paul might turn into a blocking back for Romney, if he isn&rsquo;t one already, because if he thinks he won&rsquo;t win, he would do anything he can to keep Gingrich from winning, because Paul despises Gingrich on a more personal level than he does Romney.  All goes back to the second half of the 1990s.</p>

<p>1. Ethanol does not cause higher food prices.  We have huge unused ag surplus production capacity.  Even while ethanol corn production has risen dramatically food corn production is up as well as has production of other staple crops so the only mechanism by which ethanol could cause higher food prices is not in fact happening.</p>
<p>2. I also called for making compatibility with METHANOL with an M a standard feature.  Methanol can be made cheaply from natural gas, coal, or any biomass (not just sugar or starch), all of which we have in abundance unlike oil.  Ethanol gets a bum rap and has helped, but methanol is the real key to crushing our enemies overseas.   Methanol is cheaper than gasoline without subsidies and with a vast broad resource base always will be.</p>

<p>One such host, Mark Levin, is on as I write these words.  To show you what kind of a sense of gratitude this schmuck has, he used the first half hour of his show to promise that if Ron Paul ran third party and got at least a million votes (even if those million votes didn&rsquo;t alter the outcome between Obama and Romney), he would do &#8220;everything in my power&#8221; to get Rand Paul out of the Senate.  Now, Levin and Rand Paul had a good relationship before now, and the younger Paul even recommended Levin&rsquo;s previous book.  In spite of what he probably knew was Levin&rsquo;s long career of trashing his father.  No good deed goes unpunished.</p>
<p>If I were Rand Paul, I would hire a lawyer to scour Federal laws for anything that any prosecutor can use to get Mark Levin convicted of a Federal felony and into Federal prison.  Examples:  Financial impropriety relating to his legal foundation, being an &#8220;unregistered lobbyist,&#8221; for whatever concern.</p>

<p>Levin should have read that before running his mouth tonight, this story posted more than five hours before his show started.  He would have saved himself a lot of grief, and he wouldn&rsquo;t have ruined his cordial relationship with a sitting U.S. Senator.  Now I&rsquo;m reading stuff that speculates that Levin just committed some sort of extortion/coercion crime relating to Federal elections.  I&rsquo;m sure some liberal Democrat U.S. Attorney would love to be able to string up any &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk radio host.</p>

<p>5. Opposition to neo-conservatism, intervention and foreign wars. Why is this important? Foreign wars and interventions (Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya among many) generate hundreds of thousands of refugees. Where do these refugees go? The US and other white countries.</p>
<p>That being said, he clearly supports more legal immigration and is seemingly naive about Muslims and Islam.  So your concluding sentence, &#8220;Whites looking for an advocate of our people are going to have to wait&#8221;, is correct.</p>

On social matters Libertarians are far, far left. If Libertarians come to power expect to see the end to any restrictions on immigration. Libertarian philosophy stands on two pillars&hellip; 1) The unrestricted free movement of people on a global basis.  2) The unrestricted free movement of capital on a global basis. What good is it to have sound money (no Fed) if America has become nothing more than a Libertarian engineered polyglot?</p>

And check out scenes of Somalian refugee camps in Kenya - you&rsquo;re telling us that these starving, disease ridden Somalian bantus there won&rsquo;t want to come to Minnesota even after welfare benefits are scaled back? There are still lots and lots of White do gooders in Minnesota that will want to house, clothe and feed the Somalians.</p>

Because he leans libertarian on most issues, a Ron Paul presidency would be beneficial to whites.  He can think whatever he wants about race, but as long as he promotes an unobtrusive government with an emphasis on a merit based society, he will be responsible for moving the country in the right direction.</p>
<p>I also agree with Paul on most of his other positions, particularly his fight against the neocons and our wasteful warfare state that irreparably harms all our citizens, black and white. </p>
<p>I would love to see a true far right candidate run, but for now I am more than happy to vote for Ron Paul.</p>

Because OPEC controls 78% of world oil supply while we have less than 2%, OPEC can set production levels to control the supply available to the world market, and thus set prices wherever it likes.  Ultimately OPEC deliberately under-produces to create artificial scarcity and artificially high prices in a giant brutally regressive tax on the entire rest of the world, including us.  The Saudis&rsquo; total cost per barrel is about $1.50 yet oil was $10 a barrel in 1999 and over $140 a barrel in 2008, a &#8220;tax&#8221; increase of over $650 billion (since we import 5 billion a year), coming to over $8,000 per family of 4 when average income is $35K after taxes.  And yet you complain about Israel??  Focus on the conspiracy of Mideastern socialist tyrants that actually exists in the real physical world - OPEC.  I&rsquo;d rather send my fuel dollars to all American corn farmers in the Midwest.</p>

<p><b>&#8216;Federal bureaucrats and judges cannot read minds to see if actions are<br/>
motivated by racism. Therefore, the only way the federal government<br/>
could ensure an employer was not violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964<br/>
was to ensure that the racial composition of a business&rsquo;s workforce<br/>
matched the racial composition of a bureaucrat or judge&rsquo;s defined body<br/>
of potential employees. Thus, bureaucrats began forcing employers to<br/>
hire by racial quota. Racial quotas have not contributed to racial<br/>
harmony or advanced the goal of a color-blind society. Instead, these<br/>
quotas encouraged racial balkanization, and fostered racial strife.&rsquo;</b></p>

 <br/>
This is a blaring indictment against Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich or any other candidate in the field who support endless wars and federal government tyranny. This exposes the lackluster support for the Neocons and their agenda. How can they claim their winning with so little visible support? The short answer, they can&rsquo;t.<br/>

RON PAUL is the only candidate that can beat Obama in 2012.</p>

<p>I do not pretend to know the dynamics of the American system or the political atmosphere in America, but Ron Paul sounds like a real challenge to the two party state control over major issues, just like we have in Britain with the &#8220;main three&#8221; parties. </p>
<p>As the article states, and as others have commented on, he is not really a &#8216;racial themed&rsquo; candidate - he is just a Libertarian candidate who is prepared to challenge the more general prevailing orthodoxies from the more &#8216;typical&rsquo; candidates/puppets. </p>
<p>Regarding &#8216;race blind&rsquo; libertarianist viewpoints, I do wonder how some of these forms of libertarian expect to keep their traditional western civilisation ideals and principles going in the future when their core supporters and upholders (who I believe are to be more likely to be white) are going to be dwindling into a demographic minority.  </p>
<p>I also wonder if this campaign would be quite as tight if it was being held somewhere which is not around 90% white. I have no evidence to substantiate these points, but my impression is that non-whites are not as naturally inclined to libertarian ideals and, for example, prefer a welfare state and &#8216;protection&rsquo; such as &#8216;hate speech&rsquo; laws.</p>

They feel there is no difference in importing a Mexican made shirt and a Mexican worker. Paul is a little better - but not much. In fact,he is regressing from some of his better positions of four years ago. I would look elsewhere for a candidate who will stop the third world immigration invasion.

<p>I for one am tired of baseless support for Ron Paul among race realists. While a long time ago Ron Paul or his staff may have expressed sensible views on race, his policies on economics, trade, drug legalization and his enthusiasm for legal immigration and some form of amnesty make him entirely unacceptable. He&rsquo;s no Patrick Buchanan. Let&rsquo;s face it, there are no candidates in either party who support race realism. The elections are rigged and voting is a waste of time in my opinion. It will not accomplish anything. I&rsquo;m not worried about Ron Paul because I know he can&rsquo;t win however.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58705" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Ron Paul is not and never was any sort of white nationalist, despite the mass media&rsquo;s best attempt at portraying him that way.   But be realistic   &mdash;   nobody who is explicitly pro-white to the degree that Eric Holder is pro-black has a chance of being elected dog catcher in the United States as it is now.  Although Ron Paul is against illegal immigration his libertarian instincts make him unwilling to enforce the law in any effective way.  (If you don&rsquo;t want families broken up then end birth right citizenship   &mdash;   then the kids can be deported too.)  Ron Paul is against affirmative action but given the heat he&rsquo;s taking on the old newsletter articles (which Paul did not write) and his opposition to the Civil Rights Act (because of the inteference it imposes on private businesses) he has no doubt decided that he doesn&rsquo;t need to give more ammunition to Rachel Maddow.</p>
<p>Given that a man like Jared Taylor or Richard Spencer hasn&rsquo;t got a snowball&rsquo;s chance in hell of being elected to national office, I&rsquo;ll settle for a guy who will get us out of stupid wars, preserve the Bill of Rights, and seriously try to balance the budget   &mdash;   Ron Paul.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58732" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I find it disturbing for racially conscious whites to be uncritically gushing over Ron Paul. This guy received an F on immigration issues from the premier ant-immigration group Numbers USA. The only candidate rated lower was Obama. Paul doesn&rsquo;t even have the guts or consistency to criticize affirmative action (there aren&rsquo;t many more blatant examples of big government social engineering and meddling.) Paul is opposed to the tough Arizona law, e-verify, and the border fence. What a poor record.</p>
<p>Most libertarians (there is no doubt that Paul is a staunch libertarian) are bad on race. They consider white racial consciousness as unacceptable &#8220;collectivism.&#8221; Paul lists Rosa Parks and MLK as two of his heroes. Mainstream libertarians seem to love the notion of open borders and importing millions of cheap labor, illegal aliens to this country.</p>
<p>Paul is not the answer to our all important immigration problem.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58169" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You people refuse to see or hear this but the truth is the breakdown of the black family, the violence perpetrated by the fatherless was engineered. Black unemployment is between 20-25%. Democrats, catholics, and jews  have fought to keep the borders open.  30-40 million Mexicans have disenfranchised Black America. Media and music promotes sexual perversion and debauchery to all American children. Black men, women and teens cannot get jobs, because the democrats, catholics and jews are now courting the endless supply of cheap labor whom they can legalize and turn into to liberal voters. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the last century it was the Irish, Jews, and Italians who were perpetrating most of the urban crime, especially in New York, Boston, and Chicago.  Black people lived in terror.  Thousands of lynchings of black men occurred between the beginning of slavery and the 1960&#8242;s, and was accepted as a white cultural norm, if not a right.  Google images of lynchings, and see whole towns participating with glee in the tarring and feathering, the castration and burning and lynching of black men while their children stand by and watch their parents commit murder. Black women and children were raped, and the police would not protect black people. The police themselves even participated in the rape and butchering of black people, including children, especially black boys.  During these times 75% of the crimes black American experienced was at the hands of whites. The police also helped to deliver the cultural message that black life was expendable. Research how many innocent black boys have been executed  right in front of their parent&rsquo;s eyes.  Black parents were forced to allow their daughters to be routinely be raped by all levels of white men, or face the penalty of their own death, or the death of their daughters. </p>
<p>Whites refuse to admit that their fear of black violence is of their own making. Now they are using their latest manuevers in social engineering<br/>
with Mexican illegal aliens to accelerate the violence carried out by the children of the welfare system that has been used to remove black men from jobs and their families. When your country favors illegal foreigners over it&rsquo;s legal citizens. When they pass laws to protect illegals at the expense of outraged citizens, why are you surprised at the escalating violence?</p>
<p>It has become a racist habit of younger whites to slander black people on the internet. Whites and black people can commit the same kinds of crimes, yet whites will ignore the race of white perpetrators, but immediately will attribute black violence to race.  Whites can shoot up whole families, towns and campuses.  White men can abduct and murder<br/>
children and babies, yet whites like the ones on this thread attribute this criminal behavior to individuals, but acts by black criminals are attributed to the whole race.  You people are idiots, you take for granted that the majority of black Americans condone black criminals. Here&rsquo;s  a thought for you dim-wits, 98% of the crimes committed by black criminals are perpetrated up black people.  We want them dead more than you do.  We have gone from living in fear of white terrorism, to fearing the mindless spirit of murder that now resides among underclass<br/>
black kids. They are waging a murderous campaign against black middle class boys. The fatherless are jealously killing the boys with protective parents.  All thanks to the invention of the political welfare plantation, foisted on the black community by lawless  liberal politicians.</p>

Blacks are 12% of the population yet commit over 50% of violent crime. Blacks have destroyed great cities like Detroit, Birmingham and Philadelphia.Dear BGF,</p>
<p>You forgot Newark, Baltimore, Atlanta, Miami, Trenton remember (&#8220;Trenton Makes, The World Takes&#8221;. It&rsquo; s still on the Bridge but meaningless), Buffalo, Memphis, Camden (believe it or not), Gary, New Orleans, St. Petersburg (Fl), San Francisco ( with no lack of help from the city fathers), St. Louis,  Kansas City, LA, Long Beach, Atlantic City etc. ad infinitum et ad nauseum. Their disproportionately large criminal element whose crimina have been passed down from one generation to the next, has been  pillaging our cities and murdering and raping their law abiding citizens for the last 100 years with increased intensity following the birth of the &#8220;Great Society&#8221; of Lyndon (Bane of our existence) Johnson.</p>
