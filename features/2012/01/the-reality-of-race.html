<p>Jun 08, 2011<br/>
Stephen Jay Gould mismeasured skulls in racial records dispute<br/>
Dan Vergano, USA TODAY [excerpts]<br/>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/75hd5qv" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/75hd5qv</a></p>
<p>The late scientific icon, Stephen Jay Gould, botched and perhaps faked his critique of a racist 19th-Century scientist&rsquo;s skull collection, suggests a second look at his efforts. In a 1978 Science paper, Gould (1941 - 2002), reported that the Samuel George Morton (1799-1851), &#8220;a prominent Philadelphia physician,&#8221; had mis-measured the cranial capacities of his 1,000-skull &#8220;American Golgotha&#8221; collection gathered from around the world, to suit his racist beliefs. The finding led to one of Gould&rsquo;s best-known books, The Mismeasure of Man, a critique of scientific racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morton is now viewed as a canonical example of scientific misconduct. But did Morton really fudge his data?,&#8221; asks a PLoS Biology study led by anthropologist Jason Lewis of Stanford University. &#8220;Are studies of human variation inevitably biased, as per Gould, or are objective accounts attainable, as Morton attempted?&#8221;</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>Morton neither manipulated his skull samples, unfairly selected which data to report, skewed results by gender, or ignored his mistakes to favor racist interpretations of his skulls, the PLoS Biology study authors conclude   &mdash;   all charges made by Gould against the long-dead physician.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the researchers found Gould made some mistakes in his re-analysis of Morton. &#8220;Our analysis of Gould&rsquo;s claims reveals that most of Gould&rsquo;s criticisms are poorly supported or falsified,&#8221; they conclude: &#8220;Samuel George Morton, in the hands of Stephen Jay Gould, has served for 30 years as a textbook example of scientific misconduct. The Morton case was used by Gould as the main support for his contention that &#8216;unconscious or dimly perceived finagling is probably endemic in science, since scientists are human beings rooted in cultural contexts, not automatons directed toward external truth&rsquo;. This view has since achieved substantial popularity in &#8216;science studies&rsquo;. But our results falsify Gould&rsquo;s hypothesis that Morton manipulated his data to conform with his a priori views. The data on cranial capacity gathered by Morton are generally reliable, and he reported them fully. Overall, we find that Morton&rsquo;s initial reputation as the objectivist of his era was well-deserved.&#8221;our results falsify Gould&rsquo;s hypothesis that Morton manipulated his data to conform with his a priori views. The data on cranial capacity gathered by Morton are generally reliable, and he reported them fully. Overall, we find that Morton&rsquo;s initial reputation as the objectivist of his era was well-deserved.&#8221;</p>

Many here will love watching this video as it is very informative and offers new insight; however it will only be watched by the core believers. Basically it is preaching to the choir.  I am saying this to be constructive and not in any way as a form of criticism; the videos need to be controversial and have spin. They cannot be tame or overly intellectual, and they need to tap into emotion in some way in order to spread the message.</p>
<p>If Amren wants to advertise and gain membership then hit on HOT topics and exploit them via youtube (while not violating copyright laws, of course). It is all about SPIN. Choose the weekly lightening rod racial story, create a video making comments about that story (and make sure it involves emotion of some sort, humor, inciting anger, love for ones own, etc&hellip;.) then post the video on youtube and make SURE the title/key words match so when people search for that story the video appears.</p>
<p>The guy that writes the tag lines for the current Amren stories is witty, involve him in the script writing.</p>

<p>A series of these kinds of videos are long overdue in our movement, because we still get the same tired clichés rolled at us time and time again. I only heard the &#8216;more variations between our population than between races&rsquo; argument a few weeks ago, as it happens. </p>
<p>I knew it was a load of nonsense and I had been through it before with somebody else about four years ago, but this time I could not remember all the required lines of thought (I think I am getting too forgetful and too muddled in my recollection to put forward a good challenge) - so videos like this one are excellent back up which we can either reference/use ourselves or, of course, point people towards directly if the discussion is taking place on-line. </p>
<p>The issue of race is probably the most difficult one for fence-sitters and opposition people to be persuaded on, so I am glad to see another video on the subject (the last one which described our predicament was also valuable) and the tease of a follow up for a series. </p>
<p>Hopefully, the series will roll on for quite some time and gradually de-construct all the usual issues and topics which get flung at us. </p>
<p>It is the same here in Britain, where we must get the same ten or so tracks of thought waged against us. Ie, Race is not important/does not really exist, &#8220;who cares?&#8221;, slavery, colonialism, British Empire, we white folk stealing their wealth, being responsible for their lack of progress, &#8216;we went there, so they are all here&rsquo;, how we &#8216;need&rsquo; them to come to pay for our care or to work in hospitals or perceived lowly jobs, etc. It is always the same handful of things just being put in different combinations. </p>
<p>We generally used to scuttle away from these charges in Britain, but we are gradually getting more able to counter them - and I think that although Jared is primarily orientated around America and American statistics and American themes, references, culture and history, much of it does still &#8220;cross over the pond&#8221; to parts of Europe. Race is one example which is universal in truth.</p>
