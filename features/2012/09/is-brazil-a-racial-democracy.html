<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Edward E. Telles, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691118663/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0691118663&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20"><em>Race in Another America: The Significance of Skin Color in Brazil</em></a>, Princeton University Press, 2005, 336 pp., $27.95.</strong></p>
<p>Edward Telles, a professor of sociology at Princeton, has written a useful book that blows the whistle on Brazil&rsquo;s &ldquo;racial democracy&rdquo; and the claim that the country has somehow solved problems that baffle the rest of us. Prof. Telles calls for greater honesty in describing the race question, but his proposed solution &mdash; quotas &mdash; would only light the fuse for greater conflict. His basic position is that genetic explanations for race differences have been refuted and that inequality is a product of culture. His descriptions of Brazilian society thoroughly debunk the image of harmony.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691118663/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0691118663&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101150" title="RaceInAnotherAmerica" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RaceInAnotherAmerica.gif" alt="" width="300" height="456"/></a></p>
<p>The myth is that miscegenation solved the Brazilian race problem. Mixing between Portuguese migrants &mdash; almost all of whom were men &mdash; and blacks produced a roughly half black-and-mulatto and half white population that supposedly gets along without friction. The mulatto is the national symbol.</p>
<p>Brazilian history is, indeed, very different from US history. The Portuguese came without women and brought about seven times as many black slaves as were imported to the United States.  Slavery was not ended until 1888.</p>
<p>Because there were so many blacks in Brazil, in the 1880s the government actively recruited white immigrants. This led to a literal &ldquo;whitening&rdquo; of the country, and whites argued that sustained miscegenation would improve the black racial stock.  This notion of improvement-through-whitening remained in force for at least a century and is still commonly believed, much to Prof. Telles&rsquo;s dismay.</p>
<p>Miscegenation theory gave the Brazilian eugenics movement a unique character. At the First Brazilian Eugenics Conference, held in 1929, there was vigorous debate about whether race mixing with blacks led to degeneracy. Franz Boas himself showed up and claimed that miscegenation was normal and healthy, and that eugenics had nothing to do with race. A Brazilian eugenicist, Fernando Magalhaes agreed, claiming, &ldquo;We are all Mestizos!&rdquo; The Brazilian eugenics conference went on to endorse miscegenation, thus distinguishing itself from eugenics elsewhere in the world. The myth of racial democracy, with the mulatto as its national symbol, would persist for another 60 to 70 years.</p>
<div id="attachment_101149" style="width: 367px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Boaz.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-101149" title="Boaz" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Boaz.jpg" alt="" width="357" height="456"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Franz Boaz took an interest in Brazilian &#8220;eugenics.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>In the 1930s, popular social commentator Gilberto Freyre continued to celebrate miscegenation. Freyre and his colleagues believed racial inequality was an artifact of slavery and culture, and would disappear with time. In the 1950s this theory was expanded by the Marxist sociologist Florestan Fernandez, who argued that labor market competition would end racial inequality because careers would reflect merit. Whites would resist equality, but capitalism would create opportunities for advancement, and whites would have to accept mulattos and blacks.</p>
<p>From 1940 to 2000, European immigration decreased, and the percentage of whites fell from 64 percent to 54 percent. Mulattos increased from 21 percent to 43 percent, and blacks declined from 15 to 5 percent. Clearly there was miscegenation by whites, but mostly by the bottom fifth of the socio-economic scale, and mostly with mulattos rather than blacks.</p>
<p>With more whites of both sexes available for marriage, whites in the middle-class and higher turned their backs on miscegenation, leading to a de facto color line. This led, in Prof. Telles&rsquo;s words, to &ldquo;marginalization of blacks and browns,&rdquo; and made it harder to maintain the myth of racial democracy. The myth staggered on into the mid-1990s, but came under increasing attack from black activists and scholars like Prof. Telles. He spends 270 pages telling us that there is terrible inequality in Brazil, which must be ended through strict employment quotas, and penalties for discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>Race in Brazil today</strong></p>
<p>The south of Brazil is majority white, and the north is predominantly black and mulatto.  In most areas there is residential self-segregation; even the <em>favelas</em>, or slums, are segregated. Prof. Telles notes that &ldquo;color differences between . . . two poor neighborhoods show that class alone may not explain spatial segregation,&rdquo; but he does not speculate as why the races would separate. Nor does he explain why there is self-segregation between blacks and mulattos.</p>
<div id="attachment_101151" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Favela.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-101151 " title="Favela" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Favela.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="398"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rocinha: the largest <em>favela</em> in Rio de Janeiro.</p></div>
<p>Although there was a &ldquo;black soul&rdquo; movement in Brazil beginning in the late 1970s, the country had nothing like the civil-rights disturbances that wracked the United States. In 1964, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, which banned discrimination in employment and public accommodation, but Brazil did not get equivalent laws until 24 years later. In 1988 &mdash; 100 years after emancipation &mdash; a new constitution proclaimed an era of racial equality by making &ldquo;the practice of racism . . . subject to imprisonment,&rdquo; and laid the groundwork for hundreds of local anti-discrimination laws.</p>
<p>These laws, however, are rarely enforced; Prof. Telles cites only three cases in 10 years. This appears to be the Brazilian way: lots of laws and much talk, but little or no enforcement.</p>
<p>Prof. Telles draws a distinction between vertical and horizontal inequality. The vertical has to do with jobs, money, status, education, etc., while the horizontal is socializing and even marrying across racial lines. Prof. Telles tells us that despite more horizontal equality than in the United States, vertical inequality remains severe.</p>
<p>Prof. Telles says that according to US Department of Labor statistics, in 1960, an American white man was three times more likely to have a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; job than a black man but that by 1996, the differential had dropped to 1.6. For women, the white advantage declined from 2.8 to 1.4.  American racism is therefore held under tenuous control through race preferences and quotas.</p>
<p>In Brazil, Prof. Telles tells us, the gap between whites and blacks-and-mulattos has increased. He says this is due to a racial hierarchy devised and enforced by whites for their own benefit: &ldquo;Race relations depend on how persons are categorized, a process in which more powerful persons ascribe and impose categories on others.&rdquo; Many non-whites have internalized this hierarchy and use color to navigate Brazil&rsquo;s racial labyrinth.  The result, says Prof. Telles, is a &ldquo;discriminatory glass ceiling&rdquo; that &ldquo;prevents them from entering the middle class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, if Brazilians have succeeded in establishing a fair measure of &ldquo;horizontal equality,&rdquo; why wouldn&rsquo;t whites hire non-whites they know and like?  According to Richard Lynn, the average IQ in Brazil is 87. If this figure is accurate, and whites are 53 percent of the population, we can calculate the average non-white IQ. If the white average is 100, the non-white average is 72. If the white average is 95, the non-white average is still no more than 78. As they do in the United States, racial gaps in achievement no doubt reflect racial gaps in ability.</p>
<p>As for miscegenation, it now appears to be more myth than reality. Prof. Telles describes a system of exchange in which status, money, and skin color are all carefully evaluated in the marriage market, with very little left of the romance of the racial-rainbow utopia.  Everyone wants to marry light-skinned women, and Prof. Telles depicts painful scenes of the blackest of women who are left on the shelf.</p>
<div id="attachment_101153" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/BrazilianWomen.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-101153" title="BrazilianWomen" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/BrazilianWomen.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="318"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Light-skinned Brazilians are favored on the marriage market.</p></div>
<p>There appears to be as much racial hypocrisy in Brazil as in the United States, with whites telling pollsters they have integrationist beliefs, but acting differently. The issue of implicit versus explicit racism is the same in both countries.</p>
<p>Despite the myth of the mulatto nation, the Brazilian reality is that blacks are at the bottom with whites at the top. Prof. Telles says the increasing distance between the races is most apparent in a &ldquo;growing gap in college attainment.&rdquo;  Brazil is supposed to be booming, but its per capita GNP of about $12,000 is hardly shared equally. As mulattos and blacks fall further behind, there is only the barest welfare system for them.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;crime&rdquo; does not even appear in Prof. Telles&rsquo;s index, but it is a serious problem in Brazil. The homicide rate, at 26 per 100,000, is more than five times the US rate of 4.7. Gang violence, drug cartel killings, and street crime are common, especially during Carnival. Police have long been accused of simply shooting down black and mulatto street urchins.</p>
<p>Prof. Telles&rsquo;s solution for these problems is clear: a kind of Great Leap Forward through quotas and systematic racial preferences.  There have been attempts at racial quotas in Brazil, especially in universities, which can accommodate only a few who would like to attend. This appears to be more a measure forced on the country by elites rather than a response to strong demand from non-whites, but anything like the ruthless quotas Prof. Telles recommends would surely send the country into convulsion.</p>
<p>Like many observers of Brazil, Prof. Telles reports less racial rancor than in the United States, despite yawning economic gaps. Could it be that this is because Brazilians grasp the reality of racial differences? Prof. Telles complains that &ldquo;while nineteenth century scientific theories of white supremacy have since become discredited, such ideas remain deeply embedded in social thinking in Brazil.&rdquo; If they are &ldquo;deeply embedded,&rdquo; it could mean people quietly accept race differences in ability and unequal outcomes. The relative social peace that is built on acceptance of differences would be destroyed by policies that assume an equality that most people know if false.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the concept of an idealized &ldquo;racial democracy&rdquo; is dead and gone. Brazil has a race problem, just like every other multi-racial country. Its ways of dealing with it have sometimes differed from those in the United States, but Brazil&rsquo;s history confirms that there is no way to avoid the tensions that arise when races of significantly different levels of ability try to live together.</p>

<p>I am reminded of a snippet of conversation from a documentary on race presented by Norwegian journalist Harald Eia, featured on Amren.com early this summer:</p>
<p>HARALD EIA (to viewers): Race science has been used to repress populations. But could it be that they [race scientists] were on to something? That race actually exists?</p>
<p>KNUT OLAV AAMAAS [Norwegian philosopher and newspaper editor]: I feel that science has proved that human races don&rsquo;t exist. I feel that there are much more than 90 percent of all the genes in human body that are common for all people. What separates us is a very small percentage.</p>
<p>EIA [to viewers]: Over 90 percent. Are we really that similar? Dag Undlien<br/>
is a professor in medical genetics in Ullevaal Hospital. He has recent figures.<br/>
What is the right number?</p>
<p>UNDLIEN: 99.5 percent is what we talk about now. That&rsquo;s the best estimate<br/>
of how similar you and I are. </p>
<p>EIA [to viewers]: So there is only a half a percent that differs in us<br/>
humans. But how similar are we to our closest relative, the chimpanzee?</p>
<p>UNDLIEN: Then we&rsquo;re down to 98.5 percent roughly. That&rsquo;s the last I<br/>
saw.</p>
<p>EIA [to viewers]: So only 1.5 percent differs from this little lady [camera<br/>
show small chimp] to us humans. [to Undlien]. Dog breeds are different. How<br/>
dissimilar are they genetically?</p>
<p>UNDLIEN: There is no greater difference in dogs from different breeds than<br/>
in humans.</p>
<p>EIA [to viewers, while camera shows a split screen shot of a poodle and a<br/>
German shepherd]: </p>
<p>These two dogs are more similar genetically than these two humans<br/>
[camera shows a split screen of the head of a bushman and of Eia]. So that half<br/>
a percentage point may be more meaningful than we think.</p>
<p>UNDLIEN: What&rsquo;s striking is that we are very similar. But the small<br/>
percentage that differs in us is very interesting. Because it&rsquo;s there our<br/>
differences originate. That gives us our different traits.</p>
<p>COMMENT: That &#8220;small percentage&#8221; has required endless and elaborate rationalizations and deceptions on the part of American and European academics, politicians and judges.   And their rationalizations, fraud and/or outright incompetence has produced endless misery and vexation for white  populations targeted for their &#8220;remedies&#8221;.</p>

<p>No.  Relations between higher men and the uncivilized depend upon the latter&rsquo;s ability to adapt to civilized ways.   But since it is unrealistic to expect the lower to ever assimilate into the higher, it really depends upon maintaining a clear demarcation between disparate groups, with minimal &#8220;crossing over.&#8221;  This was the real purpose of Jim Crow.</p>

True pardos-coloreds- are visibly not White. US examples would be someone like Paula Patton (see pic) or Halle Berry.<br/>
Blacks are Denzel etc. Pitch Blacks are Wesley Snipes or Yaphet Kotto. <br/>

<p>You are correct, and the Dominicans know why there half of the island is better.  The Dominican Republic has very strict immigration laws against Haitians for that reason.  Of course, the Haitians scream that this is racism.  As is expected, it is not possible for that demographic to be introspective and honest as to why they are not wanted in most lands.  Even those lands where the people are only slightly lighter like in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haitians living and working as illegal immigrants in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola, have grouped together recently to protest their treatment. The Dominican Republic denies citizenship to Haitians who migrate there to work, and also denies citizenship to Haitian children born in the country.&#8221;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-126096" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>One more degrading thing from too much black presence: oversexualization with all its accompanying debilitations &amp; social upheavals. Great civilizations knew the power of sex; they also knew its creative and destructive potentials and were wary about it, all the time.</p>
<p>I Ching, ancient Chinese book of changes (actually, wisdom), says: &#8220;He who nourishes higher parts of his nature is a superior man; he who<br/>
nourishes lower parts of his nature is an inferior man&#8221; (or woman).<br/>
Anatomically, traditional psychologies, East and West, had considered<br/>
higher parts those above solar plexus- heart, thymos (in Plato) will and mind;<br/>
lower are stomach (gluttony) and sex. Being a slave to sex, especially<br/>
sex fetishes; this is degrading. We in the West, from Ovid via St. Augustine to Freud, variously accentuating segments of sexuality &amp; moving from moral psychology to that of conflicting drives embedded - but not reducible to -in our biological substructure, have dismantled many of unnecessary baggage connected with this area of human life.</p>
<p>But- the trap is: for developed humans sex is an area people can find pleasure in, passion and much more. Just- there is much, much more in life than that. No developed man or woman can find life&rsquo;s &#8220;fulfillment&#8221; in sex. If they can, they&rsquo;re animalistic dumbsters. And that&rsquo;s where Blacks enter the scene: they are, most of them, unable to rise above base level of being. Their sexuality is, in our eyes, divorced from morality. In fact- what&rsquo;s their sexual morality ?</p>
<p>The Portuguese are not sex obsessed nation. Nor were Americans until 1950s. High rates of promiscuity, almost sick obsession with sexual matters, obscene references wherever you turn- this is Black influence in mixed-races societies cultures. I suspect that much quoted Albert Schweitzer&rsquo;s opinion on Africans has as much to do with their inability to be anything more than copulation-obsessed species (and not much more) as it was a reflection on IQ or any other aspect of their behavior.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-126300" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The American culture was put through a process of &#8220;africanization&#8221; that actually started back in the 1920s with the jazz movement. Each generation of white people pushed the line farther and farther. I think it has gone as far as it will go. At some point about 20 years ago, blacks stopped trying to conform to white norms of behavior and instead started celebrating their base nature. In other words, they decided to let it all hang lose and &#8220;get jiggy wit it&#8221;. What they are producing today, in the form of music and entertainment is now clashing with the inner nature of the young white people. Sure, there are some wiggas with their pants down low, but most young white people instinctively recoil from what they see blacks doing now.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-126350" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>These things are fundamentally different:</p>
<p>* no affirmative action in Brazil re education &amp; employment, especially at government jobs<br/>
* no constant push from government to promote blacks &amp; browns to all prominent positions, from science and academia to economy &amp; politics<br/>
* no- at least in theory- massive media lying about Blacks&rsquo; achievements in all human fields<br/>
* no separate higher education institutions for Blacks (except politically motivated university in past few years). No 20+ historically Black colleges &amp; universities from 19th century<br/>
* Brazilian lowbrow culture (and a part of highbrow) is Africanized, unlike that in the US. American popular dances &amp; music, for Whites, have been, historically, rooted in European tradition (Switzerland, Ireland, England,..). There is a distinct White American culture- musical, literary &amp; philosophical that has nothing to do with Blacks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether there are available interracial crime statistics; also, I doubt that Black Brazilians are much into nutty subculture like many Blacks in the US (Egypt, UFOs from pyramids etc.)</p>
<p>But, I&rsquo;m convinced that Sailer was telling the truth: <a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2012/02/are-brazilians-latinos.html" rel="nofollow">http://isteve.blogspot.com/2012/02/are-brazilians-latinos.html</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Brazil&rsquo;s government has enacted one of the Western Hemisphere&rsquo;s most sweeping affirmative action laws, requiring public universities to reserve half of their admission spots for the largely poor students in the nation&rsquo;s public schools and vastly increase the number of university students of African descent across the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>My favorite is when I go to the Smithsonian museums.  When you go in the elevators, instead of hitting the button yourself, there is a worker sitting in the elevator (always black) who pushes the button for you.  That&rsquo;s all they do.  Somebody told me they make $60K a year with benefits.  It really wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me with how DC is run.</p>
