	                	<p><em>On November 30,  the </em>New York Times<em> published an op-ed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/opinion/the-real-thomas-jefferson.html?_r=1&amp;">piece </a>by a law professor named Paul Finkelman, who calls Thomas Jefferson &#8220;a creepy, brutal hypocrite&#8221; because he owned slaves. Prof. Finkelman also takes it for granted that Jefferson had children with his slave Sally Hemings. Jared Taylor has written a response to Prof. Finkelman <a href="http://takimag.com/article/miscegenation_at_monticello_jared_taylor#axzz2ENsEb5oi">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>What follows is a review of an unjustly neglected book that strongly defends the third President against the charge that he slept with his slave.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>William G. Hyland, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312561008/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312561008&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20">In Defense of Thomas Jefferson: The Sally Hemings Sex Scandal</a>, Thomas Dunne Books, 2009, 292 pp., $26.95.</strong></p>
<p>Nearly every American &ldquo;knows&rdquo; that Thomas Jefferson had several children with his slave, Sally Hemings. Nearly everyone &ldquo;knows&rdquo; that this has been confirmed by DNA evidence. Lefties even claim that Jefferson raped his slave. In fact, no one &ldquo;knows&rdquo; any of this; the evidence for a Hemings affair is unconvincing. If it were not for the ferocious joy the Left takes in believing the worst of the Founding Fathers, the allegations of an affair at Monticello would be a historical footnote.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312561008/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312561008&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102301" title="JeffersonCover" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/JeffersonCover.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="491"/></a></p>
<p>William Hyland, a practicing lawyer and board member of the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, has written an important book that summarizes the evidence on both sides and argues convincingly that Jefferson was not the father of Sally&rsquo;s children and probably never slept with her. His book is a welcome antidote to the mountains of nonsense that paint the third president as a lecherous old miscegenator.</p>
<p><strong>The muckraker</strong></p>
<p>It was a contemporary of Jefferson&rsquo;s, a transplanted Scotsman named James Callender, who first spread the accusations about Sally. Callender was a journalist and propagandist who had written so insultingly about British politicians and even the crown that he abandoned his wife and child and escaped to the United States in 1793, one step ahead of the sedition police. He practiced the same vituperative brand of journalism in America, and was convicted in 1800 under the Sedition Act for attacks on President John Adams. Jefferson, who opposed the Federalist sedition laws, defended Callender, and pardoned him on becoming president in 1801. However, when Callender sought the position of postmaster general of Richmond, Virginia, Jefferson found him unfit for office and turned him down.</p>
<p>Callender turned on his benefactor, and in 1802 started writing about Jefferson&rsquo;s sex life. He claimed Jefferson had sired a son with &ldquo;dusky Sally,&rdquo; a &ldquo;wooly-headed concubine,&rdquo; who was part of his &ldquo;Congo harem.&rdquo; Callender wrote that Sally was a &ldquo;slut common as the pavement,&rdquo; who was &ldquo;romping with half a dozen black fellows,&rdquo; and had serviced &ldquo;fifteen or thirty gallants of all colours.&rdquo; Federalist newspapers opposed to Jefferson&rsquo;s policies circulated these stories with some effect, and Callender may have been right to claim that he had done more harm to Jefferson&rsquo;s reputation in five months than all his other critics had done in ten years.</p>
<p>Callender never claimed to have met &ldquo;dusky Sally&rdquo; or any of her children, nor did he ever explain how he got his information. Naturally, many people thought he made it up. John Adams &mdash; whom Callender called a &ldquo;hideous hermaphroditical character who has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman&rdquo; &mdash; wrote of him: &ldquo;I believe nothing Callender said. &hellip; I would not convict a dog of killing sheep upon the testimony of two such witnesses.&rdquo; Abigail Adams called him &ldquo;a libeler whom you could not but detest and despise.&rdquo; James Madison distrusted him, writing that &ldquo;it is impossible to reason concerning a man, whose imagination and passions have been so fermented.&rdquo; In 1803, Callender drowned in two or three feet of water in the James River, reportedly too drunk to fish himself out.</p>
<p><strong>Oral traditions</strong></p>
<p>The only other source for the Jefferson paternity allegations is a sketchy set of claims made by Hemings&rsquo; descendants. In 1872, 37 years after Sally&rsquo;s death and 46 years after Jefferson&rsquo;s, one of Sally&rsquo;s younger sons, Madison Hemings, gave an interview to a newspaper editor named S. F. Wetmore, in which he claimed that Jefferson was the father of all six of Sally&rsquo;s known children. The interview, which is presented as a verbatim transcription, is in flowery language that seems entirely out of keeping with the vocabulary of an ex-slave, and closely follows the Callender version, even including the mistaken spelling of Jefferson&rsquo;s father-in-law&rsquo;s name that Callender used in his own account. Mr. Hyland notes that there is no other record of Madison ever having claimed to be descended from Jefferson. Wetmore had a political interest in besmirching Jefferson&rsquo;s reputation and may well have sought Madison out and encouraged him to claim he had an illustrious father.</p>
<p>The other paternity claim was by Thomas Woodson, a somewhat mysterious black who claimed to be the son that resulted when Jefferson impregnated Sally when she was only 15 or so. This is a particularly improbable claim, since Jefferson kept detailed records of all births to his slaves, and there is no record of a child named Thomas or of a birth to Sally at about that time. Woodson&rsquo;s claim has also been disproven by DNA evidence, but this has not stopped his descendants from claiming to this day that Jefferson was the father.</p>
<div id="attachment_102302" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Monticello.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-102302" title="Monticello" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Monticello.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="288"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Was Monticello an interracial love nest?</p></div>
<p><strong>DNA</strong></p>
<p>In the late 1990s, DNA testing was carried out to see if the paternity of the Hemings children could be proven. The study was based on the fact that the Y chromosome, carried by all men, is passed intact along the male line, and is detectably different in different families. If Jefferson had fathered Sally&rsquo;s children, the male-line descendents of her sons would have the Jefferson Y chromosome.</p>
<p>Male-line descendants of the dubious Thomas Woodson and of Sally&rsquo;s last child, Eston Hemings, agreed to be tested. Interestingly, the descendants of Madison Hemings, the son who gave the Wetmore interview, refused to be tested. The results were announced with great fanfare in the November 5, 1998 issue of the British magazine <em>Nature.</em> First, as noted above, Thomas Woodson&rsquo;s claim was bogus: There was no Jefferson Y in his male line.</p>
<p>It was the other finding that got all the attention: Eston Hemings carried the Jefferson Y chromosome. On the strength of this, <em>Nature</em> titled its article &ldquo;Jefferson Fathered Slave&rsquo;s Last Child,&rdquo; but the editors knew this was deceptive. They knew that all male-line Jeffersons, including Thomas&rsquo;s brothers and their sons, carried the Jefferson Y and were equally likely, from a genetic point of view, to be the father. It was only deep into the article &mdash; farther than journalists were likely to go &mdash; that <em>Nature</em> conceded this. Subtleties like this, of course, mean nothing to crazed lefties, who have cackled with joy ever since at the idea that Monticello was a miscegenist love-nest.</p>
<p>In fact, there were no fewer than 26 Jefferson men of reproductive age living in Virginia at the time of Eston&rsquo;s conception, who could theoretically have been the father. As we will see, Thomas is not the most likely candidate.</p>
<p>There are a few other circumstantial arguments that can be made in favor of the love-nest claim. One is that Sally was reportedly light-skinned and attractive. She came to Jefferson as part of his wife&rsquo;s property, and there were even rumors that his wife&rsquo;s father was Sally&rsquo;s father. If that were true, it would mean Sally was Jefferson&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s half-sister.</p>
<p>Another argument is that Jefferson seldom freed slaves, yet he freed Madison and Eston Hemings in his will. Jefferson&rsquo;s policy was to free slaves whom he thought could support themselves, and the Hemings men had learned trades. One would also note that Jefferson did <em>not</em> free Sally, either during his life or in his will.</p>
<p>Finally, it appears that Jefferson was at Monticello at the times when Sally&rsquo;s children were conceived. However, Monticello was Jefferson&rsquo;s home, and it stands to reason he was there often. Also, no one knows where Sally was most of the time, and there are notes that indicate she was sometimes living away from Monticello.</p>

<p>So much for the case for paternity. What are the opposing arguments?</p>
<p>First, despite the lefty derision they evoke, there are Jefferson&rsquo;s views and character. He detested miscegenation, which he considered bad for both races. He also was greatly disturbed by slavery, and abhorred the sexual power masters held over female slaves. These well-publicized views add to the lefties&rsquo; glee: They can call Jefferson a hypocrite. However, he was probably the most self-controlled of all American presidents. His motto of conduct was, &ldquo;When tempted to do anything in secret, ask yourself if you would do it in public; if you would not, be sure it is wrong.&rdquo; To a remarkable extent, he lived by this standard.</p>
<p>The most lurid tale of fornication &mdash; and one Callender promoted &mdash; is that Jefferson took up with Sally while he was in Paris as Minister to France, and the 1995 movie <em>Jefferson in Paris</em> is full of amorous sport. This is deliberate provocation. Jefferson lost his wife Martha shortly before leaving for Paris, and was devastated by the loss. He promised on her deathbed that he would never remarry, and left for Paris by himself. Later he sent for his children, and someone in his household chose Sally &mdash; only 14 at the time &mdash; to be a maid for his nine-year-old daughter Mary. Along with Jefferson&rsquo;s 15-year-old daughter Martha, the girls traveled to Paris and stopped on the way in London, where they met Abigail Adams. Mrs. Adams wrote that Sally was more child than adult and therefore not a good choice for a maid. Jefferson&rsquo;s daughters, along with Sally, probably boarded at their school rather than under Jefferson&rsquo;s roof. Wherever they were living, it is unlikely that Jefferson was carrying on an affair with a 14-year-old slave girl under the noses of his daughters. All the evidence suggests that he was not a very sexual man, and there is no real record that he ever took a lover after his wife&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The charge that Jefferson fathered Eston &mdash; the son who did carry the Jefferson Y chromosome &mdash; is implausible for different reasons. Eston was born in 1808 and would have been conceived while Jefferson was in his second term. The Callender accusations had been circulating since 1802 and had been repeated with some damaging effect by Jefferson&rsquo;s enemies. Is it likely that Jefferson would risk justifying those accusations while still in office?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jefferson would have been 64 at the time of Eston&rsquo;s conception, and his letters from that period are full of complaints about migraine headaches, arthritis, and intestinal infections. Jefferson lived another 19 years after that but his health was poor. Moreover, after retiring from the presidency in 1809, Jefferson moved back permanently to Monticello, where he would have access to Sally at any time, yet Eston was her last child. In the very unlikely case that Jefferson, as a sickly, often-absent, 64-year-old Chief Executive had fathered Eston, he would presumably have had more children with Sally after he retired. Mr. Hyland notes that Sally survived Jefferson by nine years, but there is no record of her ever claiming that the president was her lover.</p>
<p>As for Madison Hemings, whose descendants refused DNA testing, his conception would have occurred in April 1805. Again, Jefferson was still president and therefore unlikely to do anything to justify accusations of miscegenation. He was present at Monticello for several weeks that month during the final illness and funeral of his daughter Mary. He was grief-stricken by her death, and the house was full of guests and mourners. Would Jefferson have been sporting with a slave concubine at such a time?</p>
<p>As she grew older, Jefferson&rsquo;s eldest daughter Martha became the de facto mistress of Monticello. Her father always liked to have her and her seven children close, and she would have been at Monticello when Sally&rsquo;s later children were conceived. She was familiar with everything that happened on the plantation and always vehemently denied the remotest possibility of any kind of impropriety between her father and any slave woman.</p>
<div id="attachment_102304" style="width: 334px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MarthaJefferson.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-102304" title="MarthaJefferson" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MarthaJefferson.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="457"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Martha, Jefferson&rsquo;s daughter, was in a position to know.</p></div>
<p>Jefferson himself never explicitly denied the Sally rumors, but during his career he faced many accusations, and adopted the policy of not dignifying them with replies. Late in life, however, he did write that of all the many scurrilous things said about him only one was true: that when he was a young bachelor he had made improper advances to the wife of an acquaintance, John Walker. This is an implicit denial of the Sally affair.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the account of a contemporary eye-witness, Jefferson&rsquo;s plantation overseer, Edmund Bacon. Bacon probably knew better than anyone what went on at Monticello. In an account of his years as Jefferson&rsquo;s overseer he briefly mentioned the paternity allegations but denied them. He wrote that instead of Jefferson he saw  &mdash;  and here the name is rubbed out of the original manuscript  &mdash;  someone else leaving Sally&rsquo;s quarters &ldquo;many a morning&rdquo; when Bacon &ldquo;went up to Monticello very early.&rdquo; His account is difficult to dismiss.</p>
<p><strong>The likely suspect</strong></p>
<p>Who, then, fathered Eston? Like many careful scholars, Mr. Hyland has a prime suspect: the president&rsquo;s younger brother, Randolph.</p>
<p>Randolph lived only 20 miles away, was often at Monticello, and was probably there at the right time. There still exists a letter from the president inviting Randolph for a visit that would have taken place exactly nine months before Eston was born. At that time he would have been a 51-year-old widower, a far more likely father than the older and ailing president.</p>
<p>Years later, a former Jefferson slave, Isaac, wrote an account of life in the slave quarters. Of Randolph, he wrote, &ldquo;Old Master&rsquo;s brother, Mass Randall, was a mighty simple man: used to come out among black people, play the fiddle and dance half the night&rdquo; &mdash; circumstances that could easily lead to dalliance. Isaac&rsquo;s account says nothing about Thomas taking an interest in slave women, and he was never known to spend his leisure time with slaves.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that at the time of Eston&rsquo;s conception Randolph had four sons, ages 18 to 26, who would also have carried the Jefferson Y. There is no record of their presence at Monticello at that time, but given the fraternizing habits of their father, it seems unlikely that they always held themselves aloof from slaves either.</p>
<p>Randolph remarried after Eston&rsquo;s birth and had several sons, so it is clear that he was potent. His new wife is said to have been a domineering woman who did not often let him go back to Monticello. Perhaps she did not want him near Sally.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ThomasJefferson.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102305" title="ThomasJefferson" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ThomasJefferson.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="326"/></a></p>
<p>Finally, the Eston family tradition was that he was descended from a Jefferson &ldquo;uncle.&rdquo; Eston would have been of Jefferson&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s generation, all of whom referred to Randolph as &ldquo;Uncle.&rdquo; This tradition fits the view that the younger brother rather than Thomas was the father.</p>
<p>There are suspected fathers of the other Hemings children. One of Jefferson&rsquo;s sisters married a man who died at age 30, leaving two sons, Sam and Peter Carr. Jefferson was very fond of the Carr brothers and treated them like his own children. Peter later admitted that both he and Sam had slept with Sally, adding that &ldquo;the old gentleman had to bear the blame&rdquo; for their misbehavior. Jefferson&rsquo;s oldest grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, believed that Jefferson was so indulgent towards the Carr brothers that he would never have suspected them of fornication.</p>
<p>There are a few other arguments and counterarguments to be made on the paternity question, and Mr. Hyland summarizes them well. It should be clear, however, that the case against Jefferson is hardly air-tight, and one would think that the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, which runs Monticello, would defend the president. Not so. The foundation drew up a committee to look into the allegations and appointed a woman named Dianne Swann-Wright to head it. She is black, and a specialist in slave oral traditions. Not surprisingly, she chose to believe the slave accounts. As one white committee member later complained, Miss Swann-Wright and at least one other member clearly reached their conclusions before they examined the evidence. Guides at Monticello are instructed to say that Jefferson was the father, and the foundation web site says all six of Sally&rsquo;s known children &ldquo;are now believed to have been Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hyland notes that aside from the fashion for mocking dead white men, the foundation may have another reason for kicking Jefferson&rsquo;s corpse: money. Promoting Monticello as a secret sex nest is good for business. In the years before the controversy, Monticello was getting about $2 million in contributions every year. After the DNA test, contributions jumped to more than $10 million a year  &mdash;  a sad commentary on how Americans approach their own history.</p>
<p>Journalists and academics took reckless joy in writing Jefferson off as a miscegenating hypocrite. There could be no greater contrast to the exquisite sensitivity with which they protect Martin Luther King, Jr. American newspapers would not mention his record of flagrant plagiarism until the British broke the story, and they have largely kept mum on King&rsquo;s well-documented philanderings and Communist associations (see &ldquo;<a href="/">The Unknown Martin Luther King, Jr</a>,&rdquo; AR, Jan. 2009). Some day, whites will be able to look at the past without seeing it through a haze of guilt. Mr. Hyland&rsquo;s book is an important step in that direction.</p>

Any of the celebrity Black women that are ogled over by society are mixed with light features such as Halle Berry, very rarely are true full-blooded Blacks considered attractive. I will tell you this and nobody mentions it; Black women love White men. They do and they aren&rsquo;t shy about it. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a few of your posts and frankly you are out of your league here. You should consider posting at a lower IQ forum where objective, critical thought isn&rsquo;t required by the readership. Here you won&rsquo;t be able to resist resorting to emotional, bigoted responses when your points and arguments fall flat.</p>

<p>BUT- this is the typical nose under the the tent with these white-culture assassins. We will take the slimmest of evidence -wrap it in thick layers of hearsay and speculation and present it as a fact with which we can impugn the entirety of white civilization or elevate someone in a mud-hut. It is not even a preponderance of evidence which would be sufficient in a civil suit, let alone beyond reasonable doubt or minimal .95 confidence level for scientific publications but never mind, it is now established immutable fact.</p>
<p>There is tremendous remaining evidence, for example of the fraudulence and infidelity of M.L. King but you can be damned sure that they don&rsquo;t have an &#8220;expert in white oral tradition&#8221; presenting these stories to the public because that would cast aspersions on the apotheosis of the Civil Rights Movement. Again, another example of using different standards when comparing races which should be challenged.</p>

<p>Cumulatively, the abundant evidence presented here from William G. Hyland&rsquo;s book makes that case.  For example, there is Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s much younger brother Randolph (51 years old vs 64 for Jefferson), who frequented Monticello and was known for his affinity for the company of the slaves,  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Master&rsquo;s brother, Mass Randall, was a mighty simple man: used to come out among black people, play the fiddle and dance half the night&rdquo; (Isaac, a former Jefferson slave).</p>
<p>Randolph also had four sons age 18 - 26 who carried the Jefferson Y-chromosome.  But tagging any of these   &mdash;   or the 20 some others in Virginia with the Jefferson Y-chromosome with miscegenation with a slave   &mdash;   is so much less satisfying than declaring definitively that an old and ailing Thomas Jefferson the father of Sally Hemings&rsquo; children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Journalists and academics took reckless joy in writing Jefferson off as a miscegenating hypocrite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verdict first; evidence last   &mdash;   if ever.</p>

<p>Anyway a man of 64 having a child with a 15 years old woman is very improvable and could be expected only of a man like Hugh Hefner openly promiscuous (even then would be difficult) not from a romantic conservative like Jefferson but liberal minds dwell mostly in the realm of fantasy and facts are never obstacles to their dogma.</p>
<p>If Jefferson was an hypocrite (something I don&rsquo;t believe) that would be resolved with better morals and not with liberality, making sure to get leaders that are not hypocrites like Obama (the biggest hypocrite).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how the left could benefit from this &#8220;yellow press&#8221; if we had a strong sense of right and wrong.</p>

You&rsquo;ll be up in arms about a pretty, playboy bunny type white girl having sexual relations with a black or other non white man, especially if she gets pregnant and has a baby by him, but if a white man has sexual relations with a pretty black (or nonwhite woman) it&rsquo;s, while not necessarily condoned, at least not publically, winked at and given a &#8220;boys will be boys attitude&#8221;.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have it both ways, you can&rsquo;t just be against miscegenation when its a pretty white woman with a black man or a mexican man or a middle eastern man, but be lukewarm about it when its a white man with a pretty black woman or nonwhite woman. Not if you want to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice, especially during school desegregation in the south, that the principle reason for white men opposing it was black boys being next to white girls. There seemed to be no concern of white boys having access to black girls.</p>

I have been around this forum for a while now and  i have never seen someone that agrees to any kind of miscegenation, we are equally displeased by it regardless if is done by a white man or woman.</p>
<p>why is it relevant if there are some hypocrites about what they say? (i dont know who have you met) as i said that gets fixed with better morals its not like &#8220;oh they did something wrong then lest institutionalize that bad behavior&#8221;. Even the wildest of animals when domesticated have attempted to copulate, even with members of another species and there relies our concern; that humans are the most domesticated  species in the planet and that can lead our most naive youngs to do very pernicious things. </p>
<p>if you are a white man im glad you are reading these comments and that you are around this page because even if now you are in some kind of campaign against us the information in here will help you to open your eyes to reality and hopefully you will stand up for your yourself and do something fro your childrens future (not succumb with guilty fear to the demands of careless, ungrateful aliens).</p>

It is much rarer, on the whole, to see white males with black females.  </p>
<p>I think the MEDIA exalts White women being with Black men  &mdash;  so basically, there&rsquo;s a lot more social pressure and social sanction in favor of white women going with black men  &mdash;  so there&rsquo;s more to talk about in terms of fighting it.  There is no particular panache for a white man to go out with even the sexiest jungle bunnies&hellip;.it&rsquo;s a lack of character, pride, and self-esteem when we dishonor our families this way though, male or female.  </p>
<p>Traditionally, and in fact throughout the annals of evolutionary biology, the male selects the female for her beauty (her ability to stimulate and inspire him) and her reproductive potential while the female selects the male for his strength and productive potential.  Interracial marriages are not famous for success on either front, but they have been sufficiently successful that groups of persons of mixed race are now discernible, and we should try to encourage that &#8220;like pursue like&#8221;&hellip;..including people of mixed heritage.  This will ultimately lead to more phenotypic and genotypic diversity, which I for one totally favor.</p>
<p>The Spanish Colonial Castes (preserved in Louisiana in the categories &#8220;Mulatto&#8221;, &#8220;Quadroon&#8221;, and Octaroon) and the South African system of categorizations of &#8220;Coloreds&#8221; properly sought to preserve the diversity of groups of equal admixture.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s any Spanish Colonial Caste category that quite captures the mess that will be the offspring of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.</p>

You should take a course in genetics. Genes do not mix, do not dilute or change.  A mixed race person inherits black &amp; white genes and most of the time &#8220;looks black&#8221; because dark genes are dominant and light genes are recessive. Also, recessive genes re-appears in next generations. The expressed gene is said to  be dominant over the unexpressed gene, which is described as recessive.  If a person of mixed black/white ancestry mate with a white, the number of white genes increase, each generation until black genes dissappear.<br/>
Some &#8220;black&#8221; parents both of mixed race, are capable of producing white children, but their white children (because they inherit only recessive genes) will not have the ability to produce black children, (because dark genes are not recessive) unless they mate with someone else who is black. If the white descendants only mate with other whites then the entire line and population will only be white even though the original ancestor was black.</p>

Some other people, believe that If whites and blacks have kids they&rsquo;re destroying the white race, because, they ignore basic genetic rules. If a black person, mates with  a white person, their children would just look black, but if those mixed children mate with another white, they would look white. </p>
<p>The genes for the white race are still there, but their opportunity to be  expressed in the children in the first generation are decreased, because black genes are dominant, but only at first generation. White genes will reappear, next generation  because white genes are recessive. </p>
<p>Some black parents, are capable of producing white children, but their white children (because they inherit only recessive genes) will not have the ability to produce black children, unless they mate with someone else who is black hair. If the white descendants only mate with other whites then the entire line and population will only be white even though the original ancestor was black. </p>

<p>There is also the fact that most blacks in Africa were already mixed with Caucasians who migrated to Africa(in stages, so by the time they got to the Congo for ex. they were mixed and had acquired genes for tropical disease resistance) and presumably spread agriculture and animal husbandry before written history.  Recent DNA analysis has revealed this.  About 5% of Bantu men have direct descent on the paternal line from the same men as most Western Europeans(and many Egyptians).  Most likely, neolithic Caucasians migrated down the Nile valley to cross the Sahara and spread out across the Sahel spreading genes and technology to the ancestors of the Bantu people and other Africans.</p>

Other circumstantial facts support the view that Jefferson was the father. Didn&rsquo;t his daughter free all of this woman&rsquo;s children? They&rsquo;ll never be a definitive answer to this question, but my feeling is, if Sally Hemings looked anything like that picture, everyone on this website is kidding themselves if they think he wouldn&rsquo;t have taken a piece of that, racist or not. Men are hypocrites when it comes to sex, the third POTUS certainly included in that category. I think this article is at best optimism and at worst outright denialism. In Jefferson&rsquo;s case, people took the cover-up at face value and didn&rsquo;t bother to really look into it, believing what they wanted to believe and acquiescing to power. But in this case, the left and the sensationalists were probably right, even if their reasons before the DNA study came out were insufficient and driven by ideology. A Jefferson was the progenitor of the Hemings&rsquo; line&hellip; the relationship between TJ and SH was fairly intimate according to all records. It&rsquo;s more likely that the daughter was protecting her father&rsquo;s legacy. So Thomas Jefferson had some kids who had about as much black in them as James Watson. So?</p>

Brilliant people do dumb things everyday. Having well thought out political or moral opinions or even strong convictions about those opinions is hardly evidence that a person actually follows them. In the case of romantic attachments and sexual relations, men are remarkably, no, notoriously, weak. Consider Bill Clinton or David Petraeus. Sexual drives are incredibly resilient to moral theorizing because for so many men they are simply overwhelming. I&rsquo;m not even sure from an evolutionary standpoint it is so remotely unintelligent (although you expressed it faultily) to spread his seed widely, no matter your feelings are about who he spreads his seed with. Although, like I said, if this woman was attractive and fit, reasonably intelligent as well, almost entirely white, and apparently motherly and decent, as the record indicates, I see little reason to think it was bad genetic &#8220;thinking&#8221;. While recognizing that this is by no means the only conception of rationallity, it seems quite rational genetically for him to do this. And the world simply wasn&rsquo;t as it is now. A man of Jefferson&rsquo;s stature and wealth would have had the capacity to achieve serious privacy, and given the mores of the times, few would have been barging into his house to crack this case. There was no paparazzi back then. There was speculation about Jefferson&rsquo;s relationship with this woman, but it&rsquo;s hard to prove without direct genetic evidence. Although now we know there was some relationship between a Jefferson and this woman. There is direct physical evidence for that.</p>

She would have been more than 18 from that time forward, and for some time already a fully developed female. The last child of theirs would have been born when Jefferson was in his mid sixties, with the first four being birthed while Jefferson was in his early or mid 50s. That&rsquo;s not really that old for a male. It&rsquo;s neither shocking, surprising, rare or insulting. I consider it pretty standard really.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man of Jefferson&rsquo;s stature and wealth would have had the capacity to<br/>
achieve serious privacy, and given the mores of the times, few would<br/>
have been barging into his house to crack this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, given that statement, we assume that the &#8220;most fit&#8221; mate that T. Jefferson could find would be a black slave; there were no accessible white women of similar social rank to to whom he might forward his affections; this was the best that he could do?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;if this woman was attractive and fit, reasonably intelligent as well,<br/>
almost entirely white, and apparently motherly and decent, as the record<br/>
 indicates&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, -IF-.  </p>
<p>You accept this hearsay and supposition on it&rsquo;s face but deny the written record of the man&rsquo;s own views on the topic and corroborating hearsay indicating that it may have been the president&rsquo;s young brother or his nephews who were reputed to have cavorted with the &#8220;darkies&#8221; with some regularity.</p>
<p>Here we have at least three classically plausible motives for the propagation of this story: </p>
<p>1. We&rsquo;re the descendants of aristocracy. (blacks seem to love the idea that they are descended from kings and queens).</p>
<p>2. It fits the &#8220;White oppression and rape of disadvantaged blacks&#8221; narrative.</p>
<p>3. Money -If not the immediate descendants of Hemmings, the present hangers-on today who have created an industry of for-profit historical revision.</p>
<p>As far as &#8220;African Oral Tradition&#8221;, it isn&rsquo;t worth the paper it&rsquo;s not written on. Blacks today claim such fantastical accomplishments as as founding Egyptian civilization and a comical list of putative inventions such as algebra,  the electrochemical battery, aircraft and that Jesus of Nazareth was &#8220;black&#8221;. </p>
<p>BZZZT! Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry; maybe in the next round.</p>

As it stands, I&rsquo;m neither of the nouns you charge me with, but I&rsquo;ll presume it&rsquo;s a lack of basic ethics that is responsible for this silly ad hominem opening argument. As for your closing remarks and list, I deny none of these truths or claims. I&rsquo;m just not sure that they&rsquo;re really all that relevant to the issue. A person can believe one thing and behave contrarily. Most men in fact do, and certainly would if given the power to, which Jefferson certainly would have had over this young woman, especially when it comes to sexual matters. Besides, in such times, one can&rsquo;t trust the alleged opinions of most political actors any more seriously than one can trust the professed opinions of modern politicians and their deep egalitarian values. Jefferson, even if he had somewhat different views than the record indicates, would have had little wiggle-room to express the nuances of his opinion during the early republic. What dismays me is the analytical skills of the people on this website, who seem unable to even consider the very strong possibility that Jefferson did in fact have children with this marginally black slave woman. It seems to me racial pride is overwhelmingly stronger than reason in most people on here. And by the way, Eston Hemings Jefferson, the offspring of this woman, was not only a successful free individual himself, after his migration to the north and acceptance in the white community, but was successful to the point that many of his descendants survive to this day, nearly all of them being classified as white*, all the way down the line, and still to this day. You can find some of their pictures online. So my claim that the decision was not a poor genetic decision seems buffered by the evidence, whether you like those facts or not. Or you can go on constructing an alternative reality you&rsquo;re more comfortable with, and doctoring history so that it pleases your ego, much like the afro-centrists. Your choice.</p>

<p>If so, then it is what it is and I&rsquo;d accept the truth of it. Look at the T.J. quote that AmRen has right on the top bar. </p>
<p>BUT- this is the typical nose under the the tent with these<br/>
white-culture assassins. We will take the slimmest of evidence -wrap it<br/>
in thick layers of hearsay and speculation and present it as a fact with<br/>
 which we can impugn the entirety of white civilization or elevate<br/>
someone in a mud-hut. It is not even a preponderance of evidence which<br/>
would be sufficient in a civil suit, let alone beyond reasonable doubt<br/>
or minimal .95 confidence level for scientific publications but never<br/>
mind, it is now established immutable fact.</p>
<p>There is tremendous remaining evidence for example, of the<br/>
fraudulence and infidelity of M.L. King but you can be damned sure that<br/>
they don&rsquo;t have an &#8220;expert in white oral tradition&#8221; presenting these<br/>
stories to the public because that would cast aspersions on the<br/>
apotheosis of the Civil Rights Movement. Again, another example of using<br/>
 different standards when comparing races which should be challenged.</p>
<p>There simply is no defense for being white.</p>
<p>In brief answer to your response, I am not claiming that this *could not* be true, nor that this never happens with saintly white people, nor (as I think that you read) that Hemming&rsquo;s living descendants are making money off of this, though they may be. There certainly is a minor industry now arisen around this because I have seen &#8220;experts&#8221; on TV discussing this concrete DNA &#8220;proof&#8221;, which it is not.  It is a part of a larger insidious agenda against which any &#8220;racist white&#8221; counterargument is dismissed.</p>
<p>Fact has no color but is usually hard to come by.</p>

TJ was a tall, attractive, intelligent man who had no problem wooing white women. I would think, like most men of his era, when given a choice he would go with his race, finding them to be more attractive. Secondly, I think TJ was intelligent and moral enough to know that 6 illegitimate slaves fathered by him would be a constant source of mockery and ruin his career, his reputation and his legacy. After being accused once, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d repeat the mistake 5 more times and with the exact same slave. Jefferson was a scholar and a man of science and new full well where babies come from, he would have employed any contraceptive devices, methods or practices available at the time to avoid any proof of his liaison.  I think his profound grief over his wife&rsquo;s death would have quelled most any desires remaining in a 50-60+ yr. old man not in the best of health. It was most likely a younger, healthier Jefferson male who had nothing to lose from the escapade.</p>

But give them an absolute certainty based on observation and facts(black crime, black intelligence, multiculturalism failures, MLK, etc.) and they will turn it into a tiny probability that only a &#8220;racist&#8221; would point out, or they will just completely ignore it and pretend like it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

The fact that there is a federal holiday for Martin Luther King&rsquo;s Birthday and none for Thomas Jefferson is just one of the horrible injustices and inequities of the topsy-turvy symbolic universe we live in.  The really horrible irony is that Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s birthday was still celebrated Statewide in Texas, Louisiana, and Virginia until quietly being dropped in the 1970s  &mdash;  some parts of Florida still celebrate (locally), but in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, and Mississippi, Lee has to share his birthday with MLK now:</p>

Peale&rsquo;s the attention to detail in other respects seems as fine as any other portraits of Jefferson I can find, so it seems hard to believe he would make a mistake like that.<br/>
Maybe one of our scholars out there knows?</p>

<p>His eyes were generally considered to be light blue/gray, but I do believe they were the type that either changed to a slight degree during his lifetime, or at least people have described him as having hazel(ish) eyes with a gray/blue mixture. What was not in question was that his eyes were described as very light, so that makes it possible that all descriptions of his eye color could be accurate to at least some degree.</p>
<p>With all this &#8220;diversity&#8221; that is claimed White people are missing, I find it astonishing that we are the only people on this planet that could be having this conversation of variety and diversity in our people.</p>

My dad had gray eyes and depending on the light might have looked hazel(ish). The background in the Peale portrait is brown so that probably explains it. </p>

<p>The idea of &#8220;innocent until proven guilty&#8221; applies everywhere and I may add has helped quite a few of your people out. Use sources and evidence instead of being idiotic, don&rsquo;t just spew anecdotal evidence over and over, the same thing you&rsquo;ve accused another commenter of doing I may add. </p>
<p>Many, MANY more blacks fall into those category currently than whites, even going back into history. Guess who sold your people into slavery (HINT: they were melanin enriched). Guess who commits the most rapes per capita in the USA (HINT: it&rsquo;s not us). Guess where rape is so common and not even looked down upon that women from that place are systematically raped and murdered in truly soul crushing numbers (HINT: the Belgians used to own it. Another HINT: it&rsquo;s in central Africa, I doubt the first hint would have helped you much). Guess whose home continent is a disgusting, filth ridden hell-hole that it has been declared beyond saving far too many times to count, this is a tough one. (HINT: not Europeans, nationals from either of the Americas, Asians, Australians, or even Antarcticans). </p>
<p>Grow up, if you think that your people are somehow superior post sources that back you up. If you are correct I will dump my girlfriend and marry and black woman and throw away my blond hair and blue eyes so that no new generation may be cursed with &#8220;white privilege&#8221; even if they are from a white country. Just to add an extra layer of difficulty; only use actual scientific peer reviewed sources, no hear-say, no Afro-centric websites (I even capitalized the A, see how tolerant I am?).</p>

<p>Those on the right in contemporary American politics often quote passages from the writings of Thomas Jefferson. Nevertheless, within the context of his era he was on the left. He supported the French Revolution until it turned bad with the Reign of Terror. He opposed the power of European aristocracies and the mercantile elite in the United States. He was one of the founders of what became the Democratic Party .</p>

Certainly, all those very white looking black people didn&rsquo;t just appear from a space ship. Sorry, I agree with Mr. Taylor on many things but not here. Jefferson, whom I&rsquo;ve read nearly three dozen books on, had sex and pro-created with non- whites. It was what white males and even some female owners did. It is written within countless diaries and historical records and mainly in this country it is in 19th and early 20th century photos and faces of US Blacks who look all or near white. Mixed marriages were outlawed back then so slave rape and consensual sex was where their mostly white ancestry originated. That&rsquo;s US and world history and frankly as a white person it does not threaten me.</p>

Even if it that is true, are you sure that is the stand you want to take?  It&rsquo;s not that weird though.  They aren&rsquo;t interested in the pursuit of facts or history per say; they find facts are only useful when they can be used as weapons.  They aren&rsquo;t even arguments actually.  They are the introductory statement to an argument you are already supposed to have learned in school.  The fact that one can take many different interpretations from the &#8216;facts&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t really taught anymore.  For example, when discussing Hitler in circumstances where I can&rsquo;t get fired, and the inevitable person says, &#8220;but wasn&rsquo;t Hitler partially Jewish?&#8221;  I always reply, &#8220;Are you sure that that isn&rsquo;t an argument against miscegenation?&#8221;  Even if TJ did father those children, I&rsquo;m not going to throw the baby out with the bath water and disregard everything he&rsquo;s said (imagine if we held black leaders to a similar standard).  Besides to quote Christ, &#8220;let he who is without sin, cast the first stone.&#8221;  Show me someone who hasn&rsquo;t been a hypocrite at some point, particularly on the left.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t find leftists to be weird, but their motivations perplex the hell out of me.</p>

Chernow quotes a letter of Martha Washington&rsquo;s saying that a social call by Jefferson to Mount Vernon was &#8220;the second worst day of my life.&#8221; (The worst was the day her husband died.) The Washingtons had good reason to detest Jefferson. He was devious, duplicitous, and given to wild, unsubstantiated accusations that members of Washington&rsquo;s political party were crypto-monarchists. Today we&rsquo;d call him a wingnut, a birther, a conspiracy theorist. I still admire Jefferson tremendously for his vast learning and accomplishments, but he definitely had some serious flaws. Whether he had sex with his wife&rsquo;s half-sister, a pretty quadroon slave, seems a matter of very slight importance.</p>

It was common practice for slave owners to sleep with their slaves at that time. Even today, white men and women seem largely attracted to races of color&hellip; to the extent that white women want fuller lips and figures that they seem to have lost genetically. Given that the cradle of civilization was in the Middle Eastern/North African region, I believe there is something innate within us that recognizes that &#8220;original&#8221; man or woman as the ideal image of beauty. Since all races had to have come from one race at some point&hellip; it makes sense that on some level we seek to contribute our genes for the recreation of that master race.</p>
