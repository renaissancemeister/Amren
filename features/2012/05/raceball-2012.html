	                	<p>On Easter Sunday, two weeks into the 2012 Major League Baseball season, the late Jackie Robinson was worshipped, as he is every April 15th. Every player and coach in all 15 games played that day wore Robinson&rsquo;s number 42 to pay tribute to the man who broke baseball&rsquo;s &ldquo;color barrier&rdquo; in 1947. And, as has been the case in recent years, Jackie Robinson Day provided the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/story/2012-04-15/baseball-jackie-robinson/54302108/1">perfect opportunity</a> for black baseball players, Robinson&rsquo;s white former friends, and even baseball&rsquo;s white commissioner to complain that there are not enough blacks in the sport. In the upcoming months, there will be more of this hand-wringing.</p>
<p>In truth, it&rsquo;s not really black players who are underrepresented, but rather American-born blacks, as AR has <a href="/ar/2010/11/index.html#article1">previously noted</a>. Los Angeles Angels right-fielder Torii Hunter clarified this distinction for us when he called non-American black ballplayers &ldquo;<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/mlb/news/story?id=4983236">impostors</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although blacks are 13 percent of the US population, they account for only 7.7 percent of the players on the 30 current MLB teams, or 66 out of 853 players. That was down from <a href="../../../RGRC/2011/2011_MLB_RGRC_FINAL.pdf">8.5 percent </a>Â last year, and way down from a high of <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/jackie/news/story?id=2828584">27 percent</a> in the mid 1970s.</p>

<p>The current lows are a great worry to &ldquo;racism&rdquo;-hunting organizations like the TIDES Foundation and its diversity czar, Richard Lapchick, and to outspoken black ballplayers such as Jimmy Rollins, C.C. Sabathia, and Mr. Hunter. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to them that including foreign-born blacks brings the total black percentage to 18.8 percent. We must redouble our efforts to get more American blacks on the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to get better,&rdquo; laments baseball commissioner Mr. Selig, as reported by the <em>USA Today</em>, but black former star pitcher Dave Stewart<strong> </strong>is not satisfied: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not getting better. It&rsquo;s only getting worse. We&rsquo;ve been in a downward spiral for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart is also angry because only two of MLB&rsquo;s 30 managers and two of 30 general managers are American-born blacks. He says team owners &ldquo;don&rsquo;t want to hire blacks as decision makers,&rdquo; and claims that white managers get second and third chances with different teams, while black managers get passed over. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a joke,&rdquo; he complains.</p>
<p>But why are African-American players underrepresented by more than 40 percent in pro baseball? Los Angeles Angels pitcher <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2010-03-09-part-3-baseball-roundtable_N.htm">LaTroy Hawkins says</a> scouts are afraid to venture into dangerous inner-city areas where blacks play. Mr. Hawkins may have touched on a minor factor, but there are other explanations.</p>
<p>One is culture. After all, there are plenty of blacks in baseball, just not as many American blacks as there used to be. There are more blacks &mdash; 75 of the 95 foreign-born blacks in baseball &mdash; from the Dominican Republic than there are American blacks.</p>
<div id="attachment_99689" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 308px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/HanleyRamirez.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-99689" title="HanleyRamirez" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/HanleyRamirez.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="410"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hanley Ramirez, one of the better-known Dominican blacks in the MLB.</p></div>
<p>What makes the D.R. different? There, baseball is a way of life, more specifically, a way out of poverty. It is a way to make it big on the shores of the world power just 800 miles to the north. Also, baseball is by far the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic. There are only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_NBA_players">three</a> Dominicans playing professional basketball in America, and only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_in_the_Dominican_Republic">one</a> in professional football.</p>
<p>Culture and childhood experience probably explain why ice hockey, for example, has hardly any blacks. While it certainly helps to have <em>some</em> brains in hockey, the sport is more like basketball and football, in that physical skill and conditioning are more important. But hockey is a northern sport. Seven of the National Hockey League&rsquo;s 30 teams are based in Canada, while professional baseball and basketball each have only one Canadian team. There are no NFL teams in Canada. Hockey is <em>the</em> major sport in Canada, and not many blacks live there. On the other hand, in the American South, where there are many blacks, hardly anyone pays attention to hockey. At the same time, hockey does not require jumping ability, which blacks use to great advantage in football and basketball.</p>
<p>Another explanation for why there are fewer American blacks playing baseball than before could be the number of fatherless homes. Many, if not most, successful baseball players learned the game from their fathers in the backyard, with two mitts, a ball, and a bat. More than 70 percent of black boys are born to single mothers, and with no father to teach them baseball, are likely to pick up a basketball and head down to the local park.</p>
<div id="attachment_99690" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/FatherSon.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-99690  " title="FatherSon" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/FatherSon.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="301"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Probably not common with black fathers and sons.</p></div>
<p>Another explanation may be the increase in the number of blacks in <a href="../../../RGRC/2011/2011_NBA_RGRC_FINAL_20FINAL.pdf">basketball</a> and <a href="../../../RGRC/2011/RGRC_NFL_2011_FINAL.pdf">football</a>, which are both more than two-thirds black. In any population, there are only so many people with the potential to be top athletes, and if more blacks gravitate to other sports there will be fewer left for baseball.</p>
<p>Racial differences may have something to do with the shift, too. Basketball and football require raw athletic prowess &mdash; something blacks clearly have. Most positions in these two sports do not require a great deal of intelligence, which makes them natural homes for physically gifted blacks. Some would argue that baseball is more of a thinking man&rsquo;s game. Strategy and good decision-making skills are essential to success, though this is truer for some positions than others.</p>
<p>Within a given sport, intelligence appears to explain part of the racial distribution of the different positions. Much has been made of the fact that most NFL quarterbacks are white. Fans and commentators agree that quarterback is the most important position of the football field, and with good reason: It requires the most brains (see <a href="#article2"><em>Quarterbacks, Intelligence, and Race</em></a>, July 2011 <em>American Renaissance</em>). Quarterbacks must know the playbook inside out, and make important decisions after the ball is snapped. Running back and wide receiver &mdash; generally dominated by blacks &mdash; are positions with mostly physical demands: running, jumping, and catching and holding the ball.</p>
<p>In baseball, the most mentally demanding positions are catcher and pitcher. The catcher directs fielders to the proper locations before each at bat. He also decides which pitches the pitcher should throw. In order to do this, he needs to know the habits and weaknesses of each opposing batter who comes to the plate. As of this writing, there are 67 catchers in the Major Leagues, and not one is African-American, though four are foreign-born blacks. Despite making up 18.8 percent of MLB rosters, only 6 percent of catchers are blacks of any nationality.</p>

<p>The pitcher also has to be smart. Like the catcher, he must know which pitches each hitter prefers, and which he doesn&rsquo;t, but the pitcher must also know which part of the strike zone to aim for. Moreover, the relationship of a pitcher with his catcher is clearly the most important tandem on the field. At the start of the current season, there were 431 pitchers playing professional baseball (more than half of all pro baseball players are pitchers) and only 11 (2.6 percent) were African-American. Another 12.1 percent of MLB pitchers are foreign-born blacks, so while blacks in total make up 18.8 percent of the players, only 14.7 percent of pitchers are black. Whites, who are 61.5 percent of the players, account for 68 percent of the pitchers.</p>

<p>The outfield is where speed is most important in baseball. Outfielders must cover far more ground than infielders, pitchers, or catchers. It shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, then, that blacks (and especially African-Americans) are overrepresented in the three outfield positions. While 18.8 percent of baseball is black, fully 32 percent of outfielders are black. The overrepresentation is even more pronounced among African-Americans, who account for 7.7 percent of the players, but 25.5 percent of all outfielders.</p>

<p>Organizations like TIDES and people like Richard Lapchick exist solely to lambaste professional sports for being too white. In 2011, TIDES gave the NBA <a href="/ar/2010/11/index.html#article1">an A+ for racial diversity</a>, despite the fact that the league was 78 percent black. In other words, TIDES does not really care how diverse teams are, only how colored they are. The fewer whites the better.</p>
<p>But even with TIDES trying to sniff out &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; major disparities will remain. General managers and owners are interested in winning games, not satisfying the wishes of diversity preachers like Mr. Lapchick. No matter how many report cards TIDES issues, it cannot change mental, physical, and cultural differences, and these will always affect which athletes excel in and at what sports and at what positions.</p>

<p>AKA, the dork in Orlando with a fax machine.Â  We hear from that one every December and March, when the teams that will compete in the college football BCS bowl games and the basketball tournament, respectively.Â  Dorky Dorkenstein analyzes them for their graduation rates, then duly reports on/whines about the race disparities.Â  Note that this TIDES is not George Soros&rsquo;s TIDES.</p>
<p><i>What makes the D.R. different? There, baseball is a way of life, more<br/>
specifically, a way out of poverty. It is a way to make it big on the<br/>
shores of the world power just 800 miles to the north. Also, baseball is<br/>
 by far the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic. There are only<br/>
 three Dominicans playing professional basketball in America, and only one in professional football.</i></p>
<p>That and MLB rules and American legal immigration rules means that a 16-year old from the DR can be signed into the minor leagues, (with fake DR birth certificates being rampant, a &#8220;16 year old&#8221; Dominican is more like 15 or 14, just like a &#8220;32 year old Dominican&#8221; named Albert Pujols is more like 36), while an American has to wait until he graduates from high school or equivalent.Â  This is why Bryce Harper skipped his final two years of regular high school to enter the GED program at a junior college in Las Vegas, so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to wait around to get drafted.</p>
<p><i>But why are African-American players underrepresented by more than 40 percent in pro baseball? Los Angeles Angels pitcher LaTroy Hawkins says<br/>
 scouts are afraid to venture into dangerous inner-city areas where<br/>
blacks play. Mr. Hawkins may have touched on a minor factor, but there<br/>
are other explanations.</i></p>
<p>A few years ago, Angels player Torii Hunter said that his teammate Vladimir Guerrero wasn&rsquo;tÂ  a true black.Â  Except they both look very much alike, the average person couldn&rsquo;t tell one from the other.</p>
<p><i>Some would argue that baseball is more of a thinking man&rsquo;s game.<br/>
Strategy and good decision-making skills are essential to success,<br/>
though this is truer for some positions than others.</i></p>
<p>Baseball tends to reward self-sacrifice and impulse control a little more.</p>
<p><i>On Easter Sunday, two weeks into the 2012 Major League Baseball season,<br/>
the late Jackie Robinson was worshipped, as he is every April 15th.<br/>
Every player and coach in all 15 games played that day wore Robinson&rsquo;s<br/>
number 42 to pay tribute to the man who broke baseball&rsquo;s &ldquo;color barrier&rdquo;<br/>
 in 1947. </i></p>
<p>On the 60th anniversary of the <i>sacred event</i> which was in 2007, Yahoo republished the mainstream media accounts of the Dodgers game that day, from the New York papers and the national wire services.Â  It&rsquo;s now considered a day almost akin to a holy nativity.Â  But the media that night and the next morning sure didn&rsquo;t notice it.Â  Almost all of the media copy mentioned Robinson as the first black in a regular season major league game as an afterthought, deep down into the paragraph count, focused more on what he did and how he played than what he looked like.Â  The <i>New York Post</i> referred to him (28 years old on that day) as a &#8220;colored boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Words can indeed make powerful weapons, and I stand by my statement that day; that Bud Selig&rsquo;s worship of Robinson borders on necrophilia. That&rsquo;s one thing - but to permanently retire the 42 uniform number on the one hand, and then to make EVERY player wear that number on the same day is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Selig fails to understand that not everybody loves Jackie Robinson as much as he does. He doesn&rsquo;t take into account that some players, especially the younger ones, might resent having to wear a different number.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-86986" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Baseball can&rsquo;t be outsourced. But player development can be, and has. Why wouldn&rsquo;t African Americans be impacted by this more than anyone else? Other factors also operate, of course, including just plain decline in interest, but why can&rsquo;t the outsourcing of talent development to Latin America and even Asia beÂ  identified as a factor.</p>
<p>Another factor is that the aspiring MLB player has to be willing to play in minor leagues for years, usually, in return for a very small chance of making the bigs. What is the attraction of minor league life compared to up five years on campus with all the glory and &#8220;bennies&#8221; ofÂ  being varsity athlete? Doesn&rsquo;t compare. Not to mention, I don&rsquo;t think organized baseball wants players with criminal propensities in the minor leagues system. Colleges seem not to care. Now that I think about it, college campuses are pretty criminal places as is it. Activities that are considered crimes elsewhere are treated with the student body as rules violation. True for all students, not just athletes. </p>

But it can explain why some people are absent entirely. The simple explanation is that coaches, general managers and athletic directors want to be scrutinized as little as possible for their failures. &#8220;Caste&#8221;, therefore, becomes a kind of protective coloration, in this case literally. Depending on the sport, get all black kids or all white kids, and if you end up with a losing team, there is less commotion.</p>
<p>On a pro level, particularly in the NFL, the league can only work with the talent the colleges create. In the NBA, I&rsquo;m not so sure about what&rsquo;s going on. No star or superstar level talent is going to be ignored. As to rest of the roster, I&rsquo;m not so sure. To me, the NBA is a shady venture. It is an easy game to fix in that the referees often can control the outcome of a game and a series. And seem very often to do so.</p>
<p>Sport is a huge spectacle, with fans whose rationality is poisoned by blind loyalty, gambling and intoxication. On a college level, big dollars are stake. At private colleges, major sports bring back the alums, who are then plied for donations with booze, pageantry and sexy coeds. At public colleges, successful athletic programs shake money loose from the state legislature. All colleges benefit, which is why lesser institutions within a given state are so willing to support a flagship program. Think Ohio State, for example. Or Texas. Or Alabama. Not just big business. A bigger business than most people can imagine. </p>

<p>&#8220;Several studies of boys in the 1970s and 1980s . . . found that African American boys were taller and heavier and matured earlier than white boys of the same age . . .&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently published data from the Bogalusa Heart Study on secular trends in the heights of children found height increases among  9- to 12-year-old African American boys from 1973 to 1992 to be almost twice as large as those among white boys.&#8221; </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;These NHANES [Estimates From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey] III data indicate significant differences among white, African American, and Mexican American boys in the age of onset of pubertal characteristics; African American boys showed pubic hair growth approximately 9 months earlier than white boys&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;there was a difference of 1 year between white or Mexican American boys and African American boys in the age at completion of genital development, with the latter being younger.&#8221;</p>
<p>COMMENT: It is cruel to send white boys an black boys to schoolÂ to the same schools.Â  Athletically, white boys Â need more time to develop.Â  Likewise, black boys areÂ academically not ready to compete with white boys of the same age.Â Â </p>

<p>Steve the Sailer Man observed that almost all of the few white Americans in the NBA went to high schools that are almost all white.Â  If the high school is all white, then the basketball team has no choice but to be all white, therefore giving less developed whites a chance to develop.Â  If the school has any significant percentage of blacks, the basketball (and football) team will be disproportionately black because of the black supremacy cultists that serve as coaches.</p>

<p>Whatever the reasons behind the phenomenon (white athletes doing much better in the long run if they have little contact with blacks early on)   &mdash;   relative physical immaturity to same-age black peers OR &#8220;the cult of black athletic supremacy in football and basketyball&#8221; OR both, there is no denying that reality:</p>

<p>I wanted to add to this the idea that Asians also mature sooner intellectually than whites.</p>
<p>I have gone to school with Asians for many years, and have noticed that they seem to hit their peak of ability in schoolwork sooner, and then tail off.</p>
<p>I think someone linked to a story a while back, about how Asians do less well in college than whites over time.Â  </p>
<p>Luckily, it is a GOOD thing that the brightest whites aren&rsquo;t going to Harvard, Yale, etc.Â  These placed distort truth worse than anywhere, enabling Whites to escape these places, and actually research truth.<br/>

Maybe the Manifest Destiny concept has run its course. The Southeast has always been the African American homeland and the Southwest quadrant had a Spanish civilization before it had an Anglo one, especially in California.</p>

<p>IMHO that paragraph should have been at the very top of the &#8220;explanations&#8221; list. For confirmation, watch the Little League World Series this summer. At last year&rsquo;s tournament there were almost no blacks on any of the eight US teams in Williamsport, and very few in the regional tournaments. Ditto the &#8220;Saudi Arabian&#8221; side, which except for one or two token Saudis is composed solely of Americans whose fathers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramco#Timeline" rel="nofollow">Saudi Aramco</a> employees. I&rsquo;ve been watching the LLWS ever since ESPN/ABC started televising it ~12 years ago, and the number of black players has shrunk significantly (with the obvious exception of the Caribbean team).</p>

<p>Baseball is also a slowerÂ paced game, requiring much more patience than basketball. It can be an hour into the game before a ball gets near outfield.Â  Athletes who like constant motion would go nuts if they had to hover near a base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Culture and childhood experience probably explain why ice hockey, for example, has hardly any blacks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I do think cultural influences have a lot to do with what sports we pick up. In my family we had ice skates by the time we could walk. I live in a cold climate, where skating and hockey are big time sports. Even though I grew up in a mixed neighborhood, roughly 50/50 black and white, there were never any black kids at the ice rink. Needless to say, but it was the only place black kids did not harass white kids. Have you ever tried to run on ice with boots? Not happening. There seems to be another factor though, and that is the tolerance for cold. Maybe I&rsquo;m going off on a tangent, but it is somewhat related. Whites seem toÂ tolerate the cold much better than blacks. My white friends, siblings and I wouldÂ skate for hours, almostÂ freeze to death, and go home thinking we just had the best time of our lives. Most blacks I&rsquo;ve met hate the cold, andÂ I&rsquo;mÂ not talking about a small sampling, as I lived, worked, and churched with them for almost 30 years, and in all that time I&rsquo;ve never met a black person who likes the cold. Never.</p>
<p>Then there is swimming. I was on the swim team in high school, and just like the ice rink, it was all white (with the exception of one mixed girl), even though the school was 50% black. I can understand why blacks don&rsquo;t skate, but I can&rsquo;t understand why they steer clear of the swimming pool. Kids in general love playing in the water, and there are plenty of lakes and rivers everywhere, yet it seems there are a disproportionate number of blacks that are afraid of the water. </p>

It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if Bud Selig ordered all the playoff teams to burn 42 candles in his &#8220;honor&#8221;, and observe one minute and 42 SECONDS (my emphasis) of silence before each game.</p>
<p>When Dale Earnhardt was killed at Daytona in 2001, the fans at the next race, stood up on Lap number 3 and held three fingers aloft as a &#8220;silent tribute&#8221; (Earnhardt drove Car No. 3, of course). Eventually, even the TV broadcasters observed a moment of silece on Lap 3 of every race that season. Nobody ordered them to do this - it was just something the NASCAR fans did spontaneously.</p>
<p>Compare that to Selig the commissioner, who has built a &#8220;cult of personality&#8221; around Jackie Robinson. He&rsquo;s no better than North Korea building a cult of personality around the Kim clan.</p>

Disproportionate environmental regulations, saliently CAFE standards. Generally, economic disabilities imposed on the Great Lakes region by culturally hostile coastal liberals. Blue collar whites were devastated and have yet to recover. Black were devastated even more than whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bold peasantry, a nation&rsquo;s pride, once destroyed can never be supplied.&#8221; Oliver Goldsmith, c. 1770.</p>
<p>In our age, you can say the same thing about our industrial workforce, once the nation&rsquo;s pride.</p>
