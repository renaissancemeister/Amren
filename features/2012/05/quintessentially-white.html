	                	<p>It is hard to think of behavior that is genuinely exclusive to one race. Naming one&rsquo;s daughter Quaneesha or leaving one&rsquo;s estate to the Sons of Confederate Veterans are as close as anything I can think of, but there are others that are not far off: <a href="/news/2012/05/man-with-30-kids-cant-pay-child-support.html">having 30 children by 11 women</a>, volunteering for the Red Cross, or living under a bridge after a career with the NFL. Certain things just seem to be quintessentially black or white.</p>
<p>It occurred to me, as I read the last few pages of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IE9REO/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004IE9REO">Barchester Towers</a></em>, that a taste for Anthony Trollope is something else that sends an almost unerring racial signal. You could add &ldquo;reads Trollope&rdquo; to the profile of people you would like to meet through a dating service, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have to specify race. Assuming Detroit still has public libraries, I would guess that the few lonely Trollope volumes never leave the shelves.</p>
<p>Trollope is one of my favorite authors &mdash; I have read a dozen of his novels &mdash; but probably even in the eyes of most whites he has little to recommend him. In <em>Barchester Towers</em> there is no sex. There is no violence &mdash; with the exception of a lady who soundly boxes the ear of a man who forgets himself so far as to put his arm around her waist. There are no car chases &mdash; cars had not been invented &mdash; no shipwrecks, no abductions, no mistaken identities, no great matters of state, in fact, nothing that would make for <em>excitement</em> by contemporary standards.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BarchesterTowers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-99936" title="BarchesterTowers" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BarchesterTowers.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="408"/></a></p>
<p><em>Barchester Towers</em> is a story of 19th-century church politics, set in the fictional British cathedral town of Barchester. Most of the characters are curates, chaplains, archdeacons, bishops, minor canons, deans, prebendaries, and their families. I don&rsquo;t know how it would be possible to make a novel sound more boring. But Trollope was a genius, who filled his stories with finely drawn personalities whose passions and follies and triumphs and weaknesses are as vivid as anything in literature. Within the unpromising limits of rural England, he invents high drama that is all the more compelling because his characters <em>are</em> so ordinary.</p>
<p>I greatly admire Trollope&rsquo;s ability to portray the subtleties of human behavior. He analyzes motives and describes choices with great assurance and considerable wit. It must be admitted that he sometimes puts his characters into improbable fixes, but this only gives him a greater range of emotions to depict. To read one of his novels is to take a tour of the human mind, with one of the English language&rsquo;s great stylists as your guide.</p>
<p>Trollope wrote in sentences that are sometimes long but always well crafted. He makes classical allusions. He expects his readers to enjoy language as much as he does, and to be unafraid of antique and unusual turns of phrase. In other words, people who are forced to read him before they are old enough to understand him hate him just as they hate Shakespeare or Dickens, but for those who discover him when they are ready, he is pure joy.</p>
<p>I skimped in my description of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IE9REO/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004IE9REO">Barchester Towers</a></em>. It is about church politics, but it is also about love. With few exceptions, Trollope&rsquo;s novels follow at least one couple to the point of a declaration, but there are always snags, and the lady is as likely to spurn her lover as she is to accept him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why reviewers of novels so seldom let the novelist speak for himself, but Trollope is worth quoting almost at random. Here he describes the state of mind of a 40-year-old prelate, who has become acquainted with an agreeable young widow:</p>
<blockquote><p>He had, as was his wont, asked himself a great many questions, and given himself a great many answers; and the upshot of this was that he had set himself down for an ass. He had determined that he was much too old and much too rusty to commence the manoeuvres of love-making; that he had let the time slip through his hands which should have been used for such purposes; and that now he must lie on his bed as he had made it. Then he asked himself whether in truth he did love this woman; and he answered himself, not without a long struggle, but at least honestly, that he certainly did love her. . . He also decided that Eleanor did not care a straw for him. Then he made up his mind not to think of her any more, and went on thinking of her till he was almost in a state to drown himself in the little brook which ran at the bottom of the archdeacon&rsquo;s grounds.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here is the redoubtable Signora Neroni, ravishingly beautiful, but a married woman and a cripple who must spend her life on a couch. She fascinates all men who meet her, including the unfortunate Mr. Slope:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for the signora . . . she cared no more for Mr Slope than she did for twenty others who had been at her feet before him. She willingly, nay greedily, accepted his homage. He was the finest fly that Barchester had hitherto afforded to her web; and the signora was a powerful spider that made wondrous webs, and could in no way live without catching flies. Her taste in this respect was abominable, for she had no use for the victims when caught. She could not eat them matrimonially as young lady-flies do whose webs are most frequently of their mother&rsquo;s weaving. Nor could she devour them by any escapade of a less legitimate description. Her unfortunate affliction precluded her from all hope of levanting with a lover. It would be impossible to run away with a lady who required three servants to move her from a sofa. . . .</p>
<p>Mr. Slope was madly in love, but hardly knew it. The signora spitted him, as a boy does a cockchafer on a cork, that she might enjoy the energetic agony of his gyrations. And she knew very well what she was doing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, ladies do not like the signora, and Mrs. Proudie, the bishop&rsquo;s wife, does not even leaven her feelings with any hope of reform:</p>
<blockquote><p>Her dislike of Signora Neroni was too deep to admit of her even hoping that that lady should see the error of her ways. Mrs. Proudie looked on the signora as one of the lost, &mdash; one of those beyond the reach of Christian charity, and was therefore able to enjoy the luxury of hating her, without the drawback of wishing her eventually well out of her sins.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sentences like these were not written for speed reading, but they are full of entertainment for those who take the time to find it. Some people like this kind of writing and some don&rsquo;t. Some people like opera and some don&rsquo;t. But I think it is hard to like Anthony Trollope and not be white.</p>
<p>This is hardly unique to Trollope, of course. All the great authors of Western literature &mdash; and some critics do not even rank Trollope among the really great &mdash; have the same subtle understanding of human nature and make the same demands on readers. They appeal to a sensibility that is not only thoroughly adult, but adult in a way that is thoroughly European. I suppose there must be a few Frenchified Senegalese who read Stendahl for pleasure, but it takes a real effort of imagination to conjure them up.</p>
<p>And this, of course, is one of the reasons why curricula are changing. Hispanics and blacks do not see the point of reading Tolstoy or studying Italian, and as their share of the population increases, colleges and high schools will give up trying even to get whites to do these things. And some unfortunate whites who have been taught to think that Alice Walker and Rigoberta Menchu are great writers will never discover what great writing really is.</p>
<p>I am not saying that you have to read Antony Trollope to be genuinely white; far from it. But those who have not read yet him have in store an experience that is, I believe, quintessentially white.</p>

<p>This guy Trollope-though I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with him-seems to create the effect of a deeply intellectual person maneuvering tiny characters around on a stage in his head. Kipling was grandiosely extroverted, yet at times deeply emotional, perhaps most so in &#8220;The Light That Failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a teenager, it was hard for me to reconcile how an author could be so tied in to human feelings while glorifying empire and the virtues of being white. In the years since Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and such though, it&rsquo;s become easier to reconcile as well as to understand that, while not everything white people do is unambiguously good, we certainly do it thoroughly and on a grand scale.</p>

<p>I quite agree, Christian Europe is collapsing, over run by Cultural Marxism, Islam and Africans.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of The Three Days of Darkness ? Google it. Padre Pio had a vision of it and if Padre Pio had a vision of it, you know it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Now you may think it&rsquo;s preposterous but then if I said to you in 1980 two airplanes will crash into the Twin Towers in 2001. You would think I was mad.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-93703" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&rsquo;d have to disagree with Mr. Taylor on this- although in a convoluted way. As I see it- and, I&rsquo;d say, other non-PC critics- greatest Western narrative authors are so entrancing because they are so universal or, to be more precise- they have described or expressed the human potential in the fullest- unlike other cultures&rsquo;/races&rsquo; authors (most of them). </p>
<p>I would replace &#8220;White&#8221; in descriptions of Trollope &amp; others with &#8220;most developed&#8221; or &#8220;universal&#8221;. But- I don&rsquo;t see anything particularly White about them. And, more importantly- the great Hispanic, Japanese, Black &hellip; authors are influenced by them, so it&rsquo;s not that White great fiction writers are incomprehensible to mentally developed Indians or Chinese or Blacks- they&rsquo;re just absolutely irrelevant to Black &amp; Hispanic &amp; .. thugs &amp; lowlife parasites.</p>
<p>We know that Gabriel Garcia Marquez&rsquo;s greatest influences are Faulkner, Dostoevsky, Conrad and Kafka; for Murakami, the greatest author is Dostoevsky; Yukio Mishima was influenced by Racine and Thomas Mann; Ralph Ellison by Dostoevsky and Kafka; Toni Morrison-although she denies it- by Faulkner;&hellip;</p>
<p>But, yes&hellip;what can Milton, Chekhov, Emerson, Conrad, Proust,.. say to average contemporary Black- even if he&rsquo;s not a thug ?</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-93803" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Mr. Taylor has raised a much needed issue: What writers are the Whitest of the White?  </p>
<p>Besides the explicitly White, such as insightful racists like Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, John Campbell, Hinton Rowan Helper, Charles Carroll, Lothrop Stoddard, Madison Grant, Thomas Dixon, Anthony Jacob, Carlton Putnam, Jean Raspial, and Wilmot Robertson, we also need to list implicit Whites, i.e. those who appeal to Whites Only.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine N&rsquo;groes reading for pleasure and  uplift a Cervantes, Samuel Johnson, or Jane Austen, or Herman Melville, or Robert Penn Warren. Or the women diarists who survived the Yankee war against the Southern people, and who wrote from explicit Whiteness  when describing, in cryptic terms,  the sexual immorality of black females.</p>
<p>Will Mr. Taylor please give us his master reading list for literate Whites Only enrichment?</p>
<p>I may be just a vile, sick, ignorant racist who bitterly clings to his loaded guns and White religion, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that the blacks don&rsquo;t enjoy Scots Wa Hae, Muleskinner Blues, or I Walk the Line, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll listen to next. </p>

One of the most fascinating friends I ever had, who was a black English professor at Howard University, loved Robert Penn Warren. He was fluent in German and French. He was also getting a PhD. For his foreign language requirement he was learning ancient Greek. When I asked him why he was learning such a difficult language when he already knew French and German he replied, &#8220;I want to show those white boys what I can do.&#8221; <br/>
          <br/>
Because he was attractive and charming half the girls in his freshman English class had a crush on him. He had too much integrity to take advantage of that, however. </p>

I was thinking of the Japanese as I wrote this article, but was not quite sure how to work them in. They have a deep understanding of the subtlety of human behavior and motivations that is equal to ours. I have read Mishima in Japanese (though I think his translator, Edward Seidensticker writes as beautifully as Mishima does), and I have read The Tale of Genji in translation. To some degree, an appreciation of literature is  a matter of high IQ.</p>
<p>I did look up Trollope on Japanese Amazon and found that only two translations are in print: The Warden and Barchester Towers. Trollope would be fiendishly hard to translate.</p>

Secondly, I always chuckle when people speak of societal evolution. They have this vision that one day, we will all be little floating orbs of light. I think of Newton&rsquo;s &#8220;Principia Mathematica&#8221; written in the 17th century during the Plague and chuckle- there isn&rsquo;t a single living black on this planet today that could understand what he wrote 350 years ago. </p>

<p>If the Declaration of Independce were written today, (and it would probably be called the Declaration of Interdependence), there would be basic grammar and spelling errors, and half of it would be in Spanish.<br/>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-93764" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I know this may sound a bit OT, but &hellip;as far as I&rsquo;ve noticed, two great western literary traditions: English-language &amp; French-language are, in a way, &#8220;national&#8221; to the core, i.e. they are mostly focused on their language-culture authors, ideas, conventions, styles, &hellip; German-language &amp; Russian language traditions are more &#8220;international&#8221;- maybe because they happened to be, re imaginative literature, latecomers. As far as Italians and Spaniards are concerned, they&rsquo;ve had a strange history of early rise &amp; precipitous fall, so it&rsquo;s hard to draw far-reaching conclusions.</p>
<p>Back to Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s thesis.</p>
<p>Is there anything that is so specifically White (European) that average persons of other races simply find it either boring or incomprehensible ? For me- and I grew up reading mostly Russian, German and some French authors, much less British &amp; American- Trollope is quintessentially Victorian British- WASP, if you like. Of course- he IS White. But of a particular cultural ethnic background.</p>
<p>So- are there universal White writers who are virtually irrelevant to Blacks or Hispanics, but are generally accepted or cherished by wide White world, far across national boundaries ?<br/>
Or not ?</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-93784" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;And this, of course, is one of the reasons why curricula are changing. Hispanics and blacks do not see the point of reading Tolstoy or studying Italian, and as their share of the population increases, colleges and high schools will give up trying even to get whites to do these things. And some unfortunate whites who have been taught to think that Alice Walker and Rigoberta Menchu are great writers will never discover what great writing really is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look for the cancellation of gifted programs that were &#8220;too White&#8221; to be the analogy for the cancellation of all goodness in Western civilization.  </p>
<p>Thinking about the future is a dismal prospect for White Awarians.  We know that pure numbers will overwhelm us, that those of us left will be so demoralized that high thoughts and desires will be such a rarity as to make no difference at all to the shrunken White community. And what difference do them make now, other than to closed and shrinking intellectual communities? </p>
<p>So what to do? What to strive for? What to leave behind? And most dismal, for whom to leave anything behind? Will they be worthy of it? Will they stay pure, or will the succumb and race mix just as readily as everyone else will?</p>
<p>Can you see the future where White girls who don&rsquo; have black boyfriends will suffer the worst imaginable torments and attacks for being &#8220;racists&#8221;?  Already, heteros who publically voice opposition to homo marriage are excoriated.  Even I fear speaking out because I&rsquo;m intimidated by the gay mob&rsquo;s potential to ruin my life.  We are suffering under a tyranny of the minority and the pervs, and nobody is coming to our rescue.  </p>
<p>But God is merciful, and veangeful.  He won&rsquo;t allow our genocide without giving us the pleasure of seeing those who did this to us suffer from our marginalization, minoritization, and mongrelization.  When White are forced to cower in survival mode, they won&rsquo;t sustain the institutional vigor required to support the Diversity Scam.   </p>
<p>All our institutions will shrink, because donors will stop giving at the same time not enough paying Whites will show up. The vast state and federal debt and unfunded liabilities will cause such a permanent recession, that grow disappears.</p>
<p>The final step will be massive taxes and confiscation, but even that crashes, because the elites don&rsquo;t want your house, they want their cut of your income.  When the income is gone, all they can do is print money, but that becomes worthless.  The a strong man massacres them all, and takes over, devalues, and rebuilds.  But in a minority White nation, he won&rsquo;t build, he&rsquo;ll just enslave.</p>
<p>The only obstacle is the vast ownership of firearms. Look for Obama in 2013 to go full draconian on your last right that can save your life.</p>

NRA has been derided as fear-mongering, but Obama is certainly no friend of the Second Amendment. Consider:</p>
<p>When he was an Illinois state senator, he voted against a bill that would have shielded homeowners who use deadly force inside their homes, for self-defense, from being prosecuted.</p>
<p>He appointed the notoriously anti-gun justices Sotomayor and Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>He repeated the Mexican and media lie that 90% of the guns the Mexican drug cartels used that were traced by Mexican federales came from the U.S. Only after Operation Fast and Furious blew up in his face, did he stop.</p>
<p>He has assured Sarah Brady, that he&rsquo;s working &#8220;under the radar&#8221; on gun-control schemes.</p>
<p>He made CA, AZ, NM and TX gun dealers keep registration lists, a de facto firearms registry, which is against the law.</p>
<p>The same people who keep telling us that &#8220;Obama doesn&rsquo;t want your guns&#8221;, are the same people who told us the government would never confiscate guns - that was before Hurricane Katrina blew into New Orleans in 2005, and the Bantu mayor there, Ray Nagin, did just that.</p>
<p>May we live in interesting times.</p>

<p>In 1950, there was no Vietnam or Watergate, no &rsquo;energy crisis&rsquo;, Cuban missile crisis, or Iranian hostage crisis. </p>
<p>Every year, every minute, every day, we have more current events and history to learn and process. How can we process an ever increasing amount of information while our very life spans remain relatively the same? We may add another one or two years every decade but how long can we expect that to continue? Even so, a year or two can&rsquo;t allow our brains to store and process decades of current events which make their way into history.</p>
<p>I sometimes feel sorry for kids today. They have to learn not only the history I learned but also the 30 or 40 years of history that I experienced as current events.</p>
<p>Every year there are more novels and books on history. How do we sort through them to know which ones are or will be relevant?   </p>
<p>Do we say, &#8216;only books which were considered classics in 1950 should be the core of our education cannon&rsquo;?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the answer but I do know I&rsquo;m having a problem with information overload. </p>
<p>Our lives are limited. The history we need to know is, for all practical purposes, infinite and expanding just like the universe itself.      </p>

Thank you for all you do.  You can soon see artistic effects of your political and social reading.<br/>
Your despair over modern literature and art is understandable, but despair not.  A new generation of youth is coming, which wikl focus on true technique and fundamentals.  No, I cannot edit here, as I am on a small device.<br/>
The creation of facebook, and the propensity to crunch words created by texting will cause a silent youth rebellion against thr idea that nothing matters, and that aimless verbosity is acceptable.</p>
<p>Postmodernism is dead.<br/>
You hope for a New Rennaissance springing in thr midst of the dark, and that shall come.  </p>

Seriously, Jared, you feel compelled to make a distinction about the books Whites are likely to read, versus what? Blacks seldom read books. What do I base this statement on? Do I have statistics to back it up? Nope.  However, I have never seen a Black in my local library perusing anything other than the movie DVDs. I have never seen a Black in my local bookstore. Hell,  I have never seen a Black in my neighborhood used book shop. Jared,  you seriously think reading  Antony Trollope is quintessentially White?  I say reading a book by anyone  is quintessentially white.</p>

Maybe better question would be: are middle-class Black young adults capable of enjoying classics ? And- which ones ?</p>
<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t think this is simply a &#8220;racial&#8221; question. It has more to do with national identities &amp; cultures. For instance, the best 20th century German novels &amp; memoirs (Musil, Mann, Broch, Canetti, Grass, Rilke, Hesse- his serious work) are books crammed with philosophy in not less than 600-700 pages. I doubt most Americans of any color would be capable of coping with these Behemoths.</p>
<p>IMO, a smaller fraction of middle-class Blacks can enjoy &amp; appreciate anything others (not only Whites) have written, but they are in significantly smaller percentage than White or Asian children-young adults.</p>

<p>What do you consider Hesse&rsquo;s serious work? <br/>
I read &#8220;Damien&#8221; as a young adult, which leads to an unhealthy gnostic, messianic impulse. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demian" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demian</a>)<br/>
Does the theology of Hesse ever escape to to more traditional grounds?</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading Hesse, but I find increasingly that I cannot deal with books coated in immature philosophy, untenable in maturity.</p>
<p>Have you encountered this problem of great works coated in questionable philosophy?<br/>
I see you only now read non-fiction, I have also begun to depart this way, due to this clash of philosophy.  In fiction the stimuli pre-chosen for you can impart ideologies.</p>
<p>I call the tendrils of illogic, planted and growing in the brain.  </p>

I&rsquo;m not in the lest disturbed by author&rsquo;s &#8220;philosophy&#8221;, if I disagree with it. Hesse&rsquo;s great works are, IMO, Steppenwolf, Demian, Narcissus and Goldmund and The Glass Bead Game. It&rsquo;s the amount of life lived &amp; breadth &amp; depth of ideas discussed that makes great works- great.</p>
<p>As far as Gnosticism is concerned- I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unhealthy or immature. It is the vital element in major works of William Blake or Walt Whitman or Herman Melville. </p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m too relaxed about it, but I&rsquo;d subscribe to the idea that a man should be both Epicurean and Stoic, skeptic &amp; believer, hedonist &amp; ascetic&hellip;and go on with his life.</p>

<p>I share your unease with the &#8220;unmoooring&#8221; of the educational and literary foundation from from its Western European roots.  But tell me if  it ts  true.   Didn&rsquo;t it seem that non-White literary figures in the 50s through the 70s produced works that were more influenced by the traditional Western canon than today?</p>
<p>Reading James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker( have to disagree with you on that one!),  Ernest Gaines, etc.   Their work bears the influences of the great Western writers of the past especially when I read Southern lit written in a certain erfa by non-Whites.  It just seems light-years ahead  of what passes for &#8220;afro-Americcan&#8221; literature in bookstores these days. </p>

Until early 1900s, USA has been mostly WASP &amp; her literary culture derived (and transformed) from the British. After WW1 and later, many other &#8220;ethnics&#8221; came to prominent positions as writers (mostly Jews), and even WASPs like Faulkner and others identified themselves more with broader European modernism than with &#8220;genteel&#8221; Anglophile tradition. </p>
<p>For Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Norman Mailer, William Faulkner, John Dos Passos, ..now Don DeLillo or Thomas Pynchon- relevant authors are Kafka, Dostoevsky, Mann, Conrad, Nietzsche (literary philosophy), Joyce, Nabokov, .. while Trollope, or even Thackeray and Dickens belong to some distant past hardly anyone is very excited about.</p>

However, as someone pointed out above, he limits himself to &#8220;the black experience,&#8221; with which he is obsessed. I suppose you could say that Trollope limits himself to the white experience, but he writes from an understanding of human nature, and with a genius for plot that Baldwin lacked.</p>

<p>a) about 80-90% of writers &amp; critics &amp; literary historians agree on the relative worth of canonical authors</p>
<p>b) but- it does not oblige any particular reader who enjoys or is bored by various eminent authors. Personally, I think that, say, Nabokov, Bulgakov, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Camus, Sartre, Dickens, Austen, Ibsen, Pushkin, Borges, Brecht  &hellip; are overrated; Martin Du Gard, Leonid Leonov, Thomas Wolfe, Vasily Grossman, D.H. Lawrence, Strindberg, Hamsun, Verga, Broch..are underrated.</p>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>

 Reading-  especially &#8220;deep reading&#8221; of worthy texts - helps build density of<br/>
crucial brain neurons (there are studies about it). In short, it enhances intelligence &amp; broadens imagination.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TVing dumbs everyone down, somewhere to the IQ of a rhinoceros.      </p>
<p>Most males stop reading fiction when they&rsquo;re 30-35 (I did), but females<br/>
read it all along. I haven&rsquo;t read a novel in past 5 or so years, but have read tons of books on politics, science, religion, history, warfare, psychology, philosophy, arts, biographies, theology,<br/>
futurology, &hellip;.</p>
<p>Looks like others have taken notice of this phenomenon:</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-94080" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is an excellent article and it makes a very important point. Only whites are likely to appreciate Trollope, Dickens, Hardy, Eliot, the Brontes, Austen, or Galsworthy. But they are all great writers and well worth reading. To exclude any of them from the curriculum is a crime against us and our posterity, and yet that is one of the consequences of multiculturalism that we&rsquo;ve already seen.</p>
<p>I recently read &#8220;Can You Forgive Her?&#8221; and was pleasantly surprised. I&rsquo;d always heard that Trollope was an inferior writer, but I thought that book was in a class with Hardy&rsquo;s &#8220;The Mayor of Casterbridge&#8221; and Eliot&rsquo;s &#8220;Middlemarch.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I read 19th-century English literature I sometimes feel like an anthropologist studying the mating rituals of the English gentry. I love it. But appreciating it is a little like enjoying good coffee or fine wine: it requires experience and some background knowledge. The stories unfold at a human pace, the pace of people who spent their lives walking or being drawn by horses.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly intrigued by Signora Neroni. What a fascinating character. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to read &#8220;Barchester Towers&#8221; now.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-94125" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>rabota is a tedious work in Old Church Slavic in some parts of Church Slavic canonical corpus. In my native country, Church Slavic texts from 12th-14th century did not use this meaning, which does have initial root from &#8220;slave&#8221;- rab, contemporary Russian&#8221;rjab&#8221;, Croatian and Serbian &#8220;rob&#8221;.<br/>
But, &#8220;rabota&#8221; has very early in all spoken Slavic languages- say, from 14th century or so- lost its meaning of tedious work &amp; became equal to &#8220;work&#8221;. You can see this, by the way, in the explanation of the word &#8220;robot&#8221;:<br/>

I&rsquo;d end this with two points.</p>
<p>1. someone- StivD ?- has pointed that good Black fiction was too narrow, only about Black &#8220;experience&#8221;. This may be true. I&rsquo;d just remark- very greatest fictions were written about provincial subjects (say, Joyce and Faulkner are regional writers), but nevertheless they succeeded to achieve universality. I would add Isaac Bashevis Singer who wrote about Ashkenazi Jews in Yiddish, but is still a great writer, capable of conveying universal truths beyond &#8220;yiddishness&#8221;. This goes, without question, for great Hispanic fictionists (Borges, Garcia Marquez, Carpentier, Asturias, Cortazar, Vargas Llosa,..).<br/>
As far as Black American writers are concerned- I&rsquo;m not sure.  </p>
<p>2. we all know about top 100 lists etc. I would post a few links on greatest works of imaginative literature-one originating from Norway, which is so far the most &#8220;objective&#8221; list of such works. Others are clearly too language-culture bent (which is perfectly normal). Be as it may, not bad for a literary topic:</p>
