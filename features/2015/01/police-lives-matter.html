<p>The deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner have prompted a huge &ldquo;black lives matter&rdquo; movement. There have now been hundreds of demonstrations, protests, and &ldquo;die-ins&rdquo; all over the country to promote the idea that white policemen kill innocent blacks with impunity. Protestors have blocked traffic and been deliberately disruptive. As one spokesman <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/12/us/nationwide-police-protests/">explained</a>, &#8220;Since the &#8216;normal routine&rsquo; of America has always included murder of black and Latino people by law enforcement, this week, that &#8216;normal routine&rsquo; must be disrupted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black magazine <em>Essence</em> has devoted its <a href="http://colorlines.com/archives/2015/01/essence_magazine_devotes_entire_issue_to_black_lives_matter.html">entire February issue</a> to &ldquo;black lives matter.&rdquo; There has been be a <a href="http://www.blacklifemattersconference.com/">Black Life Matters conference</a> at the University of Arizona from January 15 through 17, with sessions on &ldquo;Global Blackness,&rdquo; &ldquo;Criminalizing Black Lives,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Black Sexualities.&rdquo; The movement has even spawned a bizarre offshoot in which blacks &ldquo;invade white spaces&rdquo; by walking into <a href="http://pando.com/2015/01/05/black-lives-matter-but-brunch-is-just-fucking-eggs/">restaurants serving brunch</a> and yelling the names of blacks who have been killed by the police. Brunch is apparently a form of white privilege.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BlackLivesMatter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-112731" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BlackLivesMatter.jpg" alt="Black Lives Matter" width="550" height="413"/></a></p>
<p>As anyone who looked into the facts knows, grand juries <a href="/">refused to indict</a> the officers in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner because the police behaved lawfully and professionally, but facts make no difference to the protestors. But just how many blacks do the police kill every year? Is there any statistical evidence that black lives don&rsquo;t matter to them?</p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../xls/expanded_homicide_data_table_14_justifiable_homicide_by_weapon_law_enforcement_2008-2012.xls">FBI</a>, between 2008 and 2012, police killed an average of slightly over 400 Americans every year, of which 24 percent were black. Not every police force reports its killings to the FBI, and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/hundreds-of-police-killings-are-uncounted-in-federal-statistics-1417577504">independent analysts</a> think the actual number is 800 to even 1,000, but there is <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/kent-osband-what-statistics-say-about-policing-america-1420411320">no reason</a> to think that the racial percentages are different from those reported by the FBI.</p>
<p>Since blacks are only 13 percent of the population, if they account for 24 percent of the people killed by police, it means they are slightly more than twice as likely as non-blacks to die at the hands of the police (see below for how this is calculated). Is this proof of bias that justifies the &ldquo;black lives matter&rdquo; movement?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at violence that goes the other way. <a href="../../../about-us/cjis/ucr/leoka/2013/tables/table_44_leos_fk_race_and_sex_of_known_offender_2004-2013.xls">According to the FBI</a>, during the 10 years from 2004 to 2013, a total of 565 Americans &ldquo;feloniously killed&rdquo; police officers. Forty-threeÂ percent of the killers were black. Last year, the year Michael Brown and Eric Garner were hailed as martyrs, was typical. A survey by co-author Jeff Lipkes found that, in 2014, blacks killed 40 percent of the 47 cops who were murdered on the job. Given their percentage of the population, this means blacks were <em>five times more likely</em> than non-blacks to kill a policeman.</p>
<p>Black violence against cops is perfectly in line with black violence as a whole. For the last year for which <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/43tabledatadecoverviewpdf">arrest records by race</a> are available-2012-blacks accounted for 49.4 percent of arrests for murder, 32.5 percent for rape, 54.9 percent for robbery, and 30.8 percent for burglary. Blacks were therefore more likely than non-blacks to be arrested for all these crimes: from a high of eight times more likely for robbery to a low of three times more likely for burglary.</p>
<p>Liberals try to explain these disproportions by claiming that the police are biased; presumably liberals think police arrest innocent blacks and let guilty whites go. However, a massive annual Department of Justice survey of crime victims finds that the racial breakdown of arrests <a href="../../../archives/reports/the-color-of-crime.html">almost perfectly matches</a> the racial breakdown of reported perpetrators. Victims report that over half the people who mugged them are black-and over half the people arrested for muggings are black. Arrest figures reflect differences in crime rates, not police bias.</p>
<p>Given such high rates black violence, the data suggest that police are shooting far <em>fewer</em> blacks than one would expect. If blacks are five times more likely than other Americans to kill police officers and are approximately four or five times more likely to commit violent crime in general, it would not be surprising if police were four or five times more likely to kill blacks than people of other races-but blacks are only twice as likely to be killed by police. There is nothing remotely resembling the mass murder of blacks that the &ldquo;black lives matter&rdquo; movement takes for granted. When <a href="/news/2015/01/whats-wrong-with-all-lives-matter.html">Prof. Judith Butler</a> of U.C. Berkeley says blacks are &ldquo;targeted and hunted&rdquo; by police as part of a &ldquo;race war&rdquo; she is talking dangerous nonsense.</p>
<p>Far from &ldquo;targeting and hunting blacks,&rdquo; every police officer knows that a violent encounter with a black could blow up into a scandal that ends his career. Many officers are therefore <a href="/">especially hesitant</a> to shoot a black, and after they have shot someone whose race was not clear, they are relieved to learn he was white and not black.</p>
<p>Given the strikingly violent behavior of blacks, there is every reason for police to be cautious around them. Cops are not appreciated in the &lsquo;hood, and an officer can never be sure that a routine traffic stop will be routine if the driver is a black man.</p>
<p>This 2013 <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2443721/Troopers-dashcam-captures-dramatic-moment-father-taking-kids-road-trip-shoots-officer-returns-kills-him.html">article</a> includes a video of a black man who was driving over the limit with three children in the car. When a white officer stopped him for speeding he got out of the car and opened fire.</p>
<p>Here are some typical cases from 2014 of white officers killed in the line of duty by blacks.</p>
<p>Rochester Police Office Daryl Pierson was shot and killed by a suspect who was fleeing on foot after a traffic stop. The 32-year-old officer left behind a wife and two small children.</p>
<p><a href="http://theadvocate.com/news/police/9542394-123/off-duty-vermilion-sheriffs-deputy-shot">Allen Bares</a>, an off-duty Louisiana officer, was mowing his lawn when he saw two young blacks drive a stolen Lexus into a ditch. He walked up to the men and identified himself as a police officer. They fatally shot him, stole his truck, and drove away.</p>
<p>Alexander Thalmann of New Bern, North Carolina, approached a man who was behaving suspiciously. The man ran away, pulled out a handgun, and killed Thalmann, who was 22 years old and had been on the force for only seven months.</p>
<p>Indianapolis police officer Perry Renn was killed when he responded to a 911 call about a man firing a rifle. The killer&rsquo;s family blamed Renn for his own death, saying that he wouldn&rsquo;t have been shot if he had just stayed in his car.</p>
<div id="attachment_112732" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PerryRenn.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-112732" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PerryRenn.jpg" alt="Girl offers her teddy bear to pay respects for " width="550" height="413"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Girl gives away her teddy bear in memory ofÂ Perry Renn.</p></div>
<p>Rookie officer <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/07/13/cop-shot-dead-trying-to-stop-armed-robbery-at-walgreens/">Melvin Santiago</a> of Jersey City also died answering a 911 call, when a black who had stabbed a Walgreen&rsquo;s security guard and stolen his gun shot Santiago as he was getting out of his patrol car.</p>
<p>In Gary, Indiana, <a href="http://abc7chicago.com/news/man-charged-in-gary-cop-jeffrey-westerfield-killing/216557/">Jeffrey Westerfield</a> responded to a domestic violence call and was still in his patrol car with the engine running when a black man walked up to the car and killed him. It was the officer&rsquo;s 47th birthday, and he left behind four daughters.</p>
<p>Office Jair Cabrera was ambushed by a member of the Phoenix East Side Bloods when he was lured into making a 3:00 a.m. traffic stop.</p>
<p>Another officer may have been the victim of the knockout game. Robert White, a 45-year-old El Paso County constable, was working as a security guard at a Halloween event when he was sucker-punched by a 19-year-old black. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.</p>
<div id="attachment_112733" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RobertWhite.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-112733" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RobertWhite.jpg" alt="Robert White" width="550" height="417"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Robert White</p></div>
<p><a href="http://fox8.com/2014/11/17/police-officer-shot-and-killed-trying-to-protect-others-inside-bar/">Justin Winebrenner</a>, of the Akron Police Department, was in a bar when an unruly patron got into an argument with the bouncer. Winebrenner was fatally shot when he tried to help get the man out of the bar. The black patron shot four others but did not kill them.</p>
<p>In Tarpon Springs, Florida, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/killed-florida-suspect-custody-article-1.2052468">Charlie Kondek</a> was shot and killed when he answered a call about a black man blasting music from his car and pounding on doors. Kondek left behind six children.</p>
<p>You have never heard any of these names. Unlike the black criminals Eric Garner and Michael Brown, who have become world famous, they were simply white police officers doing their jobs. There is no movement to protest their deaths.</p>
<p>Can it be a surprise that police officers <a href="/">all around the country</a> are furious at government officials, from the president on down, who clearly care more about blacks who died because they committed crimes than about officers who were murdered trying to stop crimes?</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DumpDeBlasio.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-112734" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DumpDeBlasio.jpg" alt="DumpDeBlasio" width="550" height="310"/></a></p>
<p>This situation cannot last. If it does, responsible whites will leave the profession, and we will be left with white thugs and affirmative-action hires. America will long for the days of officers like Darren Wilson and Daniel Pantaleo.</p>
<hr>
<p>*Blacks are thirteen percent of the population, but account for 24 percent of all killings by police. Everyone else accounts for 76 percent. To get the relative rate at which blacks are killed by police, divide 24 by 13, to get 1.846. To get the relative rate at which non-blacks are killed by the police, divide (100 - 24) by (100 - 13), or 76 by 87 to get 0.874. The multiple of the black vs. non-black rate is 1.846/0.874 = 2.1.</p>

As a rule of thumb, women are more into relationships.  Maintaining one of these can be difficult for a self-absorbed &#8220;yoof&#8221;.  How many of them love working at their mothers&rsquo; homes?  I do, and make replacement parts for things there.  The last was only a mounting bracket for a screen door.  Mine was twice as thick as the original part, and stainless, from scrap metal I had scrounged; I made a paper template from the original.  I have taken up her father&rsquo;s mantle in this respect, as he has been dead for the last 20 years; I miss him very much.  I spent a morning shoveling snow there just after Christmas.</p>
<p>I have been married eight years, and Sayaka has also come to expect me to be able to make replacement parts for things.  Even Glenn once exclaimed while he was staying here, &#8220;Jesus Christ, Mike, when you need something you usually just go to the basement and make one.&#8221;</p>
<p>N&rsquo;DeShitavious doesn&rsquo;t do that.  He completely lacks the sense of responsibility as well as a level of intelligence remotely up to the task.</p>

Back when the Occupy movement was in full swing, I noted on here that when they were cleared out of a city park, bags of groceries were left behind.  Inside those bags were receipts showing that SEIU had paid for the Occupier&rsquo;s food.  SEIU also helped organize both of these events and handled the logistics.  The National Lawyer&rsquo;s Guild offered their services pro-bono to any protesters that were arrested.  ACLU attorney&rsquo;s were on hand, walking amongst the protesters, to monitor police responses.<br/>
When SEIU was protesting in my city and snarling traffic, attorneys for the ACLU were there as well, as was the offers of pro-bono representation from the National Lawyer&rsquo;s Guild.<br/>
It&rsquo;s always the same small group of players. The problem is their pockets are deep.  Open Society Network, SEIU, ACLU, SPLC, ADL, National Lawyer&rsquo;s Guild, (the former) ACORN.  They all have each other on speed dial, coordinating their efforts to break down &#8220;the system&#8221;.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-696612" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>True, and you make a valid point. The vast majority of cops, however, are NOT abusing nor looking to abuse whites and conservatives. </p>
<p>And while it&rsquo;s true that these same cops show up at protests and marches, they are not there to target whites or conservatives, but to keep the general order knowing full well that both political groups would be at each other&rsquo;s throats if no police presence were there.</p>
<p>Some whites and conservative protesters have, at times, been guilty of provoking and antagonizing the police. I&rsquo;ve met some in my career who while in the right politically, were quite hostile and unreasonable. </p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s not the average cop who works the streets who labels patriot or conservative groups as &#8220;terrorists,&#8221; but law enforcement administrations based on what they are told by such groups as SPLC.</p>

If they had a problem with Conservative groups being labeled terrorist by their masters then they should walk away. No matter how they feel personally the average cop is still the enforcer of Multi-Cult laws being handed down.</p>
<p>Just following orders and needing to make a living might be enough of an excuse to keep many from outright condemning them but it ain&rsquo;t enough of one to get us out supporting them either.</p>
<p>It might be best to treat this as a fork in the road. Law enforcement in general needs to start deciding which fork they are going to follow.</p>

This prompts a further question,  why?</p>
<p>Because there is no MONEY in holding protest marches against gangbangers!  There is no political favor to be gained with liberal politicians in attacking black criminals.   There is, as a corollary,  a bit of physical danger in being a highly visible activist in your neighborhood pushing cops to get the drug dealers out of business.</p>
<p>Conversely,  there is ZERO physical danger in protesting against cops and unprovable intangibles like &#8220;white privilege, &#8221; and plenty of political capital to be had in pushing redistribution from the productive (whites) to the unproductive (blacks.)</p>

<p>Obama and Holder have been very effective in eliminating the White from the ranks of the Federal Government, essencially creating a new black middle class.

<p>With those four pillars in place the table is set. White are ruled over by a black government that serves only black needs, with a black education system to watch Whites and instill guilt and rob them of their heritage, black police to keep any attempts of &#8220;racist&#8221; resistance crushed and a minority filled Army to watch the young aggressive ones that might become leaders of such resistance.</p>

MSM and the race hucksters among other factors have convinced blacks (and many liberal lemmings) that white men are evil and guilty of everything from bad weather to incorrect fast-food orders. Multiculturalism=destruction of Euro culture. So in a crazy land where Maslow&rsquo;s lower stepped behavior is touted as &#8220;cool&#8221; and shiny objects and dry humping the air is normal, blacks expect to have free reign to attack whites anytime  they want to.<br/>
As a sidebar, when those loud mouthed fools started yelling while I was in a restaurant  trying to eat I would cheer and clap every time these racists read a name off their &#8220;death roll.&#8221;  I predict a call to the police would have to quickly follow of course&hellip;.you know.</p>

He was as black as the ace of spades, just turned 18, and in for car theft.  He used to cry at night, in full understanding of what he&rsquo;d done to his future.  Maybe he didn&rsquo;t have one, but he seemed pretty sad, so I cheered him up   I looked up from the chess board and he started laughing.  &#8220;We&rsquo;re all n!&&ers here,&#8221; I explained in a soft, low voice.  He nodded and grinned.  Laundry there was a bucket of water and some soap.</p>

<p>We Americans have allowed ourselves to be dominated by non-productive, criminal minority, which now demands exemption from all of the laws that bind us. Our country is not redeemable by normal political processes. At this stage, worse is probably better. When Americans truly understand that Africans threaten their very lives and that there&rsquo;s no point in calling the cops, perhaps they&rsquo;ll take up arms and put a stop to all this foolishness.</p>

<p>It has already happened around here. 99.999% of cops are complete idiots. I am sure I have mentioned it before on this forum. Almost all have a bully attitude. I have only met 3 cops who seemed to be honest, and saw what was happening around them. Strangely one of those 3 cops was a black woman. The other 2 were white men. If I mention the people who are behind it, I am called a Nazi raciss by the Republican right wing whack jobs.</p>
<p> This isn&rsquo;t only with law enforcement. I have the same problems with Doctors and health care.</p>

<p>The thread is old, but I&rsquo;m sure I read 90% of it at the time. Regardless, I&rsquo;m familiar with the tone of AmRen comments. I agree with some, and not with others.</p>
<blockquote><p>and not sure who the &#8220;we&#8221; is referring to when you say &#8220;we recognize.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Um. Okay, would you like to list a culture - ANY culture - prior to 1960 which you would consider both &#8220;civilized&#8221; and not racist?</p>
<p>If you consider NOTHING but the Western world post-1965 &#8220;civilized,&#8221; you are going to have to justify that.</p>
<blockquote><p>Alternative viewpoint hahahaha wow yes, that&rsquo;s a good pc spin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s precisely what it is. Actually, I should have said viewPOINTS, because there&rsquo;s no one monolithic opinion here on race relations or how we should all live. </p>
<p>The knee-jerk characterization of sites like this as [whatever you want to call it - &#8220;neo-Nazi,&#8221; &#8220;white supremacist,&#8221; etc.] ALSO silences more moderate dialogue that even the likes of liberals ought to consider valuable. </p>
<p>Prof. Carol Swain has expressed the concern that it is folly to write off white nationalists without consideration, because the movement has grown out of racial tensions that are not being fully addressed in Western society. It fell on deaf ears, of course, with her being called, &#8220;an apologist for white supremacists,&#8221; even though she clearly disagrees strongly with white nationalism.</p>
<p>People like you are essentially doing the same thing as the people who attacked Prof. Swain without listening to what she was saying.</p>
