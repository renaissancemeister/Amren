<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Bill Warner, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mohammed-Unbelievers-political-Islamic-trilogy/dp/097855289X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420732362&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Mohammed+and+the+Unbelievers">Mohammed and the Unbelievers</a>, CSPI Publishing, 2006, 172 pp., $17.95 (softcover).</em></strong></p>
<p>In his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-100-Ranking-Influential-Persons/dp/0806513500"><em>The 100</em></a>, Michael H. Hart profiles the 100 people he thinks had the greatest impact on world history. He ranks the prophet Mohammed number one.</p>
<p><em>Mohammed and the Unbelievers </em>is very critical both of Mohammed and of Islam, but its author, Bill Warner, would probably agree with Prof. Hart. It is hard to think of anyone who, single-handedly, so dramatically changed the lives of so many people. Dr. Warner believes that it is essential for non-Muslims to understand Islam, and <em>Mohammed and the Unbelievers</em> is the first of a <a href="http://www.politicalislam.com/product-category/paperbacks/">series of books</a> he has written to explain the religion&rsquo;s true nature to Westerners.</p>
<p>Because Mohammed lived in an obscure corner of the world, we have only Arab accounts of his life, and the only sources of information are the three holy books of Islam. The best known is the Koran, of course, but there are two other sacred texts that, together, contain six times as much material as the Koran: the Sira, which is a set of biographies of Mohammed, and the Hadith, which is a compilation of the prophet&rsquo;s works and teachings. For all we know, these books could be fairy tales, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter; what is important is that Muslims believe them.</p>
<p>All three books are hard going. They are filled with genealogies, poetry, and other fluff that do not tell us much about Mohammed or Islam. Dr. Warner has boiled this mass down to its essentials to give us a concise, readable life of the prophet and the founding of Islam.</p>
<p><strong>From Mecca to Medina</strong></p>
<p>Mohammed was born in approximately 570 AD in Mecca, which was one of the wealthiest cities in Arabia. At that time, Arabs were polytheists, and one of their principal gods, a moon god, was already called Allah. Mohammed&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name was Abdullah, which means &ldquo;slave of Allah,&rdquo; and it was common to pray to Allah. The people of Mecca already revered the Kabah-the square black structure in Mecca-which they believed had been built by Abraham.</p>
<p>Mohammed was a trader who had married a wealthy widow, and he lived an ordinary life until middle age. Suddenly, at about age 40, he began to have visions, and wrote the Koran-which means &ldquo;recitation&rdquo;-under instruction from the angel Gabriel. Part of the Koran is a retelling of Old Testament stories, and Mohammed clearly got this information from the small population of Jews and Christians who lived in Mecca.</p>
<p>For three years, Mohammed revealed his new teachings only to a few intimates and to his wife, who became his first convert. Mohammed&rsquo;s principle new idea was monotheism, but he was not the first Arab to promote it. A Meccan named Zayd had preached monotheism, and Mohammed recognized him as a precursor.</p>
<p>Mecca was religiously tolerant, and no one cared if Mohammed wanted to be a monotheist, but when he began to speak openly he made a pest of himself by insisting that everyone else was wrong. Skeptics asked Mohammed to prove his powers by performing miracles, but Mohammed refused, claiming that he was only Allah&rsquo;s messenger not Allah himself. Meccans repeatedly proposed that people should be left alone to practice whatever religion they liked, but Mohammed indignantly refused, insisting that anyone who didn&rsquo;t follow his teaching would burn in hell. There was constant trouble between his followers and everyone else.</p>
<p>Mohammed had more success on a visit to Medina, which was a ten-day trek to the north. The town was about half Jewish, and the Jews and Arabs did not get along. The Jews kept predicting that a prophet would come and deliver them, and when Mohammed showed up claiming to be a prophet, some of the Arabs decided to get a jump on the Jews by adopting the prophet first, and became Muslims. There were plenty of non-Muslim Arabs still in town, however, so Medina ended up with the same kind of strife as Mecca.</p>
<p>When the Meccans learned that Mohammed had allies in Medina they were afraid of his growing power and decided to kill him, but Mohammed learned of the plot and ran away with his disciples to live in Medina. This was in 622 AD, and the flight to Medina, known as the <em>hegira</em>, is year one on the Muslim calendar.</p>
<p>In Medina, Mohammed worked out many of the details of Islam. His followers built the first mosque, with attached living quarters for the prophet. He established the muezzin&rsquo;s call to prayer as a way to distinguish Muslims from Jews, who blew the shofar to announce prayers, and Christians who rang a bell.</p>
<p>He also developed the theory that the Jews had been Allah&rsquo;s chosen people, and that the Torah had originally predicted his coming. However, the Jews deliberately changed the text to keep Mohammed out of the Torah, and thus turned their back on Allah and lost their special status. The Koran was therefore the true version of the Hebrew scriptures, and Mohammed claimed that he was &ldquo;closer to Moses than they [Jews] are.&rdquo; In Mecca, Muslims had faced Jerusalem when they prayed; after Mohammed rejected the Jews, Muslims faced Mecca. Mohammed also recognized Jesus as a prophet of Allah but said he could not have been Allah&rsquo;s son. Moreover, Jesus was not crucified but taken up directly into heaven while a double died on the cross.</p>
<p>After two years in Medina, during which the number of Mohammed&rsquo;s followers grew from about 150 to 300, the prophet got orders from Allah to make holy war, or jihad, on the Meccans. The Muslims went on a few desert raids but either never found anyone or did little damage. The first serious fight with the Meccans-the Battle of Badr-took place in 624. The Muslims are said to have been outnumbered three to one, but Allah sent angels to join the fight, and Mohammed routed the Meccans. Dr. Warner calls this one of the most important battles in the history of the world, because it immediately established Mohammed as a political as well as religious figure.</p>
<p>The prophet quickly worked out the rules of jihad. He got one fifth of the plunder, and his soldiers shared the rest. Anyone who died fighting the unbelievers-known as Kafirs-went straight into the arms of <em>houris</em>: specially trained nymphomaniac virgins.</p>
<p>Strangely, the next major fight with the Meccans-the Battle of Uhud-was a defeat; even Mohammed was bloodied in the face and had to leave the field. Where were the angels? The Koran spends 60 verses looking into what went wrong, and explains that this was a test of the courage and commitment of Mohammed and his followers.</p>
<p>In 630, after another series of victories, Mohammed invaded Mecca with an army said to have numbered 10,000 men. By then, he was considered invincible, and he met little resistance. From Mecca, he spread Islam by the sword-Kafirs had the choice of conversion or slaughter-and by the time he died in 632, all of Arabia was Muslim.</p>
<p><strong>Preacher and warrior</strong></p>
<p>As Dr. Warner explains, Mohammed&rsquo;s life had three distinct stages. For about 40 years he was a trader. For the next 14 years, he was a preacher, but attracted only about 300 followers. He became wildly successful only during the last nine years of his life, when he started spreading Islam by violence.</p>
<p>Dr. Warner calculates that during that last period, on average, Mohammed&rsquo;s men were in a battle or on a raid every seven weeks, and that does not include the many assassinations and executions carried out under his orders. It was Mohammed the warrior, not the preacher, who changed the course of history.</p>
<p>The violent struggle to convert Kafirs-jihad-is what gives the Koran its character. Dr. Warner points out that the religious tenets of Islam are not very complicated and do not take up many pages. It is Mohammed&rsquo;s endless battles with the infidels and his rules for dealing with them that are the heart of the Koran. In this sense, the Koran is more about politics than religion.</p>
<p>For centuries, Islam was in a constant state of war with Kafirs, who were to be converted or destroyed. Jews and Christians-the &ldquo;people of the book&rdquo;-had a special status because they believe in Allah, even though their understanding is corrupt and contemptible. They could be tolerated in an Islamic society if they accepted inferior status as <em>dhimmis</em>, which means paying a heavy tax and following humiliating rules. For example, they could not own weapons or ride horses or camels, and when they rode donkeys they had to ride side saddle. They always gave precedence to Muslims, and in a dispute their word counted for nothing against that of a Muslim. <em>Dhimmis</em> could still be enslaved or deported more or less at the whim of the authorities. Sometimes, Kafirs who were not &ldquo;people of the book&rdquo; were granted <em>dhimmi</em> status, but were treated even more harshly.</p>
<p><strong>Jews</strong></p>
<p>There were many Jews in Medina, so Mohammed had much more contact with them than with Christians. There were three tribes of Jews in the city, and Mohammed made war on all of them. He drove out the first two with only the clothes on their backs, and stole their possessions. The third tribe had a fort, which held out against a Muslim siege for 25 days. When the Jews surrendered, the Muslims abducted the children, took the women as sex slaves, and slaughtered the men. Mohammed is said to have watched with approval, his favorite wife by his side, as 600 to 800 Jews were executed.</p>
<p>Some of the Jews Mohammed chased out of Medina went to a town called Khaybar, northeast of Medina, where they became the first <em>dhimmis</em>. They were allowed to stay, and were not forced to convert, but they had to turn over half their crops every year. On his deathbed, Mohammed ordered that all Jews and Christians be expelled from Arabia, so the <em>dhimmi </em>status of the Jews of Khaybar was revoked and they were driven out.</p>
<p>There are a number of stories in the Muslim holy books about individual Jews. One Jew in Medina criticized Mohammed before he was powerful enough to run Jews out of town. This man could not be touched because he lived in a well-guarded, fortified house. Some of Mohammed&rsquo;s pals then claimed to be disenchanted with Islam, and approached the Jew for a loan. They offered to put up weapons as collateral, but this was only an excuse for four or five Muslims to enter his house with arms. They killed him and stole his property. Mohammed&rsquo;s followers assassinated several other Jews through similar trickery.</p>
<p>Jews were not, however, the only people Muslims treated harshly. One of Mohammed&rsquo;s lieutenants, Khalid, besieged a town of Kafir Arabs who eventually surrendered, on the promise that the men would be spared. Khalid massacred them anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Sex</strong></p>
<p>Mohammed was a sex fiend, who had at least 10 wives and countless sex slaves. He married his favorite wife, Aisha, when she was six, and had intercourse with her when she was nine. He let her bring her dolls into the harem, which was a great concession, since he was against images of any kind. Another of his wives, Zaynab, was originally married to Mohammed&rsquo;s adopted son, but he caught sight of her in her underwear, and made his son divorce her so he could have her. It was about this time that Mohammed started making women wear veils, since he didn&rsquo;t want other men getting a good look at his wives.</p>
<p>One of Mohammed&rsquo;s wives was a beautiful Jewess named Safiyya. She had been captured in war after her husband was tortured and killed, and one of the Muslim soldiers made off with her. When Mohammed heard how beautiful she was, he took her from the soldier and told him to find someone else. Since Safiyya was a captive infidel, Mohammed could have simply kept her as a sex slave, but she converted to Islam and he married her, thus giving her the same title-&ldquo;Mother of Believers&rdquo;-as his other wives. After he died, Safiyya became a woman of considerable influence, though other wives were suspicious of her because of her Jewish origins.</p>
<p>Yet another wife famous for her beauty was a Coptic Christian. The other wives were jealous of her fair skin and curly hair.</p>
<p>Besides wives, Mohammed took countless sex slaves from among the women captured from the Kafirs, and he established rules for how to treat captive women. The Koran says they may be raped in front of their husbands, but only if they are not pregnant. Pregnant women must be allowed to give birth before they are raped. Mohammed ordered that all captured men be put to death, but children were to be distributed as slaves and reared as Muslims. Mohammed also forbade mutilation of the dead.</p>
<p>Barbarous as his practices sound today, Mohammed was no different from many other conquerors. In the Old Testament, the Children of Israel sometimes killed every man, woman, child, and animal in the cities they conquered. The Mongols, the Huns, and plenty of Europeans had no compunction about mass murder, either.</p>
<p>What sets Mohammad apart is that he was a ruthless conqueror who <em>also</em> started a religion. People who start great religions don&rsquo;t usually have hands dripping with blood. Abraham, Jesus, Gautama Buddha, Zoroaster, and the Hindu saints could hardly be more different from Mohammed.</p>
<p><strong>Islam today</strong></p>
<p>As Dr. Warner points out, there are plenty of Muslims who still believe and act as Mohammed did. The people fighting for the Islamic State undoubtedly see themselves following in the footsteps of the prophet, observing the Koran to the letter. When its commanders recently handed out rules on <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/13/islamic-sate-hands-out-rules-for-sex-slaves-in-ira/">sex slaves</a>, they were just following Islamic scripture.</p>
<p>After Boko Haram kidnapped hundreds of girls in northern Nigeria last year, its leader <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/05/08/girls-held-by-boko-haram-face-auction-life-as-sex-slaves-if-rescue-fails/">Abubakar Shekau</a> made a video in which he explained that he was selling the girls he wasn&rsquo;t keeping as slaves for his own men. Like the Islamic State, Boko Haram was following Koranic doctrine.</p>
<p>Islam has no separation of church and state; the caliph is the both religious and civil leader, just as Mohammed was. Islam-which means &ldquo;submission&rdquo;-can therefore govern every aspect of one&rsquo;s life, and it appeals to people who want to devote themselves to a greater cause. It may be more attractive than ever in today&rsquo;s era of abundance, in which so many people find no goals in life beyond the satisfaction of personal desires. Its aggressive masculinity also appeals to men who do not like societies that promote equality of the sexes.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons, the only religion that still asks its followers to die for it finds no shortage of martyrs. Various jihadist movements have attracted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_rebel_fighters_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War">thousands of Muslims</a> from all over the world. There may be as many as <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/national/syria_war_graduates_bigger_threat_2hwUer2QZMX4xjPtjdusjM">700 French citizens</a>, for example, now fighting in holy wars. The Islamic State gets the most volunteers these days, no doubt because of its bloodthirsty, back-to-the-Koran authenticity. It beheads its enemies-just as Mohammed did-and videos of these executions are its most effective recruitment tools.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that most Muslims do not make war on the infidel. However, of all the major religions, only Islam is famous for conversion by the sword, and it did so for centuries, across great parts of the world. There are passages in the Koran that forbid aggressive war or conversion by force-and Muslim apologists make much of them-but there are plenty of passages, such as Sura 9, Verse 5, that command death for unbelievers:</p>
<blockquote><p>[S]lay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them captive, and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a story from Islamic scripture that even today captures Islam&rsquo;s nature and its unique appeal. At one point, Mohammed told his followers in Medina, &ldquo;Kill any Jew that falls into your power.&rdquo; Muhayyisa, a good Muslim, then promptly killed his long-time Jewish business partner. Muhayyisa&rsquo;s brother, who was not a Muslim, started beating him for this act of treachery, but Muhayyisa explained that Mohammed had ordered the killing. The brother asked if Muhayyisa would kill his own brother if the prophet told him to, and Muhayyisa said yes, he would. &ldquo;By Allah, any religion that brings you to this is marvelous,&rdquo; said the brother, and immediately converted.</p>

Islam provides a convenient and effective organization for this attack.The Islamic religion also encourages sacrifice and the use of force. Note that during the Crusades, the Roman Catholic church provided similar organization and encouragement. </p>
<p>The actions of the Muslims are normal; the lack of resistance of Western men is hideously abnormal.</p>

They did not mess with the White Christian world when we were proud racial realists who were known for waging brutal warfare against our enemies. If they faced a White Christian United front unafraid to act in swift and decisive self defense, the White Christian world would not be dealing with terrorism issues. We should left Afghanistan a wasteland with a population of zero in September 2001. Not a blade of grass or field mouse remaining. If this was not enough, a couple of other nukes on key Islamic strongholds would have brought the Islamists to their knees. With an Arabophilic Liberal Republican in the White House, though, we we treated to a classic Leftist response. We were told that a bunch of Mulatto jijadists in Iraq love freedom, and our men were sent to die to hand aforesaid Mulatto jihadist scum undeserved and unearned freedom on a silver platter. </p>

Their world view is generally 50 years out of date - yeah Communism and Bolshevism were really bad in the 1920s and 1930s, but by the 1980s, good White Russians were solidly back in power and the Soviet Union, Russia was a good White place. When Russians were fighting these nasty, dark, hairy, raping Jihadist Muslims, I just took the White Russian side. How complicated is that? American Jews take the Jewish Israeli side. No Jewish people in American advocate for war against Jewish people in Israel, why the **** do White Americans, particularly supposedly patriotic, Conservative White Americans advocate for war, slaughter of our kinsmen the Russians? Serbs? Germans? Why is God&rsquo;s name would we support, arm the nastiest brown/Arab/Turk Muslim terrorist? Our people are really stupid, seem to have racial, ethnic common sense. I&rsquo;ve never met a White person from Eastern Europe who was an idiot about race, Muslims - WT* is wrong with our people?</p>

They had no use for brain dead, sociopath Negroes trying to form Africa in our Midst. George Corley Wallace had his largest numbers of votes in the North on Milwaukee&rsquo;s South Side, from Polish and Serbian Americans. They saw what Negroes were doing to the formerly German North side of their city, and refused to allow their neighborhood to fall victim to such a fate. </p>

I was shocked to see a beautiful polish american girl with a black pickanninie next to her. I am assuming that is her daughter from bedding down with a black. Not the child&rsquo;s fault, but the mother should have had more sense to not betray her race by bedding down with a black. Her family looked very nice and wealthy. Sad that their beautiful daughter turned out to be a bad apple.</p>

If Whites had taken the racial realist approach beginning about 50 years ago, with borders to White nations closed to all but fellow Whites, we would not have the ridiculous problems with non-Whites that we presently have. France has permitted Algiers in their midst and Kabul in their midst to be built in their land. Politicians with Leftist, diversity cult ideations have permitted this. When you permit Moroccans and Algerians to settle en masse in your midst, logic dictates that they will perpetuate the cultures they came from. Mulatto Islamism hell pits where men named Abdul and Mohammed channel White girls into sex trafficking rings, and gang rape and polygamy are rampant. Western Europe should have exactly zero Islamists living in their midst, and could have made this the case with the proper leadership. Borders closed to all but fellow Whites. </p>

<p>Yes, certain members of the tribe work to flood what remains of the White West with hordes of murderous, raping Muslims.</p>
<p>The Tribe got kicked out of Spain in 1492 in large part for taking the Muslim Moor side against White Spanish Catholics.</p>
<p>Certain groups of the Tribe have always demanded mass immigration in to the USA, the West (read that cursed poem put on our Statue of Liberty - Give us your huddled masses). At the same time most of the Tribe demands that Israel be a Jewish ethno state.</p>
<p>Israel had problems with third world immigration, so the government of Israel built a very effective border wall.</p>
<p>Can we do the same on our Southern Border? Can White countries like France and Australia do the same?</p>
<p>powerful members of the tribe say &#8220;No&#8221; - that would be RACIST, NAZI, even if we are talking about keeping out the worst Islamic terrorists from Yemen and Syria.</p>
<p>But, it isn&rsquo;t just the Tribe doing this.</p>
<p>Corrupt White Gentile business leaders like Tyson Foods CEO Donnie Smith demand low wage neo slave labor - that&rsquo;s why Tyson Foods has flooded middle Tennessee with Somalian Bantu Muslim workers.</p>
<p>The idiot patriot cowboy here in AZ Cliven Burdy is just as bad.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t blame the tribe for all our terrible immigration problems. There are simply way too many traitors from our people who have mostly gotten away with their treason.</p>
<p>See Lindsey Graham, John McCain, the Kennedy Family, the Bush Family, Ron and Rand Paul etc.</p>

The abnormal lack of desire to defend our race and culture against this alien culture created by an alien sub-race is the problem on our end. When Japan messed with the West, Harry Truman recognized that the driving force behind Japanese hatred of the West was a jealousy of the cultures and accomplishments created by White Europeans. The only way to stop these raving Oriental lunatics was to use atom bombs on them. In the aftermath of 9/11, had the West still had the strong sense of identity we had in 1945, our leaders would have recognized that 9/11 was an act of genocide against the White Christian world, and nuked Afghanistan off of the map. All Western leaders would have stood shoulder to shoulder afterwards with a unified message for Islamic world: Mess with us again, and you will be vaporized. The West could ethnically cleanse the Afro-Arabic Islamists from the map in a few moments if our leaders chose to do so. I say Afro-Arabic, as this is the racial make-up of the Islamists. Generations of miscegenation with harems of Negresses has resulted in a bunch of Mulattoes. The homicidal maniacs who committed mass murder in France have clearly Negroid facial features. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-686963" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Part of Christianity&rsquo;s current problem is that it does nothing to dispel the myths of moral equivalency between the Crusades and the violence Muslims have embraced from the 7th century til today. Far from being an unprovoked act of aggression by Europe against Islam, it was a delayed response to centuries of Muslims&rsquo; aggression, which had gotten worse and worse from the 7th-11th centuries.</p>
<p>Apologists for Islam like to blame Christians for disrupting &#8220;five centuries of peaceful coexistence&#8221; by calling the first Crusade, when in reality Muslims had captured what amounted to two-thirds of Christian lands, and raped, slaughtered, even cricified those who fought back or wouldn&rsquo;t pay the &#8220;unbeliever&#8221; tax and live as a second-class citizen in their own lands. If they were spared death, they still had no religious or personal freedoms once Muslims took over. </p>
<p>The Crusade was called to take BACK Jerusalem, after some lands (Cyprus, Crete, etc.) had already been successfully taken back by Christians earlier. But to a Muslim, any land which ever belonged to Islam, even if it was stolen and occupied by Muslims for a time, will ALWAYS belong to Islam (they&rsquo;re like small selfish children who believe once they&rsquo;ve so much as TOUCHED a certain toy, it will always be THEIRS). </p>
<p>So the Crusades were a long-awaited response to combat the bloody, violent spread of Islam, the subjugation or murder of Christian citizens, the theft of their lands, and the burning of their churches. But the Crusades are always propped-up by folks who try to claim the two religions are similarly violent, when nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>No group or religion has a monopoly on violence, certainly. It just sucks that people who want to justify their Godless life point to THE CRUSADES (gasp) as justification for that &#8220;all religions are the same&#8221; excuse, when that&rsquo;s absolutely not the case, especially when comparing Islam and Christianity.</p>

On the military front, one must note that since the 9-11-2001 attack, it has been western armies invading and subjugating Muslim countries, not visa versa. Indeed, the West&rsquo;s military hegemony is so profound that it is taken for granted when it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>The West&rsquo;s major weaknesses are on the cultural and political fronts, well represented by Europe&rsquo;s non-replacement birth rate among its natives. Which has forced the region&rsquo;s nanny states, in order to survive demographically, to import unassimilable Muslims who are attacking the pillars of Western society from within.</p>

I don&rsquo;t go along fully with what you said. But it is an idea to be kept in mind, definitely, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Probably a very rational and very savvy and cautious approach to try and get people not to fight against each other is best. This is not however what is going on with the politically correct, who I believe are insane and suicidal and are taking us all with them.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-687334" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I agree, the current Feminist/Marxist ideology is perverted and destructive in the extreme. Islam however, among other things, has serious issues with the relations between the sexes. It actually believes if a man and a woman are alone together they will have sex, as the man will not be able to control himself. Paradoxically, Islam agrees with extreme feminism&rsquo;s &#8220;all men are potential rapists&#8221; narrative. The inherited racial traits of the Arabs and Africans reinforce this with their poor impulse control. Muslims really don&rsquo;t have self control&hellip;they have so little faith in their willpower and cognitive abilities that they need rigid societal controls and answers or they cannot function in anything close to a civilized manner.</p>

If Cody Brown can handle four wives, though, more power to him!!! Cody Brown is a good husband to his four wives, a gentleman, and a loving father. Cody&rsquo;s family is an excellent Christian family. I would be honored to call Cody and his wives friend, and to have them as neighbors. They are fine Christian people. To see them raising a nice, massive crop of healthy and happy White youth in this era of low White birthrate is heartening. To see the Browns compared to a homicidal pedophiliac rapist with a harem of sex slaves in beyond disturbing. Warren Jeffs is not the norm amongst Mormons. Most Mormons are embarrassed by him. In the Islamic world, though, Warren Jeffs would be a hero. </p>

No Negroid admixture. Arab Christians also lack the Negroid admixture in their genes. They have been immigrating to America for generations, and are hard working, law abiding White Americans. The Islamist cult is mostly Mulatto racially from generations of miscegenation between Arab slave masters and their Negress sex slaves. </p>

<p>Slaves in the United States were too expensive to be casually mistreated. Immediately prior to the Civil War a young adult slave could cost $1,000. To give an idea of what that was worth, privates in the Union Army during the Civil War were paid $13 a month.</p>

<p>Why do I say this:</p>
<p>Now, look. As long as brown people - and by extention the religion many of them folloow, ie Islam, are confined to their own geographical zone, then obviously and simply they cannot harm us. They will only be a curiosity that exists &#8216;over there&rsquo; and nothing else. This certainly was the case in the pre-1940 USA. I wager that many White Americans of that era had no real knowledge of the existence of such a religion as Islam. Others, more educated Americans probably had a vague notion based on legends, myths and snippets of Hollywood films. Would an American of that era ever have thought of Islam being a threat to himself, his family and his nation?<br/>
And for a moment, don&rsquo;t believe the forces of Islam could, these days, mount a hostile armed invasion of the west. The weaponry that exists in today&rsquo;s technological world, would, in theory, negate that notion.</p>
<p>No. Their ARE forces in today&rsquo;s world that I fear. They are closer to home. Namely the utter, utter, incomprehensible, galactic, stupidity of &#8216;our&rsquo; political class. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re a clueless idiot! Brown Muslim people are not confined to their own geographical zone. There are over 7 million Brown Muslims in France! Pakistani Muslims have set up no go zones for Whites in England, raping over 1,500 White English girls in one town in Yorkshire England! Didn&rsquo;t you read this Amren article? Islam has never respected national boundaries. Islam has always spread by invasion, mass violence, conquest, enslavement - hey clueless, historically ignorant AMURIKUN dumb *&*(, you&rsquo;ve obviously never heard about the sack of Constantinople or the Battle of Algiers. Many of these Brown Muslim countries that you think current brown Muslim hordes will stay in, used to be White Western countries/societies - Algeria was part of the baton of France 60 years ago - large parts of current Turkey were White Greek, Armenian societies - Asia Minor was were the classical city, civilization of Troy was based.</p>
<p>I am afraid there is really not much use in trying to use reason, or teach brutal history lessons of Whites getting slaughtered and enslaved by the Muslims guys like this commenter will just shrug will insist that these Brown Muslims could never harm us, never invade us because we have superior technology.</p>
<p>Hey dumb *((*_)) did the Blacks in Ferguson MO use superior technology, superior military organization to destroy White civilization in Ferguson MO, how about Detroit or Baltimore?</p>
<p>Sometimes I think the renegade wizard Sauraman has put some sleeping spell on patriotic White Amurikuns. </p>
<p>Jared Taylor was raised by missionary parents in Japan. Mr. Taylor knows that there are virtually no/zero Japanese people who would tolerate any Muslim immigration, terrorism in Japan.</p>

Firstly, Muslims are only in White western lands because the politicians invited them in. The ordinary people never wanted them.<br/>
In theory, political action could deport them all, every last one.<br/>
Alas, this would have been possible in 1968 when Enoch Powell made his speech, but it&rsquo;s too late now. The very few White states that have not accepted Muslims should heed the warning band save themselves.</p>
<p>On the question of thermonuclear weapons, anyone with a brain- not you - can realise that these are game changers that have altered the whole course of warfare and hostile invasion for good. The point I was trying to make, and obviously which you do not or cannot understand is that an advanced White nationalist nation state with nuclear weapons would never, ever be in fear of a hostile, armed Muslim invasion. The consequences for the invading nation would be too dire.<br/>
The reason that White Americans allow blacks to walk all over them is simply because White Americans are too cowardly to fight back.<br/>
By &#8216;fighting back&rsquo; I mean physically fighting back and politically fighting back in electing politicians who will actually explicitly defend White interests.<br/>
As long as you - I am not an American - keep acting in that cowardly manner, which I am certain will not change until you have been subjugated into a black/brown bullied minority, nothing will change in your country.</p>

<p>At this moment, these Muslims are sequestered in their hell-holes. They can live, die, starve, rant, pray, kill each other etc as much as they want.

They are fellow Christians. 2) They do not have significant Negroid admixture in their genes.

<p>Arguably the greatest American Renaissance article ever!</p>
<p>And I have always argued for 14 straight years with know it all open borders Libertarian Loons that Mohamed Ata and his nasty Islamic terrorist buddies were allowed to attend flight school in Florida, get Florida drivers licenses, get on airplanes in Boston MA and proceed to slaughter flight crews, crash our airplanes in to office buildings and the Pentagon, slaughter 3,000 plus of our people in our country.</p>
<p>Ron Paul took the 10th anniversary of the 9-11-01 muslim slaughter to lecture GOP debate viewers that WE deserved this attack for insulting Saudi Arabia by stationing US military forces near Muslim holy sites (Saudi Arabia requested US military forces there) and also deserved the 9-11-01 attack for US pro Israel policies that oppressed the Palestinians!</p>
<p>To this day both Ron Paul and his equally loon Libertarian son Rand Paul insist that the Al Qaedda terrorist leader in Yemen (killed by US drone attack) was a full US citizen based on the legal technicality of &#8220;birth right citizenship&#8221;! Folks this is a real no brainer. Regular Whites remaining alive and unsolved on planet earth do not want to be terrorized, tortured, murdered or enslaved by these nasty, hairy, ugly, racially, culturally alien Islamic barbarians following the pedophile rapist Prophet. When you come out strong for our (local) White people and make these Muslim rapists, slavers, terrorists the enemy - YOU WIN.</p>
<p>On the other hand&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Jew obsessed conspiracy kooks will say 1,500 years of appallingly bad relations with Muslims is all a Mossad false flag operation.</p>

<p>Since AR always has a new tune-in factor, there are probably lots of people who don&rsquo;t know what that means.</p>
<p>There is a fashionable fad in both the left and the libertarian right to denounce American drone strikes of &#8220;American citizens.&#8221; Turns out those drone strikes aren&rsquo;t in the United States, they&rsquo;re in Yemen and Shemen and Pakistan and Whackistan and Whereverthehellistan. And the &#8220;American citizens&#8221; so killed aren&rsquo;t white people named Tom Smith, they have names like Mohammed al-Terroristiqua or some such, and their &#8220;American citizenship&#8221; was purely a function of their having been born in the United States as their non-citizen parents from Whereverthehellistan were here at the time teaching some wacko studies class at some school here. And Mohammed al-Terroristiqua was targeted not because he ran a stop sign, but because he was a major organizer of some AQ style Muslim terrorist jihadi network.</p>

There is a difference between saying that our military bases in Saudi Arabia, our sanctions on Iraq, and our one sided support for Israel, justified the attack in the minds of radical Islamists, and saying that those things justified the attack in Ron Paul&rsquo;s own mind. Ron Paul rejects the notion that we were attacked because of our &#8220;freedoms&#8221;, and he was right about that. Al Qaeda does not care about our &#8220;freedoms&#8221;, one way or another. Switzerland is a free as America, but Al Qaeda did not fly planes into any of its buildings.</p>

<p>Algeria was part of the country of France 60 years ago, majority population in Algerian coastal cities was White European - than hundreds of thousands of poor Arab Muslims from the mountains, countryside moved to the city looking for jobs, or just attracted to White cities - it&rsquo;s the same problem we have with poor Mexican and Central American Amer Indian Mestizo peasants flooding in to California, Chicago.</p>
<p>It is a huge mistake to take the line that we can just leave Muslims alone in &#8220;THEIR COUNTRIES&#8221; as they supposedly will not come in to our countries. They can and are flooding in to our countries.</p>

Now, as a nationalist, I am forced to agree with the wishes of the indigenous Algerian Muslim people for self determination and their own ethnic state. I know this might be unpopular here amongst certain quarters, but we cannot let the White nationalist movement be accused of hypocrisy. We must be equitable in our demands and obligations.<br/>
As for the case of Byzantium/Turkey, well that is so far back in the distant past as to have much bearing on our mission today, which is rooted here, now in the present and the future. If we negate the right of the Ottoman Muslim conquest of Asia Minor way back in the 15th century, then others will demand that the European conquest of the American continent be negated.</p>
<p>No. What the WN movement MUST as an imperative do right now, is to demand the right of White European nations to stay White European. There is still, just, a window of perhaps 50 years to do this.<br/>
As a bare minimum we must agitate for and get a total, absolute non negotiable immigration moratorium from black/brown third world nations that is explicitly, unequivocally and unashamedly racially based and racially enforced. We shouldn&rsquo;t give a damn about what anyone thinks of us for doing this.</p>

I shortened my reply as to not take up unwanted space, but your interpretation is not the same as several historic and current Muslim scholars. You are trying to defend what we can watch on first person internet footage going on in the name of Islam today, something you are not decrying.<br/>
Its not that I don&rsquo;t like Muslims (people), I just understand that they have said (daily) that I am their enemy and should perish.<br/>
If I lived in Muslim lands i would face the same horrible fate that Muslims are inflicting as other Christians in the middle east. And if you are not of the type to cut off my head, you would probably approve or just look the other way.</p>
<p> &#8220;An examination of the Kitab al-Jihad (book of jihad) in the Sahih al-Bukhari, or for that matter any of the canonical hadith collections, reveals that the principal meaning of jihad in the hadiths is the use of military force against unbelievers to make Islam victorious and dominant. This is most significant, because Islamic law is based upon the Sunna.<br/>
We also find that military jihad is given very extensive treatment in the Quran, with several suras being named after battle practices, such as The Spoils of War (Q8).&#8221;<br/>
See also Abudullah bin Muhammad bin Hamid, Sheikh of the Sacred Mosque of Mecca, &#8220;The call to Jihad in the Holy Quran&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fight them, til there is no persecuation (fitna);<br/>
and the religion is Allah&rsquo;s;<br/>
then if they give over (i.e. cease their disbelief and opposition to Islam)<br/>
there shall be no enmity save for evildoers.&rsquo; (Q2:190-93)</p>
<p>Several Muslim scholars address how fitna was more grevious then slaying proved to be a significant one. Q2:217 reveals this after an attack on a Meccan caravan. I also don&rsquo;t believe the Q has changed its stance for western civilization?</p>
<p> Ibn Kathir (Tafsir), he equated fitna with what he called &#8220;committing disbelief&rsquo; and associating (polytheism), along side hindering people from following Islam: which is a much greater evil and more disastrous than killing.&#8221; Jihad is the suggested method of dealing with fitna and those whom are responsible for its cause. (i.e. nonbelievers).<br/>
## So its pretty clear eradicating western civilization to stop fitna, and converting or enslaving Christians for the reasons relating to fitna and rejection of Islam, is something that you, assuming you&rsquo;re a Muslim, is something you should admit to. Need we discuss where lying is OK to achieve this goal for you in the name of Islam?<br/>
I am not telling half truths, just little bits at a time, but it is far better to follow a crumb trail then to point the way to a mirage of what Islam is not, a peaceful religion.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-687350" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>My parents came here from India and I have had Muslim friends who are very nice people. I don&rsquo;t hate any race or religion. However, it would be foolish not to recognize the violent roots of Islam. One problem with the West, though, is that the great foundation of Western culture - the freedoms and the Christian religion, among other things, are basically gone. Politicians are total cowards. When the Danish cartoons were published and the Muslims issued death threats, why didn&rsquo;t the Danish politicians come down hard in support of the cartoonists and free speech?<br/>
In America we now have this President who defends &#8220;the prophet of Islam&#8221;. Well, guess what, most Americans are actually Christian who don&rsquo;t recognize him as a prophet! My parents are Hindus, they certainly don&rsquo;t recognize him as such, and neither do atheists, Buddhists, Native Americans, etc. In Paris apparently the Jews are leaving because of Muslim anti-Semitism and in the UK, underage girls were raped and used by a ring of Muslims but because the police feared offending no one persecuted these fiends. But, what about the rights of those girls? Shouldn&rsquo;t the government put the rights of children and young women not to be abused and raped above the rights of Muslims not to be cross-examined?<br/>
When my parents immigrated to the US, they adapted to the majority culture here. My Mom is a friendly person and when she goes shopping during the holiday season she will cheerfully wish people &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; even though Christmas is not her holiday - but she gets that most people here do celebrate it. The US is a great country, it should not be ashamed of its culture. Part of that greatness includes freedom of speech. If Muslims come here, they need to understand that just like Mormons are insulted (by the play &#8220;Book of Mormon&#8221;) and Christians can be offended (by the &#8220;Piss Christ&#8221; exhibit) and the Jews can be upset (by the Last Passion of Christ) so too they have to deal with the fact that in a free society people may insult their prophet and the proper response is not to blow up a building or chop someone&rsquo;s head off.<br/>
I am really pretty upset about the way the West is caving to the Muslim extremists. How bad does it get before they say &#8220;OK, that&rsquo;s enough&#8221;. I have friends who are very non-provocative and not interested in offending anyone, they are publishing the offensive Charlie Hebdo cartoons on their twitter or FB feeds. I&rsquo;ve seen those things, they are crude and ugly, I&rsquo;d never have read that magazine, but after the bombing, I think every newspaper in the West should publish those images. If they are afraid to do it, then they are cowards and the terrorists have won.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-688292" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Interestingly enough, the Founding Fathers welcomed Jews and there have been Christian Arabs in the Michigan area for over a hundred years. Blacks were forcibly brought here, Chinese were imported to work the railroads and Native Americans were already here when whites came. I am lighter skinned than some of my friends from Italy - I have a friend whose grandparents came from Italy to settle in Texas in the 1920s and they had to live in the &#8220;black&#8221; part of town since they were not considered white. And when I lived in New York, most of my friends were Greek and they were also often discriminated against by the &#8220;whites&#8221;. Yet Greece is the cradle of Western civilization. </p>
<p>I totally support your First Amendment rights to say what you like, including being a racist if you want to be a racist. I actually agree that America should not be a hodge-podge but that people need to assimilate to the culture they find here - which is predominantly Western European and Christian. (Saying Western European is more accurate than white, since Russians are white and yet their culture is quite different as anyone who has actually traveled would know.)</p>
<p>For myself, since my parents came here legally and obeyed all the laws to get here, and since I was born here, etc., I am an American. Now, if you want to cut off further immigration, I agree with you, but changing the rules in the middle of the game is the kind of thing I expect leftists to do - they were the ones who wanted to change the electoral college after Al Gore lost to George Bush. </p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve found that many of my friends who have immigrated here end up being more pro-American than people who have been here for generations. I have a few wealthy leftist white friends who have ancestors who arrived on the Mayflower and they are always apologizing for America, etc. They are nice, decent people and I love them but we never discuss politics since they are far left.</p>
<p>I suspect you will repeat your comments again if I post on here again (since you pretty much posted the above verbatim the last time I posted) so this will be my last response. But, again, I 100% support your free speech rights and I also 100% will not personally insult you or decide I want to kill you if you decide you want to insult my religion. 🙂</p>

Of course the Protestants did not like the Roman Catholics and other Euro races did not like the Poles, the italians and other southern and eastern euro races, but that was due to traditional hostilities. Then they found their common Euro bond and became American.<br/>
Your skin may be fair and fairer than some europeans, but you still love DIE-versity, which is a cancer to white civilization, even though you may not want it to be a hodge podge of other races, but when the white race dies out America will die. Look at Zimbabwe and South Africa before and after it was ruled by whites. Same for Haiti.<br/>
Russians are white, but they are still part of the White Euro Culture. The same as your India, which is so diverse, but still they are considered Indians.<br/>
Immigration from India and non white countries should be cut off and white birth rates should increase,.<br/>
Sadly the May flower descendants have been brainwashed by the libs to feel guilty about being white and that is why they are leftisits. Once those leftists are taken care of then none of that white guilt nonsense will be spread around.<br/>
I do not repaeat my comments verbatim, (I hope you know what verbatim means), but the essence remains the same. I do not want to insult you, but I would like to cure you of your brainwashed leftist nonsense.<br/>
I am glad that your parents came here legally, but I wish they left their Hinduism back in india and not come here with pagan Gods. America was a lot better before the libs and white traitors ruined it by opening its doors in 1965 by changing its immigration laws.<br/>
I support your right to free speech as well.</p>

<p>It was irrational to abuse YOU for something the British did. And it&rsquo;s irrational for you to blame ME for what others did to you. It&rsquo;s just like the blacks who say they want to tax YOU to repay them for the unrelated white person who enslaved their ancestors. So they equate a guy whose Polish ancestors came here 80 years ago with a white Southern planter from 200 years back. I am sure you would disagree with that, yet you are doing the same thing.</p>
<p>My personal opinion - let the person who commits the crime pay the penalty for it. I don&rsquo;t believe in group-think, blaming a group of people for the crimes of their ancestors. I don&rsquo;t go around blaming every white person for what some white people did 100 years ago and I would suggest you not blame every East Indian you meet for what some people did to you at some point in time. </p>
<p>I try to treat each individual as an individual, but then again, I&rsquo;ve read John Stuart Mill and others who espouse what I consider a rational philosophy, so I may be an outlier.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-body-692453" class="dsq-comment-body">
<div id="dsq-comment-message-692453" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Out of curiosity, do you read history? There are some interesting documents written in the 1600s by European travelers to India, the New World, etc. One thing that was interesting, when the Europeans first arrived in India, they were impressed with the level of technology there at the time. However, with the Industrial Revolution the British in particular and Europe in general leapfrogged over the rest of the world. </p>
<p>However, in older times, Europe was technically backwards compared to much of Asia. If you read Marco Polo&rsquo;s journals, for example, or the journals of Jesuits who saw Japan while the country still allowed a small level of foreigners in. A variety of ground-breaking innovations and technology actually originated in much of Asia. </p>
<p>Speaking only for India, the concept of zero originated there. The Hindu numeral system is the basis for the Hindu-Arabic numbers used in the West today. The reason it is called &#8220;Hindu Arabic&#8221; is that the Hindus came up with it and the Arabs gave it to everyone they traded with. To understand why this is important - try to do long division using Roman numerals. Having the proper tool (in this case the numeral system) is often critical.</p>
<p>The other interesting thing is that the British practiced their techniques for conquering India first on the Irish - the divide and conquer, etc. They realized that the Indians were too technically advanced at the time to conquer in a direct way - Indians at the time had cannon and guns, etc. It was not like the way the British conquered tribes in Africa where a direct assault worked due to the difference in technology. So the British used feuding rajahs, etc., just as they had used feuding Irish leaders when they conquered Ireland.</p>
<p>From the point of view of morality - if you believe it&rsquo;s wrong to conquer another peoples&rsquo; country, then what the British did in Ireland, India, etc., was wrong. The reason I don&rsquo;t see the British as distinctly evil or whites as more evil than other races, though, is that this is the story of humanity - from the Aztecs to the Mongols to the tribes of Africa, people have done all sorts of awful things. China has recently conquered Tibet, and no one seems to care about that. Genghis Khan and his Mongol horde were probably the most successful conquerors in history and they committed remarkable atrocity. The British, on the other hand, like the Romans, at least built up infrastructure into their conquered territory.</p>
<p>BTW, another thing the British did which I think most decent people would find immoral - the opium trade in China that led to the Opium Wars. The British wanted the fine things China had - the silks, porcelains, tea, etc. The Chinese didn&rsquo;t want anything the British had, except for silver. The British started smuggling opium into China, addicting the Chinese peasants and getting silver in return. The Chinese government tried to stop this opium smuggling which eventually led to the Opium Wars.<br/>
For myself, I think it is immoral to traffic in addictive drugs like opium. I would never do it. But different people have different views of morality and humanity. </p>
<p>The Indians did come out ahead from having the British there in that they got the English language, the railroads, etc. On the other hand, in the 18th century India had the second largest fabric production industry in the world and was, along with China, one of the wealthier countries in the world. I can send you to a link that has estimated GDP for countries through known history to see this. After the British came, they destroyed India&rsquo;s native manufacturing industry in order to build up their own - they wanted to convert India into a colony, so they bought cotton from there, sent it to England to be made into cloth, and sent to markets around the world. </p>
<p>The British also gave India a sensible parliamentary system and actually united the country which had been made up of kingdoms before that. However, the British also replicated in India what they had done in Ireland during the Great Potato Famine, so millions of Indians died of famine, just as millions of Irish had died. And the British were partly responsible for the partition of India which has caused tension since. The British, BTW, were also responsible for the Balfour Declaration that has caused a lot of tension in the Mideast.<br/>
Is India better or worse off thanks to the British? I think it&rsquo;s a mixed bag. </p>
<p>The Americans I think had the right idea in kicking the British out. The Scots may do it next.</p>

Civilizations rise and fall and that is what happened to European civilization. Europe entered the dark ages after the fall of the Roman and Greek empires and that is why Marco Polo was so fascinated with the Oriental civlization.<br/>
I have read that the Indians invented the concept of 0, but however, it was the whites that made the world what it is. I know that Indians claim to have aeroplanes and atom bombs in the old days, and that is just as absurd as negros claiming and teaching in black schools in the 90s that the Africans ruled Egypt and that Cleopatra was a negress. They also claim that they flew in planes over the pyramids and that the evil white man destroyed their wonderful civilization.<br/>
If India was that far advanced, then why is it so backward? I guess you will say due to British imperialism. Maybe so. But now why do they all want white civilization and still want to be educated in White colleges and then harp about colonialism. So you can see the hypocrisy there. If you are so smart then stay in your own countries and develop your own technologies, which are independent of white technology. I guess that is not going to work for you.<br/>
Yes please send me the link. I would like to know more.<br/>
I do admit that India had a grand past, but like all civilizations it fell. There were things in the works that would make it fall anyway like conflicts between Hindus and muslims and also barbaric practicies that kept women and minorities down.<br/>
Basically everyone is greedy (British and Chinese included) and I do admit that there are bad white people, but that aside, whites have their own right to preserve their heritage since they have helped many nations come up. If not for whites, 95% of the world would be in the stone age. It is white people that stupidly do all the charitable works in Africa and Asia and then get spat on. So you see, non whites just want all the good stuff that whites have to offer and then they bite the hand that feeds.<br/>
Just for the record, I would not want to be with bad white people like white trash. So you can see that I do not fully support white people no matter what happens, but it is the good clean cut whites that I support.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do Western Christians do this? On the contrary, Westerners have welcomed us into their lands and allow us to practice our religion unmolested.&#8221;</p>
<p> What is the status of Christians that are in the lands of Islam? That difference is the difference between us, I am happy that you enjoy the freedom that western civilization has brought you. Its too bad that I cannot enjoy that freedom in Muslim lands without fear of death. </p>
<p>&#8220;How could it, when the Quran has no stance on Western civilization to begin with?&#8221;</p>
<p> The Quran has a stance on non Muslim societies and non Muslims, does it not? That is the point of the conversation. I can promise that if I saw a LARGE group of Christians raping, robbing, torturing and killing other people for simply not being Christian, I would at the very least begin stating that I do not support them and what they are doing is wrong. And if that evil was taking place close to home, I would once again risk my life for my beliefs and join others in trying to stop them.</p>
<p> I am sorry for saying you might help or look the other way if my head was getting cut off. Its true I cannot say that you would. But I am being intellectually honest that today and over the last several months, THOUSANDS of Christians have been raped, robed, tortured and killed in middle east lands.<br/>
To be fair though, many thousands of Christians die every year to communists regimes as well.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-689149" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>In Arabic it is usual to precede a noun with the definitive article. In this case &#8216;Allah&rsquo; - Al Lah - simply means &#8216;the god&rsquo; - equivalent to &#8216;god&rsquo; in English. So, I wouldn&rsquo;t assign too much significance to whether or not a &#8216;Moon god&rsquo; was referred to as &#8216;Allah&rsquo; or not. In an age of polytheism some people believed in many gods, some believed only in their own - not much has changed!</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-692585" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I guess you have not seen other paintings where ancient Greeks were protrayed as white. Alexander is sometimes potrayed as blond and in some as a red haired man. I am not saying Aryan means blond and Blue eyed. You are referring to the liberal meaning of that and I guess they go with what Hiter meant. </p>
<p>LOL, I guess you have misunderstood the meaning of Samhain (Wicker man). They did not burn people, but an effigy. So it may behoove you as well to read history,</p>
<p>I never said that indians are dumb, but what i was saying is that your pagan values are not compatible with a white Christian society and also with your views on preserving DIE-versity. It was Christianity that tamed the world, but sadly the liberals have hijacked those teachings and corrupted them. </p>
<p>I do not like reading Thomas Paine and John Locke since that is where all liberal heresies started and then that got dissiminated into the general population, and now we have all the hell we have to go through. </p>
<p>If you want to see what Jard Taylor thinks about whites marrying Indians/hindus, look at the latest Amren entry &#8216;American White Separatist Finds Shared Values with Israel&rsquo;<br/>
He taks about white women making the mistake of marrying a dark skinned Indian. America and the west were alright when it was white. Prior to 1965 America was more than 90% white and now it is dying off dur to mongrelization and Die-versity. I am more interested in keeping America that way, and you Indians that have dual loyalties should move back since you are most comfortable there.<br/>

I also do not believe in whites going into Africa and other non white countries and telling them to live by Western Democratic standards. Those standards only work for western nations and not for non white nations.</p>

Jefferson basically lifted the Declaration of Independence from Locke&rsquo;s Second Treatise (not that it was plagiarism; everyone understood where the ideas came from) and John Stuart Mill basically defined the best type of society we should strive for, but did so by prescribing individual relations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your comments and recommendations are wasted on someone like the person with whom you are conversing. JSM would recommend keeping the conversation going, so I respect you even if you do so, but it <i>is</i> as waste of your time.</p>
