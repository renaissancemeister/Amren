<h1 class="title">The Left Contradicts Itself on Race</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Hubert Collins, American Renaissance, January 26, 2015</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
Its absurd positions cannot be reconciled.</div> 
</div> 



<p>We all know that the Left&rsquo;s views on race lead to laughable contradictions. For example, there is no such thing as race, but rac<em>ism</em> is the scourge of the planet. All groups are interchangeable, but diversity is wonderful because people are different. As I will show, the Left paints itself into another corner on immigration.</p>
<p>The Left starts from the position that the United States is a very, very racist place where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failures on the part of non-whites are the fault of white racism.</li>
<li>Non-whites cannot succeed in the United States because it is intrinsically &ldquo;white supremacist.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Those who question these first two precepts are racists, even if they think they aren&rsquo;t.</li>
</ul>
<p>We find this logic everywhere. When George Zimmerman was found not guilty, a writer for <em>The Guardian</em> published a column titled, &#8220;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/14/open-season-black-boys-verdict">Open season on black boys after a verdict like this</a>,&#8221; in which he wrote, &ldquo;Let it be noted that on this day, Saturday 13 July 2013, it was still deemed legal in the US to chase and then shoot dead an unarmed young black man on his way home from the store because you didn&rsquo;t like the look of him.&rdquo; <em>The Nation</em> published an article called, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/175260/white-supremacy-acquits-george-zimmerman">White Supremacy Acquits George Zimmerman</a>&rdquo; that explained how &ldquo;this verdict is a crystal-clear illustration of the way white supremacy operates in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More recently, <em>Salon</em> published an article called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/12/09/to_my_white_male_facebook_friends/">To my white male Facebook friends</a>&rdquo; that pleads with the &ldquo;friends&rdquo; to understand their secret racism:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Y]ou may believe you are not racist. You may have never said the N-word. You may have non-white friends. However, there are many different forms of racism, not all of them are active. Many of them are passive, and they might be invisible to you, because you&rsquo;re a white man.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ta-Nehisi Coates of <em>The Atlantic</em>, who wrote a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/">lengthy call for reparations for slavery</a> last June, said in a recent interview that &ldquo;to be perfectly blunt, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with black people that the complete and total elimination of white supremacy would not fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are not the opinions of a radical minority. <em>The Atlantic</em> and <em>The Nation</em> are sold in bookstores and coffee shops, while <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/salon.com"><em>Salon</em></a> and <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/theguardian.com"><em>The Guardian</em></a> each hold impressive rankings among America&rsquo;s most visited websites, 350 and 106, respectively. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/nationalreview.com"><em>National Review</em></a> is at 1,211, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/takimag.com"><em>Takimag</em></a> 13,852, and <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/amren.com"><em>AmRen</em></a> 18,459.</p>

<p>In short, America is a racist country ruled by whites who kill non-whites with impunity. But I have a question: Why would anyone who believes that think it&rsquo;s a good idea to invite more non-whites to come to America?</p>
<p>If America is a fortress of white supremacy, isn&rsquo;t the arrival of more and more non-whites a human-rights disaster? Isn&rsquo;t it the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of people a year pouring into North Korea, where they will suffer bouts of mass starvation under its totalitarian regime? If Jews had picked up stakes from around the world in the 1930s to go live in Berlin, the liberal media would have risen up in one voice to call this insanity.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that non-whites so desperately want to come to the United States dispels the notion that this country is somehow &ldquo;white supremacist;&rdquo; people don&rsquo;t migrate to places that mistreat them. But let us leave that aside for now. We are not trying to follow the logic of illegal immigrants but of leftists.</p>
<p>If America places no value on the lives of blacks, why let in black Africans even if they want to come? Surely it is a crime to admit Somalis to a country where racist police shoot them down like dogs in the street. The leftist press doesn&rsquo;t seem to think Hispanics have it quite as bad as blacks, but surely a white supremacist nation treats them in a vile and loathsome way, too.</p>
<p>This should be the Left&rsquo;s logic: America is a white-supremacist nation that treats non-whites viciously, so non-whites should be warned to stay away. Why don&rsquo;t they take the logical position?</p>
<p>In some cases, the answer is blatant hostility towards whites, and a desire to see their power reduced by any means possible. Mexicans talk fairly openly about &ldquo;<a href="http://reason.com/archives/2010/07/19/mickey-kaus-interview/1">taking back</a>&rdquo; the southwestern United States, and some Chicanos, such as college professor <a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2212">Jose Angel Gutierrez</a>, talk about &ldquo;taking over.&rdquo; Also, the hostility so many blacks have for whites and their culture (shown in <a href="../../../archives/reports/rap-lyrics.html">rap lyrics</a> and demands that Western Civilization not be taught in universities), explains why many see non-white immigration as just another way to knock whitey off his perch.</p>
<p>Whites who have succumbed to ethnomasochism see non-white immigration as a sort of penance, and <a href="http://buchanan.org/blog/pjb-who-voted-for-clintons-revolution-378">welcome</a> their own dispossession. If the goal is to damage whites, white interests, and white society, there is no quicker and more permanent way to do it than through immigration. If that&rsquo;s the goal, it is not contradictory to attack white society as racist and morally bankrupt, while simultaneously promoting mass non-white immigration.</p>
<p>But there is an important economic reason. Leftist pundits and academics are paid to analyze, and the more turmoil there is, the more there is to analyze. The more racism is &ldquo;found,&rdquo; whether it be in <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/21/now-peanut-butter-and-jelly-sandwiches-are-racist/">peanut butter and jelly sandwiches</a> or <a href="http://www.thepoliticalcesspool.org/jamesedwards/tim-wise-calls-jesus-christ-symbol-white-supremacy-genocide-cnn/">Jesus Christ</a>, the more money is to be made through books, lectures, essays, and classes that denounce racism.</p>
<p>All anti-racist commentators benefit from high racial tensions-real or imagined-since it is their source of income. If America really were as racist as they made it out to be, a reasonable solution would be black repatriation like that of the <a href="../../../archives/back-issues/august-1998.html#cover">American Colonization Society</a>. However, if blacks were to flee American racism and return to Africa, leftist pundits would have a lot less to analyze and to mobilize about; it would be an economic disaster for them. African-American Studies programs at universities would close down, the Democratic Party would lose a huge bloc of voters, and it would be hard to fill the pages of <em>The Nation</em>.</p>
<p>Just as blacks escaping American &#8220;racism&#8221; would hurt the Left, non-white immigration helps it. It means more Chicano Studies programs, more votes for the Democratic Party, and more editorials about the tribulations of Hispanics in &ldquo;Amerikkka.&rdquo; Immigration is not only the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.vdare.com/articles/immigration-is-the-viagra-of-the-state-a-libertarian-case-against-immigration">Viagra of the state</a>&rdquo; as Peter Brimelow has put it, but the &ldquo;Viagra&rdquo; of every leftist institution. If Leftists were consistent, and persuaded all non-whites to flee our hopelessly racist country, it would mean sacrificing their jobs as permanent scolds.</p>
<p>The late Sam Francis had a keen understanding of this, and I leave the last word to him. As he explained at the <a href="../../../archives/conferences/ar1996.html">1996 American Renaissance conference</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What we need to do, in addition to building the scientific and scholarly case against egalitarianism and environmentalism, is to take a page from the book of the Left, to expose [leftists] . . . . as the beneficiaries of the egalitarian ideology they are trying to protect. We need to show that an entire political and economic industry gains wealth and power from egalitarian and environmental ideology, and &#8216;unmask&rsquo; or &#8216;deconstruct&rsquo; those interests. And we need in particular to show how Americans as taxpayers, as crime victims, as job and college applicants, and frankly, simply as white people, are being exploited and victimized by the lie of equality and the power structure that rests on it.</p></blockquote>

Just saw my mom and dad through that   &mdash;   bad. Our on-line appearance is pretty much our IQ, plus education, plus attitude. Really clever people can fake attitude and even assume a false personality. Luckily, there isn&rsquo;t any reason to do that on-line. I take an hour an day to check a few sites and throw my two cents in. Quite enjoyable. Center-Right sites are much superior to Left-wing ones, as Leftists are always angry, and looking to be insulted, so they can direct their hatred away from themselves. Rightists are usually willing to match ideas instead of venoms.</p>

Even though I do not carry his DNA (adopted at birth), I am terrified that I&rsquo;LL die the same way. Fortunately my husband is a medical professional.

I must admit I&rsquo;ve come through it with some &#8216;issues&rsquo; regarding hospice care. A sudden injury, and things played out, at warp speed, in a way I wasn&rsquo;t expecting. I hadn&rsquo;t thought about it in a pro-life way before, but, considering the testimony of people who come back after long comas about how aware they are, how much discomfort does someone who&rsquo;s (let&rsquo;s face it) dying of thirst and hunger feel, even when doped to the gills? I felt uncomfortable about what I was seeing and it&rsquo;s going to bother me until I find some answers. I don&rsquo;t know about the medical science, but I acknowledge that the hospice people have their PR down pat. Maybe a bit too pat&hellip;..</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-702475" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The main thing people must understand is that in human society, or societies, dominance is a perfect zero-sum game. In a multi-racial state, one race, only one, will dominate all others. Once upon a time, whites in the US used derogatory phrases about non-whites. Today, whites shut up, if they know what&rsquo;s good for them, while the derogatory phrases are all heading the other way. The point to remember is that one group is always going to be bad-mouthing all other groups, no matter which group might be on top.</p>

Everywhere I go I see zero sum mentalities which seem kind of dumb and primitive. If you run a business and treat your customers and employees right, and maintain the business, it will reward you back. You feed the cow you milk, you don&rsquo;t starve it. I see the opposite usually. I also see a lot of unnecessary conflict and antagonism as a result of zero sum mindsets. I can burn down my neighbor&rsquo;s house, but it doesn&rsquo;t make me any richer. </p>
<p>In regards to race, I have no interest in dominance. I just look to have basic law and order to exist, competent leadership, competent laws etc. We can all operate under those things. Even if some do better than others or rise to more prominent positions, it&rsquo;s not necessarily zero sum. A boss doesn&rsquo;t need to exploit his employees. He just does typically because we live in a primitive, low I.Q. society.</p>

Sorry you don&rsquo;t like it. How we handle reality determines which &#8216;side&rsquo; we end up on. Rightists do their reality-testing and operate accordingly.

<p>As for why the left wing is so internally contradictory on racial matters, I think that&rsquo;s not a matter of schizophrenia or mental illness, as such. I happen to think that the real archons of the left wing deliberately spew contradictory rhetoric on race and other matters, and blurt them through the microphone, as sort of a social Rorschach test. They&rsquo;re trying to see who will and will not spout contradictions without reservation, and spouting these contradictions is to left wing individuals, a form of social signaling that they are or want to be the &#8220;right&#8221; people.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-700791" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You have behind closed doors the elite make policy decisions, then sell it to the people. The people think they are making the decisions. So its hard to assess their motivations, except to say they are intelligent enough to understand obvious and simple contradictions. Then the majority of people (including academia) are fed slogans and emotional conditioning. Not much different from the Nazi party. Among the public and in academia yes it is a simplistic system where one party represents the elite and one represents the victims. It&rsquo;s a mockery of the old roman Patriarch/pleb political system. No real democracy would evolve this way (you would have many different parties). Rome only evolved this way because it had basically two racial classes (which in some ways they are trying to mimic as well).</p>
<p>Behind all the simplistic slogans and emotional appeals given to the public the two parties are the same. When we look at their agenda we find a desire to either destroy or transform the white race (or in the least shrink it to something negligible). At the same time we see Jewish supremacism- zionism, special protection for jews, massive resources sent to fight antisemitism etc. </p>
<p>This to me is the source of any kind of &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; feelings I might have. I like most Jews I meet. I have nothing against Jewish people or culture, but rather admire it. Yet I just question this agenda where government and other social institutions bash white people, discriminate against them, preach hatred of them, and conversely promote special privileges and protection of Jews. </p>
<p>Blacks, Hispanics etc. just seem to be pawns in this agenda. I suspect that the day will come where the Jewish poplation has grown enough and white population shrunk enough that these policies and propaganda will reverse because they are no longer useful. Policies will become more &#8220;conservative&#8221; and harsh towards blacks, hispanics and the rest.</p>
<p>Just look at Israel. Most of the extreme left wing, black loving Jews move to Israel and suddenly transform into conservative extremists who believe in the supremacy of the Jewish race and a Jew&rsquo;s only nation. So we can say that these &#8220;beliefs&#8221; are more like strategies rather than something they believe in. </p>

They just hate it when the white man uses it. It&rsquo;s their special little word that they can club whitey with as well as to manipulate him for more government goodies. </p>
<p>Blacks who claim that they&rsquo;ve only taken a negative word and removed its power as a force against them is absurd. Blacks use the term all the time as a put-down to other blacks, and not just as a means of showing racial solidarity. </p>
<p>Either way, the entire notion is silly from the outset. Can you imagine the Chinese who were discriminated against in the early 19th century choosing to call each other &#8220;chinks&#8221;? Their customary greeting would be something along the lines of, &#8220;Hey, what happening chink?&#8221; Or the Japanese after WW2 calling each other &#8220;Japs&#8221;? A common greeting toward their own kind would be, &#8220;Hey Jap, what&rsquo;s going on?&#8221; It&rsquo;s so stupid, it&rsquo;s laughable. </p>
<p>Yet blacks continue to call each other the &#8216;N&rsquo; word without any collective sense of its degrading nature. Blacks may not like the low opinion that most of the world has of them, but they do little in their power to change it.</p>

They watch &#8216;historical fiction&#8221; like The Butler, Selma, The Help, 12 years a slave, Mandela, and all the other garbage that they substitute for reality. I live with a liberal who watches 40 hours of movies and TV per week, largely &#8220;Oprah interviews another wise and brilliant movie star&#8221; or &#8220;The View&#8221; type of show, or another movie or &#8220;award winning&#8221; cable series whose sub-plot always includes white hero standing up against racist whites who are plotting against an innocent black. Zero news for her, but she reads op-eds that she confuses for news. She tells me that &#8220;Cops&#8221; and &#8220;the First 48&#8221; brainwash me into thinking that blacks are bad, and ACTUALLY believes that Michael Brown was shot in the back with his hands up. She gets very upset if I attempt to tell her the truth. Her eyes get really big and her jaw gapes in fear and dread over the monster I am. Indeed, my words sound just like every &#8220;evil&#8221; racist killer in her movies. I am counting on her growing wiser with age, as she will be forced to witness the REAL racism that our little pasty white son will definitely be experiencing when he starts school. I love her alot; she is sincere in her beliefs. She is a victim of TV and college. When I tell her the truth about what I see in the world (she was very sheltered and doesn&rsquo;t work), she literally starts crying and remains disturbed for days, literally afraid that I&rsquo;m some raving, unstable lunatic. This is what a lifetime of TV has done to her mind. If not for the pregnancy, I would have given up a long time ago and never looked back. I have to just bide my time and bite my tongue, because if I tell her the unvarnished truth she will leave me to try to &#8220;protect&#8221; our son from my &#8220;insanity.&#8221;</p>

He uses the word &#8220;dago&#8221; as a term of endearment towards fellow Italians. He also uses the word as an adjective. He will say things like &#8220;I just picked up a fresh loaf of dago bread&#8221;. Its not exactly the same as how Blacks use the N-word, but it is an example of taking some pride in a word that was supposed to be an insult. One major difference is that he truly is proud of who he is, so he doesn&rsquo;t consider the word to be an insult even when used by a non-Italian person.</p>

<p>But when the white man uses it (which he rarely does), what does it signify? IMO it captures the ultimate sense of inferiority in the mind of a black: that they are a failed population; that they are out of their element in the white world; that they are a loser third-world population in an energetic, striving, successful first world civilization; that they don&rsquo;t belong here, and all their posturing and blame-shifting is just a pathetic attempt to conceal this embarrassing truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;take a page from the book of the Left, to expose [leftists] . . . . as the beneficiaries of the egalitarian ideology they are trying to protect. We need to show that an entire political and economic industry gains wealth and power from egalitarian and environmental ideology, and &lsquo;unmask&rsquo; or &lsquo;deconstruct&rsquo; those interests&#8221;.</p>
<p>Deconstructionism may prevail at university and in the popular print but some scholars claim it is useless and a bankrupt philosophy or not even a proper philosophy at all. Deconstructing the deconstructionists, however, is a proper and useful pursuit.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-699124" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I agree with most of what you are saying, other than your last paragraph. </p>
<p>We should avoid literally dehumanizing rhetoric. People we disagree with, dislike, or even are outraged by are human beings, not &#8220;rats&#8221;. Furthermore, insisting on 100% perfection in politicians is a formula for a lifetime of fruitless and futile rage. Instead, we should learn from the Left and its success in moving things its way in incremental fashion. Even in 2008 Obama did not run on &#8220;gay marriage&#8221; or unilateral executive amnesty; he understood the need to go only as far as the electorate would tolerate, then push the envelope bit by bit once in power. </p>
<p>Not all the politicians you listed are identical in the degree to which they hold objectionable stances on issues of paramount importance to us. For example, Romney was alone in the top tier of GOP contenders in both 2008 and 2012 in opposing amnesty. While he ruled out mass deportation (other than of violent criminals) he insisted the bulk of illegal aliens (other than &#8220;Dreamers&#8221;) have to return home to apply from there for permission to come here, like any other foreigner, and illegals still here be excluded from government benefits, be denied employment by mandatory e-Verify and employer crackdowns, and in effect be squeezed into giving up and &#8220;self deportation&#8221;. </p>
<p>Most of the Republican contenders also would be far superior on the crucial issue of judicial nominations. Romney for instance had Robert Bork as his judicial selection advisor. Ultimately that means things like Prop 187 in California and SB 1170 in Arizona would have a better chance of survival and implementation. </p>
<p>You have to be smart, ice cold, and use you head, not just your emotions.</p>

They have been taught that they have been discriminated against by the evil White man. Some of them actually feel a closer bond with the non-whites than White males due to the fact they are all &#8216;oppressed minorities&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve noticed this phenomenon in White homosexuals also.</p>

And all the residents, part time or full time have the kind of marketable skills and therefore the kind of income that allows them to totally escape the effects of the PC insanity that they all mouth. There are such places all over America. And those places will make it possible for the best and the brightest to totally escape the hell they have wrought for the rest of us. Indefinitely.</p>
