All three would be far better off if they were Christian. Though the three have low murder rates and have produced very few terrorists, a comparison of quality of life to neighboring Christian lands is staggering. Turkey has a 66% literacy rate, and was still committing vicious genocide against the Armenians in the recent past. Albania and Bosnia are wretchedly impoverished when compared to Greece or Croatia. </p>

On the contrary &#8220;prophet&#8221; mohamed ordered Muslims to kill or enslave non-Muslims and he himself killed, enslaved, raped many. And as he is the best man and THE model to follow for all mankind, all time and all places, you get even non-religious Muslim Turks genociding Christian Armenians: they didn&rsquo;t genocide Muslim neighbors, they targeted the Armenians because they were Christians. Usually Muslims turn against each others only when there are not anymore or not many non-Muslims to kill first.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-693456" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Right David. The reason we should take a realistic look at Hitler is to better understand what is happening in the USG, today. Hitler was not a cartoon character, but was a real man like obama or FDR. The closest thing to Hitler in our country was FDR, and now obama; not in violence, but in the methods used by the president to activate the USG to break laws.<br/>
I read Weikart&rsquo;s book about darwinism and Hitler. As Weikart said; &#8220;Hitler had inbibed some really bad ideas&#8221;.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-693492" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I will read it then. I stoped believing in neo darwinism a long time ago. The science is pointing in another direction and the best scientists knew thirty years ago that darwinism or anything close to it was a failed theory. Weikart does not believe in darwinism at all and sees it as it is; a religion that says man invented himself. The idea that man made himself has been around for more than two thousand years.<br/>
Darwinism is proved to be false at the level of the cell. Did you know that DNA is used only to make protein folds, It has nothing to do with how a heart or eye or fingernail is made. Scientists have no idea where the information comes from to make body parts. That makes the probability of darwinism being correct, so improbable that it is off the chart.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-695500" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Not even close. In terms of temperament, ideology, racial views, foreign policy, I&rsquo;d argue that Hitler had the most in common with Teddy Roosevelt or Andrew Jackson. Hitler was an ardent anti-communist, and simply would not have been particularly fond of the soft morals of either or a leftist ideology that resembled the ideology of either. Absurd. Jackson and TR both were also quasi-genocidal (consider the natives!), somewhat megalomaniacal, populists and orators. They were no-nonsense types, like Adolf. FDR was more of a compromiser, peddler and charismatic smooth-talker. Obama is much the same. Hitler was nothing of the sort. He was very frank about the perils and problems Germany faced and demanded every citizen contribute to its recovery, even with the many things he promised. He didn&rsquo;t promise them as goodies in other words, like most leftist politicians do, as social comfort systems with no inherent cost. I have no doubt either that Teddy or Andrew would have been equally violent if the world&rsquo;s largest Communist nation was amassing a tremendous military on our border&hellip; FDR? LOL.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-696028" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Your first point is ridiculous. Your second point is inscrutable. In certain societies, they make god the state (Iran, Saudi Arabia), in others like communist ones, they make the state itself god in pursuit of an undesirable level of equality. What a man wishes to do with the state is highly relevant and distinguishes various types of statism. One moreover, has to, if one is to be fair, acknowledge the many types of religious statism that are not federal in nature. For example, certain historical religious societies, like puritan societies, which were hardly more friendly to individual freedom than present day Islamist states. Lastly, god doesn&rsquo;t exist. Never has. All the crap supposedly written in his name was written by half-baked philosophers likely on hallucinogens or at the very least, driven by delusions of grandeur. Not that there is never any good in religion, only that it is perfectly unrelated to god. Every religious society prescribes something different, false, and typically immoral in the name of god. Believing in god is no guarantee of anything except delusion, and certainly does not yield a successful society. Look at Africa or the Middle East, both riddled with religion and superstition, and both wholly intolerable wastelands replete with poverty and human misery.</p>

He failed to unite the Protestant churches and was derisive but tolerant of pagan mysticism. He reportedly said that after the war, he would deal with the RC priests as he had deal with the Jews. The patriotic efforts of Christian theologians like Karl Adam to bring Catholicism into line with National Socialism were rebuffed, and the RC church suffered intermittent indignities at the hands of Nazis, especially HJ thugs.

It would be blasphemy. For the same reasons muslim countries didn&rsquo;t sign the Universal Human Right Declaration and made up their own, because they cannot outlaw many crimes, as allah allows them and mohamed himself did them.</p>

I started to use Anna Doe when I became an atheist and islamocritic in 2005. Doe was for anonymous but also to hint to a metamorphose: doe seemed like deux (two) in French. And when I became a race realist some two years ago, I changed to Anna Tree (like three with a French accent), a third stage in my growing out of incorrect opinions. I should maybe call myself Anna Tetrad already, since I changed my mind about the dogmas of gender theory as well (like homosexuality is innate, sex is a social construct, children don&rsquo;t need a married mom and dad etc). But maybe I grew out of that fad.</p>

<p>Those countries signed the declaration in 1948, after decades of Western/White colonization and so Western/White education, when they weren&rsquo;t following islam like today.</p>
<p>Since then, some have come forward saying that the Declaration of Human Rights contradicts the sharia in many points and so all muslim countries have now signed their own 1990 Cairo Declaration for Human Rights in Islam  &mdash;  with sharia law as &ldquo;the only source of reference&rdquo;, quite withdrawing their former signatures of 1948, with claims that the UN Declaration of Human Rights is Western in orientation and not compatible with islam.</p>

i don&rsquo;t understand why Jews are hated and expelled from countries. Maybe the religion scares them. I do know that the world expects us to behave better than the rest of the world. There&rsquo;s a double standard where<br/>
we are concerned. I always expected more from religious Jews. Not the ultra orthodox just ordinary religious people but I&rsquo;ve been disappointed.<br/>
Many years ago i was on a shop in England and the man told me he&rsquo;d been stationed in Palestine during the war. He told me where he was living and I told him that&rsquo;s where the prostitutes hang out.<br/>

A better question to ask might be: What use is Western Civilization if our current path is one of appeasement and cowardly refusal to face facts? There comes a point, like Ancient Rome came to and passed, where the traditional values and mores that built a great civilization become subject to open ridicule and debasement. Foreign invaders, whether they carry a sword or a suitcase, are here to stay and change the demographics of America and Europe forever. </p>
<p>I hate to say this, but under current conditions, backing Islam seems like the winning choice. In 75 years who will wield more influence - white Americans and Europeans, or the Islamic hordes that are already destroying European cities and reproducing in far greater numbers than whites.</p>

Soros funded the Fergudishu protests and the Tides Foundation funded some Sacred Journey by some ultra left group to &#8220;Palestine,&#8221; IIRC. The Tides Foundation also funds ultra left groups per Jim Simpson: </p>
<p>&#8220;ACLU, ACORN, Center for American Progress, Center for Constitutional Rights (a communist front,) CAIR, Earth Justice, Institute for Policy Studies (KGB spy nest), National Lawyers Guild (oldest communist front in U.S.), People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and practically every other radical group there is. ACORN&rsquo;s Wade Rathke runs a Tides subsidiary, the Tides Center.&#8221; </p>
<p>That only scratches the surface. On any one day Trevor<br/>
Loudon exposes more than I do in 10 years. And Terresa Monroe-Hamilton back in September had the story on how our political elites live high on the hog compared to us schlubs, including a run down of the fabulously wealthy people who are in Congress.</p>
<p>That said I still think there is an intellectual weakness or<br/>
blindness on the part of Westerners themselves. Europeans have been astonishingly stingy with their electoral support of nationalist/salvationist parties. God bless the PEGIDA heroes but one can&rsquo;t fail to notice that large numbers of counter demonstrators turned out as well. </p>
<p>Just those two facts are damning as to Westerners&rsquo; political<br/>
consciousness. One good day on the internet is enough to make anyone open their eyes if, for example, all they&rsquo;ve ever been exposed to in the legacy media is stories about how wonderful mass immigration and denial of free speech are.</p>

<p>When the megaphone and the stage are owned and controlled by the opposition, one has little chance of having one&rsquo;s voice heard.</p>
<p>In addition, when one is living comfortably and knows that the comfort can be summarily removed for the simple infraction of saying the wrong thing, one&rsquo;s strong tendency is to keep ones mouth shut.</p>
<p>Once again, as I see it, all the levers of power are owned and controlled by the opposition.</p>

I started that over 30 years ago when the book was translated into English and Russian as is and it was only one. I mean that when last week I searched the Internet I found too many translations and ALL of them were doctored politically. So what is removed, edited.<br/>
Islam is the only one religion which does not teach, suggest, asks and so on. Quran ORDERS! If you do not follow to the letter you are an apostate and have to die.<br/>
Here are some commands.<br/>
1. All Christians and Jews are apostates and you must kill them. If for any reason you cannot do it right away let them live beside you until a proper moment comes. Meantime they must pay a high tax (zakat), ware a distinguished clothes, walk on the road shoulder, and their words are not accepted by court.<br/>
2. To lie any time anywhere for whatever reason to infidels, their authorities and laws is honorable act.<br/>

On 9/11 I served in the DHS in Detroit. In a couple of days after we got the inner information. The news-media people went door-to-door in Dearborn (predominantly and the largest arab community in the USA) . Avery adult muslim blamed the act. ? However, some reporters talk to their kids separately. All (ALL!!!) kids said that their families celebrated 9/11. That never got on TV and in papers.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-692258" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have to disagree on the food and music. The Catholic bishop of the diocese of Iraq said it best. Islam has destroyed the Arabic culture. If you are a musician, and have listened to any amount of Greek music, you have go admit that the music of this part of the world is excellent, and cannot help but to respect the talent of the musicians. Arabic/Turkish music closely resembles Greek music, with quarter tones, haunting minor keys, and plaintive vocals. Very complex musically and very interesting. I enjoy a Greek radio hour on Sunday afternoons in my area. The cuisine is also excellent. Chicken Shawarma, Hummus, lots of Garlic. Baklava for dessert. Though very different from Europe beyond Greece/The Balkans, I love the music/cuisine of the Middle East. It is the Islamic religion that is repulsive and inferior. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-692523" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Well, generally what you&rsquo;re enjoying from Arabic culture is their (non-islamic) Byzantine and Persian roots, two of the most astounding extinct cultures on earth. The sand-dwelling Arabs and barbarian Turks merely appropriated that culture since they had none of their own. Look up &#8220;byzantine secular classical music by Christodoulos Halaris&#8221; it&rsquo;s astounding.</p>
<p>Food is similar. Byzantines specialized in small cakes similar to your baklava and introduced lot so of interesting lamb and sausage dishes. The farther you get into the middle east, the more the cuisine resembles ancient Persian.</p>
<p>Persian and Byzantine trade routes essentially spread their culture, just like America does with burgers, fries and cola (one of the most popular food combos in the world) and hollywood movies/music.</p>
<p>Islam has destroyed much of the fantastic wine and pork culture of the middle east. Most interesting Byzantine wines are gone forever, and the vinyards of Shiraz in Persia now produce only inferior table grapes.</p>

<p>It could be that the super elites don&rsquo;t feel the threat of non-Whites as imminent as the middle class Whites would feel. As a last checked, a typical &#8220;affluent&#8221; town where those people live is about ~90% White and ~7% Asian, and their non-White super elite friends are often totally assimilated, perhaps making them feel that these non-White super elites can somehow help them &#8220;manage&#8221; other non-Whites and make things work.</p>

Centuries of abuse at the hands of men like Shylock catalyzed pent-up rage and righteous anger.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-693021" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Gays and feminists are completely insane for believing that. Islam may occasionally masquerade as a religion, but is in fact the most repressive *political ideology* in existence. What other &#8220;religion&#8221; absolutely demands authority over the day-to-day lives of non-believers or extorts a &#8220;jizya&#8221; (sp.?) tax from them? </p>
<p>My devoutly Mormon neighbors were surprised at me working in the garden on Sundays - I guess since I seem so otherwise straight-laced - but accepted it. Heck; I don&rsquo;t regard vegetable gardening as &#8220;work&#8221;, anyway. If it wasn&rsquo;t fun, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it. One can always buy produce at the supermarket instead. They asked whether I was &#8220;some sort of atheist&#8221;. I explained that my mother is a failed Methodist and my father a failed Catholic; I was never baptized or raised in any religion at all. My only church service was as a tourist at Westminster Abby in London, in which I remained silent. Those neighbors still remained friendly afterward: decent people. They were having a house built, and moved last autumn, but my daughter played with their kids much of the summer.</p>
<p>Some of the old &#8220;blue laws&#8221; here in Colorado involved the liquor stores having to remain closed on Sundays. Those were repealed, and it wasn&rsquo;t Christian groups who objected. It was owner-operators of small &#8220;mom-and-pop&#8221; liquor stores who didn&rsquo;t want to work seven days a week, but who ran businesses small enough that they couldn&rsquo;t afford to hire more people. Their motive was strictly commercial. Any Christian religious objections to folks here buying liquor on Sundays were thus beneath the radar.</p>
<p>Jews haven&rsquo;t demanded that the rest of us refrain from eating pigs, rabbits, catfish, shellfish, octopus, sharks, horses, or cheeseburgers (non-kosher to serve mammal meat with a milk product.)</p>
<p>Hindus aren&rsquo;t supposed to eat beef, but one with whom I worked said he didn&rsquo;t try to eat &#8220;too much&#8221; beef. Another Hindu thought the term &#8220;hamburger&#8221; meant &#8220;ham&#8221;, i.e. pork, rather than &#8220;from Hamburg&#8221;, a city in Germany. I never told her. She got her PhD at Rutgers and 20 years later maybe she knows now, though I wasn&rsquo;t going to be deliberately cruel. They&rsquo;re certainly not telling us to refrain from eating cloven-hoofed ungulates - &#8220;or else&#8221;.</p>
<p>Only in Islam do we see this creepy, violent &#8220;I be Mudlim! I be in charge!&#8221; ideology, wherein they make constant demands on others who owe them absolutely nothing, followed of course by threats. Does this sound like anyone else we North Americans know and loathe?</p>

<p>Buddhism, while not really a religion in the strict sense, doesn&rsquo;t even have a fraction of a fraction of the destructive elements and zealot-creating properties that Islam brings about whenever and wherever it is allowed to grow in the West. So it&rsquo;s not just simply about an alien culture and alien people being introduced into the West. It&rsquo;s about Islam and the incompatibility of its adherents with Western values, culture and people.</p>

<p>We had patriarchal societies, usually only the men were out being the breadwinners, whilst the womenfolk made a home and looked after the children. We would not put up with buggery, or degenerate behaviour, we used to hang people for serious crimes. We used to teach girls and boys separately, or in some cases even play in different playgrounds. </p>
<p>But that is what we perhaps should get back to, rather than allowing Islam to fill up the void and offer their &#8220;solutions&#8221; to the problems of a liberal West. For it is in the absence of traditionalism (and the destruction of the Church) that Islam grows as a force, along with their birthrates, of course. It is filling a vacuum. </p>
<p>I have yet to watch Jared&rsquo;s video. I am sure it will be good as usual and making many very valid points.</p>
<p>However, whilst I recognise Islam, as a faith, being a major component in European problems and a conquering force that ought to be fought off, I am getting a bit disturbed as to how much Islam is drifting into what is, or has historically been, a site for racial issues. </p>
<p> If there was a horrific choice to make, as to whether European lands could remain European but they have to take up Islam (or willingly take it up) - or face racial dilution and evaporation, I would suspect remaining our race would be the primary issue.</p>
<p>The religiosity of civilisations can always change, but you cannot bring the white race back from the dead.</p>
<p>Islam is a real problem, a real pain in the backside, a real threat. But it is not the only threat and nor do I think it is the primary threat, despite being the noisiest and the one rammed in front of us all the time.</p>

<p>Islam is a great stepping stone issue to further thought. It&rsquo;s not at all uncommon for people to progress from noticing severe the cultural incompatibilities of Islam, to realizing how powerless PC values are to correct those incompatibilities, to grasping the vital importance of race and demographics. Alas, the more forceful the focus on the first two of these three, the greater the delay in recognizing the third. This is why &#8220;neoconservatism&#8221; (broadly speaking) is so problematic, because it talks a tough game and leads people to believing it has answers, but its policies only ensure the continuance of anti-white demographic trends.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-692648" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have read the Bible from cover to cover including the Apocrypha in seven English translations. I have read the Koran in three English translations. </p>
<p>The Koran mentions figures from the Bible, but it mentions mentions them in the kind of anecdotes that appear in Bible stories written for children.</p>
<p>The Koran reveals no understanding of the theology found in the writings of the Old Testament prophets, and in the New Testament epistles. Although Muhammad claimed to be God&rsquo;s greatest prophet, the Koran mentions none of the writing prophets. </p>
<p>Islam is a religion that bases its authority on the word of honor of one man. Muhammed performed no miracles. He came before the Arab people with the Koran and said in effect, &#8220;This was dictated to me by the Angel Gabriel. Trust me. It was.&#8221; </p>
<p>Christianity bases its authority on the Bible. The Bible was written during a period of about fourteen hundred years by many men and perhaps a few women. It the Bible is a hoax, one has to believe in a conspiracy lasting that long. </p>
<p>When Muhammad was forty years old he was an obscure merchant with one wife who was ten years older than he was. As the result of the religion he founded he became rich, powerful, and the possessor of a harem of lovely young ladies. He married one of them when she was six years old.</p>
<p>As the result of the religion he founded, Jesus was flogged, and killed on the cross. St. Paul was flogged several times. He was beheaded.</p>

<p>Neither really did Dante. In the Divine Comedy he had an easy time describing the torments of Hell, and the mildly less severe torments of Purgatory. When he describes Heaven it does not seem to consist of much but discussing theology with saints. One reads it wondering, &#8220;When is the fun going to start?&#8221;</p>

It is their society, as it sands alone, never mind the islam part. Read any book that gives a factual picture of any muslim country and it will show you where islam comes from; not from mohamad, but from the people, reaching back 1,000s of years. They are barely out of the caves, as far as their society is concerned<br/>
It has taken thousands of years for European peoples to develop a way of living that gave us the modern age. It is not each White individually, but all of as a whole that make our world function at such a high level. Christianity is the root of our success, and the trunk and limbs are the society of White people, all getting along and working together.</p>

I would not have derived so much pleasure from helping the people in the informal GED study class I started in federal prison, were I of naturally wicked inclination. I was teaching them about conic sections just before my release, and that wasn&rsquo;t going to be on their tests. If I was well-liked for doing this, was I manipulating them? </p>
<p>They passed their tests and wrote to me to say so, after my own release, and I was delighted, even though I gained nothing at that point. If that was part of the &#8220;Purposeful End&#8221; you mentioned, whatever happened to the concept of free will?</p>
<p>Am I am only (only?) a particularly intelligent form of animal? Animals don&rsquo;t have original sin. Even some pack instinct wouldn&rsquo;t explain why I was later happy for them, a thousand miles away. I&rsquo;ve been home 11 years and off paper 8 years, and I still regard that as a job well done. Pity is not a uniquely Christian concept.</p>
<p>God sometimes messes around with me. When I found a five dollar bill last year, I said &#8220;Thank you, God!&#8221; Within the minute, I found a twenty. I imagined He decided &#8220;Let&rsquo;s jack with this agnostic a bit.&#8221; Maybe it was just keen eyes and corrective lenses. </p>
<p>One of my old childhood bullies died in a hospice last August. He apparently went off his bicycle somewhere in Washington state and smashed his head, leaving a wife and two kids behind. If he&rsquo;d have driven here and said he was sorry, I&rsquo;d have taken him him and our respective kids fishing. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what God would want?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-693130" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi Michael. Always a pleasure to read your posts.</p>
<p>Of course, theology can be complicated. Before I get to your post, just let me clarify that I was responding to the &#8220;Jews killed Jesus&#8221; post. That claim is one that contradicts Christianity, not necessarily on the basis of an event (the Crucifixion), but rather on the reason for Christ&rsquo;s life in the first place (to be a living example and a perfect sacrifice for all sinners and for all sin). He would have chosen to die for all of us with or without the presence of any Jews. </p>
<p>I am not surprised that you have done some good and selfless acts in your life. It is probably safe to say that most people have done similar things also. </p>
<p>The questions really comes down to: Is there a God? Was Jesus, God in the flesh? And: Did Jesus die for the sins of the world and, very important, did he rise from the dead? If Jesus did not show victory over death, then he was just a nice guy with some nice things to say. </p>
<p>So, there are the choices we have. If Jesus is God, he said the only to God the Father is through Him. It matters not how many nice things we have done. Many might want to argue with Jesus on this point, but if he is God, He makes the rules. It is His world. Things must be done His way.</p>
<p>If you decide He did not rise from the dead, that he is not God and that God doesn&rsquo;t really concern himself with us one way or the other, that is a different path altogether. No matter how you cut it, it does take faith to be a Christian. </p>
<p>For one with a scientific mind like yours, may I suggest watching the DVD &#8220;The Star of Bethlehem.&#8221; I think you will find it fascinating.</p>
<p>Also may I suggest from a former intellectual atheist, C.S. Lewis, the book &#8220;Mere Christianity.&#8221;</p>

<p>I read C.S. Lewis in college. He was good. That said, I want victory, rather than salvation. When people like me have permanent settlements on Mars, the moons of Jupiter and finally on planets orbiting other stars, I will call it &#8220;finished&#8221;.

<p>The biggest question we face in life is what happens when we die? Do we just turn to dirt or is there an existence afterward? </p>
<p>Religions try to give hope that there is something more. If there isn&rsquo;t, what difference do any of our &#8220;accomplishments&#8221; make? </p>
<p>Even on this site concerning race realism. I am here because I haven&rsquo;t seen a compelling argument that God would just have us lay down and be conquered by masses from the Third World. If that is so, as so many liberals try to profess, then Western Civilization would never have made it out of its infancy. There would also never have been a United States. I can&rsquo;t believe that path is correct. </p>
<p>So obviously, I believe in God and a life hereafter. It&rsquo;s a struggle trying to understand what to do to treat others correctly and still protect your family, country and culture. Life was simpler when people were separated. The greed that brought us slavery, the greed today that brings an attitude that GDP is all that is important, and PC brainwashing that promotes &#8220;diversity and multiculturalism&#8221; have really put us in a bad situation. I just want to do what is right, but I really have not arrived at any clear answers after dealing with these issues for over 25 years.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-694005" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>AmRen is not the best or most appropriate place to debate either the Christian religion or the &#8220;Holocaust religion&#8221;, but I would state that &#8220;the Bible&#8221; is not a single Book of faultless historical accuracy, but a library of documents selected by the RC Church long after the death of Jesus. The unreliability of &#8220;factual detail&#8221; in the New Testament is notably evident in the gospel accounts of the trial(s), crucifixion and resurrection. Numerous modern first-rate scholarly, even relatively conservative and &#8220;apologetic&#8221; commentaries and studies, make this quite clear; e.g. among hundreds Ernst Bammel &amp; C.F.D. Moule (eds) &#8220;Jesus and the Politics of His Day&#8221; (Cambridge 1985).</p>
<p>It seems to me that the collaborationist Judean priesthood, especially after the Temple incident, regarded Jesus as a disturber of the peace and a threat to their own interests - Annas was making a nice little profit from the &#8220;den of thieves&#8221; - whether or not they also seriously suspected him of sorcery.</p>
<p>They were out to get him and to implicate the Roman authority in his removal. But according to his statement to Caiaphas, he did not claim to be God himself but eventually coming as a judge on his behalf. Incorrigibly severe blasphemy would normally have resulted in being stoned and hung up on a tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;The titles Messiah and Son of the Blessed One are not blasphemy, since a Jewish king could be both, but they are politically dangerous&#8221; (see e.g. &#8220;The Jewish Annotated New Testament&#8221; [Oxford 2011] p.92).</p>
<p>I do not deny the possibility of God and therefore &#8220;miracles&#8221;, but cannot see how a real man could also be God, especially if he prays to himself and had an artificially created male gene. Not even God can square a circle.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-692926" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Islam is not a threat in itself. It is a tool used by others. From the Winter 2011 issue of <i>The New Atlantis</i>: &#8220;Forty-six Muslim countries combined contribute just 1 percent of the world&rsquo;s scientific literature; Spain and India each contribute more of the world&rsquo;s scientific literature than those countries taken together. In fact, although Spain is hardly an intellectual superpower, it translates more books in a single year than the entire Arab world has in the past thousand years&hellip;Between 1980 and 2000, Korea granted 16,328 patents, while nine Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the U.A.E., granted a combined total of only 370, many of them registered by foreigners. A study in 1989 found that in one year, the United States published 10,481 scientific papers that were frequently cited, while the entire Arab world published only four. This may sound like the punch line of a bad joke, but when Nature magazine published a sketch of science in the Arab world in 2002, its reporter identified just three scientific areas in which Islamic countries excel: desalination, falconry, and camel reproduction. &#8220;</p>

But that does nothing for energy independence since almost no cars can use natural gas and almost no electricity comes from oil - the extra natural gas is simply undercutting coal instead. While domestic natural gas is better for the environment than domestic coal, that&rsquo;s no net gain for energy independence, since it leaves the issue of our cars&rsquo; dependence on oil-derived fuel unaffected. </p>
<p>We should ignore the libertarian absolutists and insist on strong measures to encourage natural gas cars, electric cars, and flex fuel vehicles (which can run on natural gas derived methanol fuel as well as gasoline).</p>

Just imagine Andrew Jackson throwing his cell phone against a tree and smashing his laptop computer, in a fit of rage because of not being able to get revenge on the British, for the time when during his youth a British officer slashed his face with a sword!</p>

Without a little hatred, there likely would never have been an American Revolution. How quickly Americans forget who their enemies are and why they are so. Even during WW2, that snake Churchill was enthusiastically ceding whole swathes of Europe to the Soviet Communists. Yeah, a real hero for the West. In order to maintain their empire (and for little other reason), the British twice dragged America into an unnecessary war on their side. The world is a worse place today given that fact.</p>

In 1916 and 1940 Germany sought peace with Britain, including withdrawal of armed forces, but certain influences based in the USA put pressure on both the US and the UK politicians. The loss of the British Empire and of eastern Europe was no benefit to anyone except the Stalin-Roosevelt-Hiss coterie. Since 1945 Britain has been a dependent on America, and since 1956 a tool of its foreign policy. English politicians like Mosley opposed these developments all along. Now the Anglo-Saxon peoples should unite against greater common dangers.</p>
<p>On Churchill, read both his admirer Martin Gilbert in &#8220;Churchill and the Jews&#8221; and his detractor David Irving in &#8220;Churchill&rsquo;s War, vol.1&#8221;.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-693238" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Exceptions to God Muslims noted - but those opinions expose the greater problem. Making exceptions for bad behaviors!!! There was once a time when threats to our family and communities would not be tolerated. Some losses are too hurtful and every threat, including potential threats were removed. Exceptions provide the opportunity for Good Muslins to be angered and act to to avenge their religious brethren. Our heritage cannot endure more diversity. The extraction of trouble must be broad and inclusive - otherwise you&rsquo;re splitting hairs - relying upon the source of the problem to behave themselves, or automatically presuming a Good (?) will not go bad. The same is seen in avoiding collateral damage in war. There are no innocents in war. On some level every member of the society plays a role to support and perpetuate the war. Love and support, clothes, feeding, giving a reason to fight&hellip; all prolong the battle. Want to end war? Start killing a mans family. That hurts. That removes his will to fight and his support devices. We have not won a war since avoiding collateral damage.</p>

Then they might deal with Jews everywhere. The folks that denuded Christianity and Judaism from the Arab peninsula are determined, something we lack.</p>

If you care enough about this issue, there&rsquo;s something you can individually do every day that makes a difference. Get a car that can run on something other than gasoline or petro-diesel, and run it on that something else.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to get a flex fuel vehicle (FFV) and run it on E85 ethanol, easiest if there&rsquo;s a filling station selling E85 within a reasonable driving distance of your home. Easiest because there is a big variety of FFVs (cars, SUVs, pickup trucks, minivans, etc.) from many automakers, including affordable used ones. There are 2,400 stations selling E85 right now. </p>
<p>Another is to get an electric car or a plug-in hybrid, and charge up at home in your garage for your everyday local driving needs. The plug-in hybrids such as the Chevy Volt, Ford Fusion Energi, etc., can fall back on gasoline for relatively rare long distance driving. If you can afford it, you should without question get the Tesla Model S, arguably the finest car ever made. The Nissan Leaf and BWM i3 are also decent choices.</p>
<p>Another is to get a bi-fuel vehicle (gasoline and CNG), and run it on CNG whenever you can. There are hundreds of CNG stations nationwide.</p>
<p>Finally you can get an older diesel vehicle and run it on biodiesel. </p>
<p>I do not recommend getting a hydrogen fuel cell car.</p>
<p>See &#8220;Pump: The Move&#8221;, now out on iTunes and soon to come on Google Play, for more. Alternative fuel stations and cars can be found a search away. Or ask me for more information.</p>

Judaism and Christianity come from the same place. It is a problem because unlike Judaism and Christianity which have after centuries abandoned their primitive semitic barbarism, Islam has in 1300 not found a modus vivendi with the modern world and mind. Perhaps some day it will, but not soon. The Charlie Hebdo killings were executions for blasphemy. Until 1800 Christian states also killed blasphemers, as well as heretics, adulterers and witches. But Islam has not changed. We cannot fight Islam unless we understand what we are dealing with.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christianity&#8221; was always based around Reason, the kind of logic developed and written down by Greek philosophers such Socrates in 900BC. Islam completely rejected philosophy and reason Around 1100AD after Al-Ghazalis islamic treatise &#8220;the incoherence of the philosophers&#8221; entirely in favour of revelation. The Koranic jibberish is pretty much inconsistant with logic or sanity anyway.<br/>
This fundemental difference, reason based on Christs example and teachings versus revelation is Why islam can not progress. You can read about it in Neil&rsquo;s &#8220;closing of the muslim mind&#8221;. Worth it just for Roger Scruttons forward. </p>
<p>The preceding Pope, Benedict, in his Regensburg address warned we are in danger of dehellenisation. This current left wing nitwit Pope will hurry that on I fear.</p>
<p>Christs teachings were radical and fused well with Hellenic reason. Hence Christianity has always accepted progress, that reason can improve our understanding of God as well as the universe. Even I as an atheist accept that. </p>
<p>Many of the things held up as &#8220;bad&#8221; about western civilisation or christianity such as the crusades and inquisition were preceded by islamic Jihaads and inquisitions and were merely a neccesary response. I respect the right of Spain to kick out every last invading muslim even after 700 years of occupation given the misery, forced conversions and &#8220;civil war&#8221; they brought and for the ones who lied about conversion in order to stay to be given a warning,,as they were, and then dealt with.</p>
<p>It was exposure to Jihaad that hardened Christendom and turned it away from its pacifistic roots.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-701984" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The problem with Islam is that the Koran is not like the Old and New Testaments. The Jewish and Christian scriptures certainly claim authoritative status, but the Koran explicitly, specifically, and unmistakeably claims not only authoritative status, but also that it was dictated syllable by syllable from God, to an angel, to Mohammed, with no errors (Koran means &#8220;recitation&#8221; in Arabic). That&rsquo;s very different from the Christian idea of inspiration. It also says that Mohammed was the last prophet and revealed God&rsquo;s will perfectly. </p>
<p>This locks Islam into place. It can&rsquo;t be interpreted figuratively, or in the light of changing circumstances or scientific revelations or broader contact with the outside world. No one can come along and update it or alter it. Mohammed&rsquo;s way is the only way. Welcome to the seventh century. Your stay will be permanent.</p>

This is litterally equal to saving my child&rsquo;s or grand child&rsquo;s life. </p>
<p>It really isn&rsquo;t that expensive to develop substitutes, synthetics and alternatives to oil. Coal to Oil or or Natural Gas to Liquids is one. The shale oil revolution in the USA is another one. The Tesla S points to a possible complete replacement. Improving vehicle efficiency is another that has been very successful. Lots of countries survive without it and it seems to me that cheap oil just makes us sloppy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even possible to extract CO2 from the atmosphere, say in a NaOH solution, split of the CO2 via electrolysis or electrodialysis and to synthesis with electrolytic hydrogen fuels such as methanol, diesel or gasoline over catalysts. Several countries have experimented with this technology including Germany, Britain and USA. The USN considers it could replenish aircraft carriers aviation fuel. It would cost about $2.00/L or $8.40/gallon using wind power, less for nuclear.</p>
<p>White ingenuity can bypass cheap oil, it would have to be a Government program but if anything it will force down the price of the balance. Coal to Oil was viable at $50 barrel meaning it&rsquo;s viable now given the price but investors are put of by climate change politics and the realisation that the Saudis would simply drop their price.</p>

<p>But the most effective thing we can do is laid out by Dr. Robert Zubrin in his book &#8220;Energy Victory: Winning the War on Terror by Breaking Free from Oil&#8221;. He is definitely hostile to Islam, but is not one of &#8220;us&#8221;. That&rsquo;s fine, we don&rsquo;t need him to be. His plan is to simply make it a required feature in all new gasoline cars sold in America that they be fully flex fueled, able to run on any alcohol fuel such as (much maligned) ethanol and especially methanol with an M. The per car cost would be trivial, less than $130 per new car at the factory for automakers, at most, but the effects would be world-changing. Methanol is cheaper than gasoline without subsidies and even after adjusting for mileage. It is made most easily and cheaply from natural gas, which the USA has not only in abundance but CHEAP abundance (unlike oil). It can also be made from coal (more cheaply than coal-to-gasoline) and from any biomass. Alcohols are higher octane and cleaner burning as well. With flex fuel capability a standard feature like seat belts, within a few years there would be a critical mass of cars on the road compatible with alcohol fuel, and filling stations would find themselves racing each other to offer alcohol to avoid being undercut by their competitors. Suddenly drivers are no longer a helpless captive market forced to pay whatever price the oil cartel sets, the price of oil collapses forever, and the various strains of jihad suddenly lose much of their virulence.</p>

Not only the analyses of Nietzsche and Yeats are needed, but also their aristogenic recommendations. My letter has not been published.</p>

But admitting millions of Syrians would discriminate against all the other displaced peoples, asylum claimants and would-be immigrants from everywhere else. So why not let them all in? After all, England is not an English nation, but a &#8220;multicultural society&#8221;.</p>
<p>The previous (atheist) parish &#8220;priest&#8221; of our local &#8220;Church&#8221; of &#8220;England&#8221; said it would be a &#8220;good idea&#8221; for the navy to go and get all the unhappy people of the &#8220;third world&#8221; and bring them to Britain. &#8220;Wouldn&rsquo;t that affect our own living-standards?&#8221; said the churchward untutored in the PC etiquette. &#8220;What does that matter?&#8221; said the &#8220;Revd&#8221; Tony.</p>
