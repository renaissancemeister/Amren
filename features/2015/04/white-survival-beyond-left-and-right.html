<h1 class="title">White Survival: Beyond Left and Right</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, March 3, 2015</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
Conserving the American founding stock should be beyond politics.</div> 
</div> 



<p><em>Below is the talk Jared Taylor delivered at the National Policy Institute conference, hosted at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, February 27, 2015, followed by an audio recording.</em></p>
<p>The theme of this conference is &ldquo;beyond conservatism,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;d like to start with a few things that are beyond both conservatism and liberalism, that is to say, some things people agree on whatever their politics. What I am thinking of is related to conservatism since it has the same root. It is the idea of conserving or conservation.</p>
<p>There are some things that essentially all people-no matter what their politics-are conservative about. The planet, to begin with. There are probably some misanthropes who would like to blow it up, but most folks, across the political spectrum, want to conserve it.</p>
<p>Most people also want to keep the planet livable so we can conserve the people who live on it. Mark Twain used to say, &ldquo;Sometimes I&rsquo;d like to hang the whole human race, and finish the farce,&rdquo; but most of the time, people don&rsquo;t feel that harshly about our species.</p>
<p>And we want to conserve animals. We&rsquo;d be sorry to see giraffes or baboons die out.</p>
<p>Take the case of the Cuban crocodile. He&rsquo;s a relative of the American crocodile and said to be a noble beast. But the Cubans are interbreeding with the Americans and could be genetically swamped. As one scientist explains, &ldquo;the two crocodile species interbreeding may pose a major threat to Cuban crocodiles. In a worst-case scenario, one crocodile lineage can cause the extinction of another.&rdquo; Scientists are fretting about how to prevent this tragedy.</p>
<p>The United States government worries about conserving species you&rsquo;ve never heard of: the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle, the spruce-fir moss spider. If you buy land, and one of the turns up on it, you might not be able to develop it.</p>
<p>And most people want to conserve the different places where people live, and the different ways that people live in those places. We&rsquo;re happy for Uruguay or China to remain distinctive countries. We all want different languages and cultures to flourish. In that respect we&rsquo;re all conservative.</p>
<p>We are sad when the last speaker of an obscure language dies or when a distinctive way of life comes to an end. That&rsquo;s why Brazil now has an official policy of leaving untouched tribes alone if that&rsquo;s at all possible. People living in the stone age should have the choice of staying there if that&rsquo;s what they want.</p>
<p>Conserving these things literally does go &ldquo;beyond political conservatism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, there are things you are not allowed to want to conserve. Hardly anyone will oppose you if you say that the primitive tribes of New Guinea have the right to maintain their customs and their way of life, undisturbed by outsiders. But you better not say the same thing about the French or the Swedes.</p>
<p>If you say that the French have the right to keep their country Catholic and European, you&rsquo;re not a conservationist. You&rsquo;re a hatemonger. You&rsquo;re not beyond conservatism, you&rsquo;re beyond the pale.</p>
<p>According to current thinking, the French absolutely do not have the right to live undisturbed by outsiders. On the contrary, people from all over the world have the right to move there.</p>
<p>This is astonishing, really. I can&rsquo;t think of a single thing that New Guineans have contributed to the world. And yet their way of life will endure. That of the Europeans, who have immensely enriched the world, may not.</p>
<p>Not even conservatives argue that France is a distinctive biological and cultural entity that should be conserved. That&rsquo;s not the way we are supposed to think about white countries. Korea? Yes. Ghana? Pakistan? Paraguay? Fine. Those places, like all other non-white nations, have the right to maintain their identities and ways of life.</p>
<p>And what about conserving white people biologically? They are a small minority of the world population-7 or 8 percent-and some of them are breeding with other groups, just like the Cuban crocodile. But anyone who says maybe we should think about the long-term prospects of white people-like the way we do with the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle-is no longer a conservationist. He&rsquo;s a white supremacist.</p>
<p>And so there is not one politician in America, even among the ones who claim to be deeply conservative, who says he wants to conserve the founding stock of this country or who wants to conserve a majority-white United States.</p>
<p>The odd thing about all this is that it&rsquo;s the Lefties who act as if they had the corner on conservation. They love government power, and they love to boss us around for our own good in the name of the conserving the environment. Why aren&rsquo;t they all in a flutter about the prospects for white people exactly the way they are in a flutter about the ozone layer? I can see them browbeating us: &ldquo;Now, you white people have to live over here, and you have to marry among yourselves.&rdquo; &ldquo;Remember: it&rsquo;s for the children.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s just the busy-body sort of thing they love. Where&rsquo;s Hillary when we need her?</p>
<p>For most of the history of this country, of course, the idea of the United States as an explicitly white country was taken for granted: It was beyond debate, neither liberal nor conservative<em>. </em>It&rsquo;s well known that the very first immigration law, passed by the very first congress that was called after the ratification of the Constitution, restricted naturalization to &ldquo;free white persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until 1965, we had an immigration policy designed to keep the country European.</p>
<p>There is nothing about the idea of United States as a nation of Europeans that is inherently a Left-Right type of political question at all. It should be beyond politics, just like conserving the white rhino or keeping Japan Japanese.</p>
<p>The racial mix of the country is not logically implicated <em>at all</em> in the position you take on the size of the government, the welfare state, abortion, the role of women, homosexual marriage, income distribution, foreign policy, public prayer, how you interpret the Constitution, or any other political question.</p>
<p>You can believe in cradle-to-grave welfare <em>or</em> rugged individualism, but be in complete agreement on wanting to keep the country majority-white. Jack London, for example, was very active as a socialist, but was adamantly opposed to a multi-racial America.</p>
<p>So: Why would anyone want to conserve whites as a distinct people, and want them to remain a majority in the United States? First, these questions shouldn&rsquo;t even have to be answered. If the Navajo were dwindling in numbers or losing their culture, no one would say they didn&rsquo;t have the right to do something about it. No one would ever ask the Navajo: Why do you care about surviving as a people? Why not just fade away? If a white person asked those questions it would be the height of racism.</p>
<p>But for white people? It&rsquo;s the very opposite. The very desire to survive as a distinct people is &ldquo;hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remember the Cuban crocodile: &ldquo;In a worst-case scenario, one crocodile lineage can cause the extinction of another.&rdquo; Well, strictly as biological artifacts, white people are surely at least as valuable as Cuban crocodiles, if only for aesthetic reasons. And there&rsquo;s a lot more than that. Europeans created the modern world. Shouldn&rsquo;t they have the same rights as the tribes of the Amazon: to be left undisturbed?</p>
<p>These are objective questions, but, of course, there is also my own subjective view of white survival as a white person. Survival is the first law, and there is no more fundamental instinct than the desire to protect one&rsquo;s own kind and to want it to flourish.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obvious when we are talking about any group <em>but</em> whites.</p>
<p>The number of Hispanics is growing very quickly in this country, and Hispanics are ecstatic about this. It means their language, their culture, their physical type, their heritage, their aspirations are all gaining ground and could eventually dominate the United States. Hispanics want this very much, and they consistently try to change laws and policies to increase their numbers, and benefit their people. This is considered a sign of healthy collective pride.</p>
<p>But if whites tried to delay their dispossession, if whites proposed steps to maintain their majority status, that would be hate and bigotry. Why? The processes are perfectly symmetrical. The percentage of Hispanics increases as the percentage of whites decreases. Why is it right for Hispanics to celebrate their gains but wrong for whites to regret their losses?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I make no secret of my view on this. My ancestors have been white for tens of thousands of years. My children are white and I want my grandchildren to be white. I like the culture of Europe, I prefer the society that whites create. What&rsquo;s wrong with that?</p>
<p>Well, guess what? Even though they don&rsquo;t admit it, almost all whites feel the same way I do.</p>
<p>Look at what they do, not what they say. Where do they live? Who are their friends? Who do they invite over for dinner? If you ask a white person to name a single non-white neighborhood he&rsquo;d like to live in, or a single non-white school he&rsquo;d want to send his children to, you get a blank.</p>
<p>Whites know in their bones that a non-white America is not the country they want for themselves or for their children. That is why, when the part of America in which they live becomes an outpost of Africa or Mexico, they move away-to some place where whites are still the majority. And most white people still want their children to marry other whites.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Abandoned.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113988" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Abandoned.jpg" alt="Abandoned" width="550" height="353" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Abandoned.jpg 550w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Abandoned-300x193.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"/></a></p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t dare say these things openly. They don&rsquo;t even admit these things to themselves. But look at how they behave-and Lefties are no different from anyone else. As Joseph Sobran used to put it, &ldquo;in their mating and migratory habits, you can&rsquo;t tell a liberal from a Klansman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the hippies used to say, white people just need to get in touch with their feelings.</p>
<p>Whites used to be entirely honest about their feelings, and there is no doubt that people who call themselves conservative were honest for longer than lefties were.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, William F. Buckley&rsquo;s <a href="#cover"><em>National Review</em></a> supported apartheid in South Africa, and said that an immigration policy designed to keep the country white &ldquo;requires no justification.&rdquo; Preserving a white America was a goal so obviously legitimate that it didn&rsquo;t have to be justified. It was &ldquo;beyond conservatism&rdquo; and &ldquo;beyond liberalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>National Review </em>doesn&rsquo;t take that position now. It would banish anyone who did to the outer darkness of VDARE.com. And that&rsquo;s just one of the countless positions that conservatism has simply abandoned.</p>
<p>Take Martin Luther King. In the 1960s <em>National Review</em> called him a &ldquo;rabble-rousing demagogue.&rdquo; It said that the expression &ldquo;civil rights movement&rdquo; was ludicrous and should instead be called &ldquo;the Negro revolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, 50 years later, conservatives quote King as if he were a moral authority. Whenever they want to argue against racial preferences for non-whites they quote King&rsquo;s line about judging people on the content of their character. And yet, by the time King died he was open and explicit about wanting race preferences and quota hiring for blacks.</p>
<p>So, why do conservatives quote the words of a plagiarist, adulterer, communist sympathizer, whom contemporary conservatives called a &ldquo;rabble rouser&rdquo;?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they have completely swallowed the leftist view that whites have no racial legitimacy. Conservatives can&rsquo;t just say plainly that affirmative action discriminates against whites. They have to borrow the moral authority of a black person to say that. And that&rsquo;s why they quote the &ldquo;content of their character&rdquo; line, which King didn&rsquo;t even believe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to think of a more contemptible mental capitulation.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, <em>National Review</em> said that the desire to keep America white &ldquo;requires no justification.&rdquo; Well, whites never did come up with a justification. That&rsquo;s a big part of the problem. They never articulated moral reasons to justify their own survival. For hundreds of years-thousands of years-whites, like everybody else, never had to. They just took survival for granted as a legitimate goal.</p>
<p>But now, it means whites have no stock of tested ideas and arguments that they can draw on to justify survival. They have a deep foreboding about what is happening, but they don&rsquo;t have words to express that foreboding. Without words, without convincing moral foundations, whites cannot act.</p>
<p>And that is what makes whites different from everyone else and what makes them uniquely vulnerable. Non-white immigrants don&rsquo;t have to justify their conquest of the United States. They don&rsquo;t have to explain why they want their numbers to grow at our expense. They know instinctively that it&rsquo;s good for them, and that is all they need to know.</p>
<p>The same is true for Third-World immigrants to Europe. They don&rsquo;t have to justify conquest. No, it is Europeans who would have to justify even the most basic steps necessary to assure their survival.</p>
<p>It should be no more necessary to explain why whites have the right to a future than to explain why it is better to live than to die. But that is the dilemma we face. Slowly, slowly, both in America and in Europe, we are waking up to this dilemma.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-752677" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Mr. Taylor has written a strong piece regarding our dilemma. When I see white males with Asian or Mexican wives, I am acutely aware that a gene line that goes back thousands of years has been destroyed when there are children involved. Ditto the white female with the nonwhite male. You&rsquo;d think that mothers might want their children to look like themselves, but no.</p>
<p>Not until we embrace our right to exist and lose our fear of the word &#8220;racist&#8221; will be be able to articulate openly the feelings of doom we experience. What is puzzling is how so many in government, including white politicians, have come to betray us. I believe that money talks and that economics is driving the push to turn the US nonwhite. We pesky whites demanding our rights and our unions and our nice suburbs are the primary force creating the middle class.</p>
<p>The power elites want all the wealth for themselves, so death to the middle class also means death to the white race.</p>

Sure, sure, sure, 99% White would be paradise but this is earth, you know, quite a black iron prison no matter how spiffy we make it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m typical of a former Marxist (&#8220;Progressive&#8221;). We (former) Marxists figgered it would all fall into place long time ago, found out it wouldn&rsquo;t, made race a social construct, waged war on the &#8220;caste&#8221; (class) known as &#8220;White Folk&#8221;.</p>
<p>Because Marxism needs someone to blame for &#8220;all the problems&#8221;, even for the weather. That someone must be a person, preferably a &#8220;class&#8221; of people, who are the cause of all the problems, all the misery, of the poor good people. The White Marxist worm at some point totally commits himself to the evil impetus toward totalitarian &#8220;goodism&#8221;. Atheist or agnostic or &#8220;Universalist&#8221; hippy dude from Galilee style Xtian, he closes his eyes when convenient and repeats the soothing mantras. All misfortune is unnatural, all people are the results of nothing but their environment, all bad things are caused by bad people. Who can be sued, who can be made to pay&hellip;</p>
<p>For all the good stuff, agin&rsquo; all the bad stuff. The most abominably wicked mental illness there is. Thank God for my dark enlightenment.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-767067" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Feminism will be turned inside out for you, too.</p>
<p>I will explain it: patriarchal mating behaviors are seen even in apes. There are laws of attraction in the human species, and one of these is that women are attracted to strong provider-type males. </p>
<p>Women will never have the same &#8220;power&#8221; as men because of this simple fact. They can make millions of dollars leading companies, they can be doctors far more often than men, they can make scientific discoveries, they can bodybuild and become army rangers. </p>
<p>But when the time comes to get a mate, they have to sit back and wait. If they try to take initiative over the mating process and start hitting on down-on-their-luck men, paying their husband&rsquo;s bills, having him be a stay-at-home dad, women will simply stop feeling attraction for the man. This is because strong, provider-type males are attractive to women, while weak beta or omega males are not attractive. Women are not likely to go out of their way for men who are unattractive to them; they would rather complain that there are &#8220;not enough good men left.&#8221; So women are forever the &#8220;objects&#8221; in the mating process, waiting for a man to come along to &#8220;prove&#8221; himself by initiating the conversation, asking her out, buying her the ring, paying the bills and being the man.</p>
<p>It is a part of nature, neither good nor evil. There are things we can control, and things we can&rsquo;t. Feminism is a dead end. It is futile. It is against our nature. That is why there was never a feminist civilization.</p>

<p>I am not trying to be depressing or sexist, I am just illustrating a fact that is undeniable.</p>
<p>Men have obstacles and limits to our sexual power as well. The gender roles are different, not unequal.</p>
<p>The reason I think this fact dismantles feminism is because 99% of straight gender issues are really issues of sexual empowerment. Feminists want to have power, but specifically sexual power. </p>
<p>That is why male feminists do not really comfort and please the feminist women. These guys are unanimously unattractive males that the women don&rsquo;t want, so the fact that they care about &#8220;equality&#8221; does not matter. They offer women no more sexual empowerment over quality males.</p>
<p>If an attractive, intelligent male with a positive attitude went to feminist groups and asked the girls out on dates, the girls would chill out and their psychological problems would heal a little it.</p>
<p>I could go further and present an argument for traditionalism, but this is not the time nor place.</p>

<p>interesting.<br/>
I believe that in the broad scheme of things the social pendulum tends to swing, eventually.<br/>
Perhaps what you describe will begin to happen when women realize that endless amounts of empty sex, porn style, without loving commitment does not create a very happy life for them.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-768801" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I am not totally convinced that traditionalism is a good idea in the 21st century, because I believe women are better suited for 21st century work, and probably also smarter (damn the IQ &#8220;standard deviation&#8221; arguments). Basically, I&rsquo;d say humans are maladapted for the 21st century in some ways (not super important, though).</p>
<p>But I understand the arguments for traditionalism:</p>
<p>Since men have to be the pursuers, and since men and women instinctively know the males must perform the role of &#8220;strong provider,&#8221; the best way to have high birthrates <b>and</b> the number of adults with satisfying sex lives (pretty important for a satisfying, stable social life) is to maximize the number of males who have a position in society that allows them to make enough money and earn enough respect to be considered &#8220;strong providers.&#8221; That way, they will be in a position to pursue and marry women, and actually become providers for children.</p>
<p>Now, mind you, I am not raving about crazy theoretical concepts that do not show up in the real world. These are corroborated by facts about the millennial generation in America: less than half of marriageable-aged millennials are married. The average age for Americans to have a first marriage is going up, overall marriage rates are going down. Births out of wedlock are a big thing in feminist nordic European countries, even ones with good economies. </p>
<p>Why are birthrates important? If a society does not produce enough children, it will eventually get outcompeted by one that is fecund. This is happening in America, where non-patriarchal whites are naturally getting swamped by ultra-patriarchal hispanics. In Europe, feminist whites are getting swamped by ultra-patriarchal Muslims. This is probably the reason feminist civilizations do not really show up in the historical records. If people ever decided to go feminist, they would get destroyed by either conquest or genetic drift.</p>
<p>Another way to maximize birthrates without enforcing a patriarchy is to allow polygamy. That way, women could make up 90% of the professions, and the 10% of professionals who are male will just have a lot of wives. If the remaining men are noncompetitive and sedate, then the society will be stable, and enough children will be made.</p>
<p>However, what will happen in a few generations is that the most <b>competitive</b> males will end up being the successful ones (because this trait has great effect on life success), which means that in a few more generations, humanity will evolve to be much more competitive. This is why the polygamous Arab people and the formerly polygamous Chinese are such competitive people, imo. </p>
<p>Once the men become competitive, they branch off into one of two directions. The first is that the loser 80% of males will gang up and hold the top 20% down so they can have a chance to pass on their genes and not lose out in life. This is probably how the tradition of monogamy evolves. The second optioin is that the society as a whole could go to hell, involving war and incest for the loser males. War is obviously bad; incest is less obviously bad, but it is actually very dysgenic, which is dangerous long-term. This is the middle east in a nutshell. </p>
<p>So polygamy either puts you back into square one or it ruins your society.</p>
<p>Blacks are in a similar but different situation, but they don&rsquo;t count here because they are<br/>
not <i>homo sapiens</i>, they are what I call <i>homo<br/>
scatapultus</i>: poo-flinging man. They have completely different mating behaviors,<br/>
which cannot be replicated by people in the species <i>homo<br/>
sapiens</i>, because these mating patterns seem essentially alien<br/>
and crazy to members of the species <i>homo sapiens</i>.</p>
<p>I would argue for radically closed borders which can allow our people/tribe to survive the low birth rates that follow from women&rsquo;s empowerment. We need less human on earth anyways. And ultimately, we might need to think about having the government intervene in radical ways to make sure children are being produced if the birth rates become too serious a problem (Encourage married people to have more kids, raise some kids with by the state, force people to marry for certain jobs and positions).</p>

While young women were exhorted to become as loose and carefree as males, the biology is still valid, men don&rsquo;t get pregnant. Now, several decades into the fray, with a bevy of babies from different fathers, what is increasingly found on CL by lonely females? Looking for just a date, to see a movie or eat. No sex! No FWB, no hookup!! Looking for a gentleman. There are no gentlemen any more after being told endlessly they were archaic and useless. The end has been found but it may be too late in the grand scheme of things!</p>

The earth&rsquo;s optimal population size is 1 billion to 3 billion, earth resource is not sufficient to support 7 billion or more people. When resources are not enough, people tend to start conflicts and white people are ones of finest human beings so if competition happened, chances are other low IQ race will fail and their number will reduce. Besides having more children, a healthy mindset of white race is essential.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-753460" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Looks like a few trolls went on a trolling spree in this thread. The fact that this thread has attracted so many trolls tells you all you need to know: we need more material like this. If an article gets many trolls, then you must be doing something terribly right. One troll indignantly asked: &ldquo;Why do you think whites will go extinct?&rdquo; Before I will answer the question, let me rephrase it to: &ldquo;Why are whites being threatened?&rdquo; which is a better question to start from. </p>
<p>My native language, Cantonese, has well over 70 million speakers. It dwarfs most of the world&rsquo;s languages. You might therefore say that it is in no danger of disappearing. However, that is wrong. You have to see the situation of my language in context. It is spoken in a country with a national language which is spoken by more than a billion people. The speakers of my language and the people of my culture are utterly outnumbered. Our culture and language will probably have gone practically extinct by 2100. You might object to this idea saying that there might be more speakers of Cantonese than ever before. If there are more speakers of Cantonese than ever before, it does not make a difference; we still have to see the size of my language in context. It will not change that we are utterly outnumbered. My language which is inherently linked to my particular culture is under an existential threat in the lands where it used to be indigenous. Any language and culture can die if the people are threatened or if they are being forced into using another language or assimilating into another culture for economical or other reasons. I feel much sympathy and empathy for the cause of the survival of whites, because I can understand every detail of their cause from this perspective. While I am currently unable to save my own language and culture, I do know what whites face is real, and that is why I support them. I do not want them to go extinct like my own culture and language. </p>
<p>Whites have more than 700 million people. Most would think that this is a huge number of people. However, things have to be seen in context. Whites live on a planet with over 7 billion people, and many of those people want to come live in their countries. Whites are facing unprecented migratory trends towards their countries, and this is an existential threat for a group of people that is outnumbered by the population of the rest of the world. Whites, like my native language and culture, might be practically extinct as early as 2100 or as late as 2200. So, my take is that their practical extinction (i.e., point of no return) will take place within that timeframe. You might object to this idea saying that there are more Whites than ever before. Again, this does not matter. The size of the white population has to be seen in context. The fact is that whites are utterly outnumbered. Whites who as a race of people are inherently linked to Western civilisation are now under an existential threat in the lands that they traditionally inhabitated, even on their continent of origin. Any civilisation can die when its people are being threatened. Whatever may be said in favour of increasing the quality of a population, it is still a fact that quantity does matter. </p>
<p>I recommend that people who are interested in Western civilisation should buy and read Prof. Ricardo Duchesne&rsquo;s 2012 book &ldquo;The uniqueness of Western Civilization.&rdquo;</p>

<p>See my &#8220;Threefold Compact&#8221; below regarding parents and their kids vis-à-vis out-marrying. </p>
<p>Parents may not be able to tell their kids who they can and cannot marry, but&hellip;</p>
<p>1. Parents can raise their children to understand and accept the parents&rsquo; beliefs. </p>
<p>2. Parents can disown, shun, and disinherit whatever child they choose for whatever reason. Including marriage to someone unacceptable to the parents.</p>
<p>For truly grief stricken parents (at the loss of a child - &#8220;You are dead to us&#8221;) I suggest finding a struggling young White family and following a grand old Roman tradition - adult adoption. Help and mentor and invite to family get-togethers a struggling young White couple to fill the void and assure more Whites will be in this world, healthy and strong.</p>
<p>I personally know a lot of White/Oriental folks who, and whose 3/4 White kids, I have no problems with at all, by the way. The choice of who is or is not acceptable to parents is the business and affair of the parents alone. </p>
<p>In an America roughly 80% White, 15% productive non-White, 5% gene-scum, a pretty Chinese Nationalist Maiden here, a talented high Mestizo there, a high achieving swarthy-but-Caucasian Sikh - in an America where Whites were numerically in control and respected, I would not fear at all a trickle of outside genetics since such would make our White mongrel population no less White in the big picture.</p>

<p>I have much empathy for the Asian peoples who will be the next in line for the Great Death that multiculturalism brings, after we whites disappear.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s resolve for monoculturalism and monoracialism already seems to be wearing down. The anime that is most popular for my generation (last time I checked), called Naruto, has some strong multicultural themes in it, even with a black ninja village. If Japan opens borders, the third-worlders will certainly pour in (along with socially awkward whites). Japan has not had hardly any crime in a long time, but that will change for the worse. Since Japan is just a little bit ahead of the rest of Asia, the same will happen to China.</p>
<p>You simply cannot keep up with Africans in the game of reproduction. Our white ancestors noticed the senselessly high fecundity of blacks a long time ago. Their numbers are potentially infinite.</p>
<p>I am not trying to downplay the issue of the death of the Cantonese language. If you cannot win this battle against the multiculturalists, you will have a hard time finding the ideological and intellectual firepower to resist the next multicultural reform. This battle must be won so that you can know how to win the next battles.</p>

Often the children of such unions are very unhappy, with high rates of drug abuse, depression and even suicidality. To quote Jared Taylor&rsquo;s book White Identity, &#8220;A study of White/Asian children found that they were twice as likely as mono-racial children-34 percent vs. 17 percent-to suffer from psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression or drug abuse.&#8221; He cites several other studies to the effect that people who have a clear racial identity are more mentally healthy than those who do not.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-753184" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>White Identity was published in 2011. Here are some more quotes from page 124:</p>
<p>&#8220;A 2003 study of 90,000 middle-school and high-school students found that black/white mixed-race children had more health and psychological problems than children who were either black or white. They were more likely to be depressed, sleep badly, skip school, smoke, drink, consider suicide, and have sex. White/Asian children showed similar symptoms. The principal author conclude that the cause was &#8220;the struggle with identity formation, leading to lack of self-esteem, social isolation and problems of family dynamics in biracial households.<br/>
&#8220;The authors of a 2008 study reached the same conclusion: &#8220;When it comes to engaging in risky/anti-social adolescent behavior, however, mixed race adolescents are stark outliers compared to both blacks and whites. &hellip; Mixed race adolescents-not having a natural peer groups-need to engage in more risky behaviors to be accepted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are the citations given in the book for the above two, respectively:</p>
<p>Connie Cass, &#8220;Study: Mixed-Race Youth Have Health Woes,&#8221; Associated Press, Oct. 30, 2003.<br/>
Roland G. Fryer et al., &#8220;The Plight of Mixed Race Adolescents,&#8221; National Bureau of Economic Research, NBER Working Paper No. 14192, July, 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yoonsun Choi of the University of Chicago found that in Seattle middle schools, a clear racial identity seemed to protect against certain problems. Bi-racial children were the group most likely to smoke, take drugs, have been in fights, hurt someone badly, or carry a gun. Prof. Choi believes mixed-race children suffer because no racial group accepts them. &#8220;there is some indication that a strong ethnic identity helps protect kids from these [undesirable] behaviors,&#8221; she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe I am not supposed to post links here but you can look up Yoonsun Choi; she has been involved in more than one study (including one in 2010) to the same effect. I believe the above (again from White Identity) is referring to this:</p>
<p>Are multiracial adolescents at greater risk? Comparisons of rates, patterns, and correlates of substance use and violence between monoracial and multiracial adolescents.<br/>
Choi, Yoonsun; Harachi, Tracy W.; Gillmore, Mary Rogers; Catalano, Richard F.<br/>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say for the sake of argument it is all society&rsquo;s fault. Which do you think an individual has more control over: long-term trends in society around them, or their own behavior in terms of choosing mates (for marriage) of their own or different races? I think it is always a better idea to try to control your own behavior and consider the likely consequences of it given current realities rather than assuming that you or anyone else will be able to effect fundamental changes in society.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-753577" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Blaming society is so easy as usual.</p>
<p>(Paraphrasing)<br/>
The evidence shows that even though society is more accepting and endorsing of mixed marriages and children than ever before, the associated health problems of men, women (the incidence of<br/>
spousal homicide is 7.7 times higher in interracial marriages compared to intraracial marriages and each parent shares more common DNA with a random person of his race than with his own child) and children caught up in this racial mixing has continued to increase, not decrease. </p>
<p>By the logic of pro-diversity activist, smokers became inflicted with lung cancer, heart disease, etc, due to &ldquo;smokophobia&rdquo; or people&rsquo;s social stigma on smoking, rather than the smoking itself. But that, in a nutshell, describes the manipulation of the pro-diversity activist movement (and any similar movement.)</p>
<p>Beside the fact that scientists today are as much brainwashed as anybody and that not many are interested researching controversial issues.</p>
<p>Also, there are some bi-racial children who speak up (look in youtube) but not many: one of the worst parts of abuse is society&rsquo;s refusal to see an injustice. Emotional abuse is particularly difficult because it is invisible and therefore ripe for denial. Moreover when praised by everyone in the vicinity as cool, better than normal and no cause to be aggrieved (even worse, a reason to be grateful), the natural instinct of the child is to blame herself for revealing their insecurities, for choosing one parent to the other, their lack of identity or desperate/emotional search for an identity etc. </p>
<p>I am not saying that mixed races parents are automatically guilty of any kind of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse to the children they raise. Nor am I saying they are less likely to take good care of children. What I mean is this: mixed races parents give mixed identities and so no identity. To intentionally deprive any child of an heritage and identity has become in itself a form of abuse for me.</p>

I got a story for ya though.

didn&rsquo;t scar him or anything, but I can imagine if we was actually inter-racial, that might have an effect on him. and it might continue his entire childhood.</p>

I was blabbing about how most modern &#8220;feminism&#8221; is axe grinding Marxist harridanry, that the vast majority of university feminists are gyno-Marxist abominations who want for all women not what all women want for themselves, but what Marxist Harridanry wants for all women.<br/>

<p>Sometimes (most times these days) I see a long cascading debate or something &#8220;like as such&#8221; to quote a former Miss Souf Krakalaka&hellip;</p>
<p>I just let &rsquo;em go at it. I don&rsquo;t have to break up fights. Let &rsquo;em rumble. The mod&rsquo;s OK with it, must be OK, you know? </p>
<p>When I was a crazed Marxist I used to love to pick troll fights, get mean and show people I was smarter than they, destroy the enemy. Chaos, conflict, bloodletting reduced to words. My great Marxist messianic duty, you know?</p>
<p>Some of that carried over into my post dark enlightenment phase, of course, and I&rsquo;ve had some fun here and there, of course. I no longer feel guilt for being bad and evil, you know, lol?</p>
<p>But I really feel like I&rsquo;m at he end of a long metamorphosis from slimy, crazy, weak, whiney, blamey, wormy &#8220;progressive&#8221; (American Marxist), to whatever the Hell I am now. This tooth extraction seems to have dislodged something, and now I&rsquo;m free, an ideological butterfly - no longer a Marxist worm.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just Spring. Upon further reflection, my friend may have just changed phone service. Her life was a stable continual series of crises involving her and her girls, which always seemed to work out, and it&rsquo;s more than possible one of these crises involved the changing of cell phone service. She was dating a private dick, though, last time we talked&hellip;hmmm&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>cultures and genetics are two different things.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not entirely, no - not in the sense you&rsquo;re suggesting. Culture does NOT produce people; people produce culture. That is a monumentally important thing to <em>truly</em> grasp. If you don&rsquo;t, you will always put the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>If a group of people from a particular genetic stock produce the same sort of culture over and over and over again every time they group together in sufficient numbers, what does that tell you?</p>
<p>1) The culture they produce is partially based on genes that influence what sort of people they are <em>as a group.</em><br/>
2) If you wipe out the genetics of those people, that type of culture will vanish from the earth because no one else is like them <em>as a group.</em></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t difficult. Stop thinking of &#8220;culture&#8221; as some mysterious thing which is plucked from the ether solely by virtue of hazy concepts like &#8220;where you live.&#8221; Two different peoples plunked down in the same environment would not produce the same culture.</p>

<p>Nope. Find me an example of this in history. Find me an example of a country totally changing genetic stock and yet maintaining the very same culture as before.</p>
<blockquote><p>a black person can be more western, having growing up in the west, then a white person who has grown up in Africa.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nope. All of our PROBLEMS with black people in the West stem from how very non-Western they are by nature. When they <em>are</em> successful in the Western world, the level of their success generally correlates VERY well to how much that individual person is genetically like white people.</p>

I&rsquo;m pointing out the fact that a race of people were allowed to physically separate and even financed by this government to do so. I&rsquo;m also pointing out the fact that people like yourself have no problem with this when the darker races are allowed, and even encouraged to separate but then condemn and ridicule White&rsquo;s who wish to do the same.

In the 1990&rsquo;s the sport of mixed martial arts was banned in this country and the promoters of the UFC had no place to stage a show. UFC owners contacted an Indian tribe and were allowed to have a PPV produced at a gaming casino which was not bound by federal laws. On most, if not all tribal lands you have to furnish proof that you&rsquo;re at least part Indian, or married to one, to be able to live/own Indian land within the United States. They set their own laws and promote their own agenda without interference from outside groups. They&rsquo;re not bound by affirmative action, housing, employment or even our hunting and fishing laws. But people like yourself want to deny White&rsquo;s that same right. If I wanted to purchase 100 acres and build a subdivision for White&rsquo;s only I would be taken to jail at the point of a gun.

<p>&#8220;Indian land within the United States.&#8221; obviously they are not part of the united states or they wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to host the UFC. they are considered different &#8216;nations&rsquo;. your comparison doesn&rsquo;t hold water. but if you want to go the way of the Indian, declare war on the American government. maybe you can get your own reservation. it might only be 10X10. but hey, it&rsquo;s a start.</p>

I was pointing out the hypocrisy of people like yourself condemning all of us &#8220;White racists&#8221; and &#8220;Naatzee&rsquo;s&#8221; while ignoring other races that have actively separated themselves. I guess this is a little over your head.</p>

<p>I believe you comparison to American Indians, &#8220;actively separated themselves&#8221; is a false premise. they were forced onto reservations and there are less than 3 million in America I believe. that would hardly equate to the 200 million white americans. plus the tiny, tiny, tiny bit of land that may be reserved for indian ownership only, is insignificant and irrelevant to your wish to discriminate against blacks and others.</p>

Griggs Power decision, the civil rights act of 1991 all put the burden of proving that a test is not discriminatory against protected groups on the shoulders of the business/property owners. We shouldnt assume that business owners are an especially malicious group of people, that their motives forever be questioned. When the civil rights movement was founded it originally was not supposed to allow quotas because the detractors of it believed that quotas were a form of discrimination that could be at least as bad as the problems they were attempting to remedy. Then the civil rights leaders demanded quotas after the act was passed.</p>

I agree, things shouldn&rsquo;t &#8216;forever&rsquo; be questioned, but it looks like that most certainly should have been. here is the problem, whites have shown a willingness to be a &#8216;malicious group&rsquo; when it comes to blacks. therefore the pendulum has swung to far to protect them. I am against all affirmative action, whether for blacks or women. but the solution isn&rsquo;t to expand the program to allow whites to discriminate.<br/>
of course and organization isn&rsquo;t a transgression in and of its self. no one in their right mind would say so. but the means of attaining the &#8216;well-being&rsquo; can certainly be a transgression.</p>

By not allowing them preferential treatment in organizations that they had no hand in creating? Usually the oppressed attempt to get away from their oppressors.

<p>In the case of Duke Power, IIRC, they judged applicants using IQ tests, as was the custom among the majority of US businesses at the time. This was a good thing, as it allowed them to predict the performance of the potential employees. IQ tests still have high predictive validity today. Judging people based on something which is proven to be reliable in predicting their performance isn&rsquo;t oppression. The objection (which the court upheld) was basically that Blacks, unlike Whites, should be given jobs even when the employer has a good reason to think that they will not perform well in those jobs. This is the attitude which I believe all of us on this site are disgusted by.</p>

The civil rights leaders demanded a quota system which they got. Since blacks are a protected class and protected by quotas why does it matter how well they do? How could anyone possibly make such a determination and what would be their criterion? Either private property, liberty of contract and freedom of association are sacrosanct principals or they are not.</p>

Detroit died because social engineers thought they could interfere with these principals with no social recourse. People do not build organizations on social justice principles or to satisfy historical grievances however legitimate they do them mostly so they can have families and pass on wealth to their own children.

not sure what any of this has to do with anything.</p>

so Indians were not corralled into reservations? they weren&rsquo;t penned? they vacated their table in the middle of the restaurant for one by the kitchen?<br/>
of course it logically follows. your argument is about the word reservation being a positive thing, while in fact it is being misused to label something that is bad, as if it is positive.</p>

<p>I am less committed to a white North America.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-753857" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>No, the reasons are complicated. In the UK the political class certainly pushed &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; legislation at the behest of various minority lobbies, including the Board of Deputies of British Jews (this is fully documented) probably in the latter case because the most vigorous KBW agitation came from neonazi groups. There were token efforts to limit immigration, but there was an agreement by the main parties not to make it an election while simultaneously pro-immigration groups were agenda-networking in education, the media and some political parties like the Liberals and Labour Left, with a gradual upwards and outwards success which has made &#8220;equality and diversity&#8221; the official ideology of the &#8220;multicultural society&#8221; which has replaced the English nation, now reinforced by incremental legislation and police action against dissidents. Comparable forces have been at work in other EU countries, as in Canada and to some degree in the USA itself. In the mid-1980s we were falsely assured in Parliament that immigration had virtually ended, but in fact by various means and for various reasons it has exploded, with millions deliberately brought in during the Blair years to change the nature of society permanently (also documented), From the 1950s to the present opinion polls in Britain have expressed concern and opposition to immigration, but it continues with the support of business interests on one hand and PC ideologists on the other.</p>

so that is a yes on segregation and a no on dictatorship? got it. so how is this segregation going to work. is it by neighborhood and city or by state or country?

One form of freedom is being able to do what you wish with property that you purchase - as long as it does not endanger anyone else. My purchase of 100 acres and opening a White&rsquo;s only theme park is freedom. People like yourself would deny me that right even though I am harming no one. Egalitarians, like yourself, only want to allow your limited version of freedom and then ridicule and scorn people who disagree.</p>

<p>This is a very important point. I was taught in school that a duty toward other races called the White Man&rsquo;s Burden was an outdated 19th century attitude, but today many people seem fanatically in favor of it. Why should we interfere in other cultures, regardless of our intentions? Would we want them to try to &#8220;uplift&#8221; us? Even on Star Trek, a show which was full of pro-diversity material, they expressed this attitude as the Prime Directive. Do people now consider Star Trek racist?</p>

<p>Yes, not one. You nailed it right there. This will have to be overcome, and I believe it will be. The only question for me is how much suffering/diversity will be required before we make our stand.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there are different types of people - some concerned with their physical structure, from hair color and eye color to even skull shape I would presume; and, others who would rather share an understanding of the world around them regardless of physical attributes; and, yet others who would prefer to preserve whatever institutions might be important to them - history, philosophy, religion, etc. I certainly understand that people gravitate toward those that they consider &#8220;like&#8221;; yet, not to sound too relativistic, that &#8220;like may know like&#8221; takes many different forms - physical, cultural, ethnic, ideological, spiritual, etc.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t mind anyone preserving who &#8220;they&#8221; are, real or perceived. The interjection of hatred and discrimination, especially through politics, is what can get to me.</p>

Conservation is NOT a universal good. No one wants to conserve castrati performances or, more recently, film photography &#8216;for it&rsquo;s own sake&rsquo;- it is very expensive in many ways. They do not teach phlogiston theory in college to expand your mind to other possibilities. If the western white way of life is not fit, I will not cry. It IS fit, we are making a mistake in egalitarianism in particular and altering our environment based on that mistake. By the time we collectively realize that mistake for what it is, it make be too late to reverse.</p>

<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong again, but you are saying that if Western society is not good enough, then it SHOULD be replaced by an improved version&hellip;? And our mistake here is that there is no improved version to replace it with?</p>
<p>I guess I would ask how we determine fitness in this case. Why would we not argue, for example, that hunter-gatherers are more &#8220;fit&#8221; because they come into conflict with the rest of the natural world less often?</p>

I&rsquo;d be interested in a link if you have one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what &#8216;good enough&rsquo; means. I like the west, but I&rsquo;m biased, it&rsquo;s MY culture. Fit, as used in the evolutionary context, is value free and simply means thriving or at the very least surviving in an ecology. Whites can dominate any environment on earth and can survive in space. We are earth&rsquo;s apex predator. We have developed technologies for coping with all climates. Tsunamis, earthquakes, tornadoes are dealt with, not mastered, true. But these are all local events. There is no question that whites are &#8216;fit&rsquo;. We will not lose out to other subspecies in an evolutionary struggle for a niche because they are more fit than we are. </p>
<p>Our mistake is egalitarianism, charity, and a failure to understand that it requires WORK to keep entropy at bay. Remove whites and the world becomes Hobbesian in short order, except for the prehistoric isolated tribes. Witness Zimbabwe and South Africa. Or the Chinese harvesting organs from prisoners while they are still alive or selling each other baby formula that is simply chalk water from which infants die.</p>
<p>Nothing last forever. There is no reason why whites or the west should last forever. So I reject that kind of argument. But there is absolutely no reason why we should be committing suicide right now either. That&rsquo;s the argument to make, as I see it.</p>
<p>I hope that explains my position. Thank you for asking about it</p>

<p> You clearly wish to preserve that which you call your own. Most folks do. In my view, &#8220;Your own&#8221;, or &#8220;Our own&#8221;, or &#8220;Their own&#8221; is largely a matter of perspective, which you don&rsquo;t seem to wish to permit definition by individual determination. Rugged individualism is but a memory - nonetheless, some of us still live by that notion - if only because we reject the herd, those that might drag us further into the depths of shortsightedness. I am not a crocodile - nor, as an American, am I pure white. I do trust that you wish not to incite some sort of whack race war; however, some of your followers are so impassioned that they, themselves, just might not mind such an event - but, rather that they&rsquo;d invite it. How can we parse here? To each his own? DNA is king. Let us all just place our seeds where we wish to place them. Conservation concerns many. Let the many do their thing. Those who might be more concerned with paternal or maternal, or even autosomal, DNA - why not let them do their own thing without governance? Just a simple question for you.</p>
<p> Thanks.</p>

but anyways, when America was declare in 1776 how many white do you think were on the continent?<br/>
so if it was an extension of Europe, why does Europe get to extend? there were people already here. should the go extinct? you know, the Navajos? I&rsquo;m in Florida, there are only like 12,000 Seminoles left. do you hear them crying about racial genocide?</p>

Color/melanin content don&rsquo;t mean anything by themselves, but the traits necessary for the development of civilization are shared to a greater extent among the less-pigmented peoples of the Earth, like Asians and whites.

<p>And therein lies your lack of understanding. For you, race is merely a social construct, nations are merely social arrangements in which to conduct business at maximum profit. You have no racial identity other than the &#8220;human race.&#8221; All people are basically interchangeable and all differences can be ironed out by simple discussion. Right. The brainwashing is deep. Hang around awhile, try not to offend the regulars, and with time, you might find yourself enlightened by the reality of racial truths.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-767162" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There are a few issues:</p>
<p>1. Cultural. Multiculturalism causes a massive death in culture. For example, Asians in America simply cannot seriously celebrate their holidays, such as Chinese New Year, without feeling dumb. Likewise, whites do not really even talk about Easter anymore.</p>
<p>The loss of culture means the loss of many cultural activities, which means the loss of happiness. It seems to me that different races have different emotionalities, which means that you simply cannot get any old white person to start acting like black people and expect them to like it. It is not the way we are. It seems that cultures which organically arise in genetically similar people are best at making the people happy, whereas any &#8220;culture&#8221; that arises (though this doesn&rsquo;t happen) in a multicultural atmosphere will not hit our buttons correctly.</p>
<p>I, for example, love the way whites play the fiddle in folk music. I also love celtic music. I doubt many Asians or blacks do. There is little probability that either of these music styles will ever gain enough ground in our country to really develop to their full potential.</p>
<p>2. You want us to &#8220;live and let live.&#8221; So, for someone like me, who wants white descendants, how do I make sure my bloodline does not get absorbed into the amerindian and black bloodlines if I do not live in a white country?</p>
<p>Add to this the unfortunate truth that whites are the most desirable of all races.</p>
<p>3. As far as people who want to race mix (a.k.a. blacks who want to have a chance to screw as many white girls as possible), that is fine. I would suggest you have a small multicultural homeland for multicultural people like yourselves who want to race-mix, and let people like me have a homeland. However, there is no more white homeland. </p>
<p>Even better, people could get mail-order spouses/prostitutes. That way, every country could enjoy their unique culture, and the black men who cannot stand living without white p**** can find some way to get a white girl to meet their needs.</p>

I would think in doing so, and instilling your beliefs in your children, you&rsquo;d have a pretty good chance of having many generations of white descendants.</p>

if an Asian marries an African and they have a child, if you presume the dna from the Asian and African mingle to create a child that is averaged between them, and I&rsquo;m not too sure that is how it works. then the child&rsquo;s IQ would be 95. the same average as the two adults. 105 +85 = 190 divided by 2 = 95.<br/>
and there are a lot more Asians then there are African, so the average would be raised over generations. if the next Asian marries a mixed Asian/African you will start with 105 and 95 so the average would be 100 now. than the next full Asian breeds with the 3/4 Asian 1/4 African and you get to 102.5<br/>

let me ask you this. if I have identical twins and I put one in the crib and never have any more then minimal interactions with it than feeding and such. but the other I read to and play with an give it building blocks and talk about shapes and colors and numbers. I send the one to school and the other I make work the fields, say pick cotton. do you think their IQ would test the same at age 6? 12? 20?</p>

you do know there have been studies among Europeans that have seen an increase in IQ in like 20 years. the east germans under communism showed low IQ compared to the west germans. should that &#8216;tribe&rsquo; show the same IQ? then after reunification they leveled out with the west germans.</p>

so does that not extrapolate out to a person you doesn&rsquo;t exercise his brain or little is demanded of his brain, will also have a stunted IQ? early brain development is extremely important. a babies brain is like a sponge, literally. if the baby spend most of the day in a papoose strapped to mom&rsquo;s back while she works the filed. it is reasonable to expect at age 6 the child will have a lower IQ to a child how was read to and played with block and different shapes and colors.<br/>

I couldn&rsquo;t see his head and I thought to my self who is that black kid. my sister lives in a very white neighborhood. so I bent down to see out the sliding glass door at an angle so I could see his face. turned out is was my nephew. so I said to my sister, &#8216;you might want to get alex in out of the sun, I thought he was a black kid. she and my other sister who was sitting next to her started to laugh. and then she told us that he came home crying from school one day because another kid asked him what he &#8216;was&rsquo; and didn&rsquo;t believe him when he said he was white. she said the boy said &#8216;I don&rsquo;t know what you are, but you are no white boy&rsquo;.<br/>
the other funny thing is that my oldest brother is married to a Filipino. and his kids don&rsquo;t stand out in the photos like alex does.<br/>

<p>&#8220;The 2011 census recorded that 2,998,264 people or 36.7% of London&rsquo;s population are foreign-born making London the city with the second largest immigrant population, behind New York City, in terms of absolute numbers. The table to the right shows the most common countries of birth of London residents.

That is exactly what our youth have heen brainwashed with in the schools and pop culture. I disagree with that. The evidence is that race profoundly matters. Compare the civilizations built by the different races. What meaningful advances in medicine and science have been made by the different races? How has civilization been improved for the betterment of all mankind and which races brought those things about? Which forms of government and legal systems do most people on the planet prefer to live under and which race devised such systems?</p>
<p>For you, none of that matters. Congolese Africans could just have easily put a man on the moon as any Europeans. All the great scientists, writers, painters, and composers could have been Chinese or Korean. The marvels of modern medicine and the exploration of space, electricity, and splitting the atom were just around the corner for Guatemalans and Mexicans.</p>

the Indians (sub-continent) also had the firs sewer system. I forget the civilization, began with an H I think. like you say, everyone has their dark ages. and I think the Mughal invasion from the Muslims and then the British empire set them back a bit. but no doubt India is a hellhole.</p>

So if you like burning your women, then I guess you move back to the dark ages when India loves doing that. The Brits stopped that. They also introduced modern medicine and universities to the Indians.<br/>
Looks like your brother has a low race mind. I too have heard that the Mayans came with the concept of 0 and other astrological stuff. Why aren&rsquo;t you married??<br/>

And yes, that place was the most advanced civilization in the world at one time. The Hindus had the most advanced sewage system in the world at that time, the complexity of which would not be matched until ancient Roman times about a thousand years later. They also had the most advanced medicine in the world at that time. As early as the 6th century BCE, they had developed artificial limbs, bone fracture repair, brain surgery, Caesarean section, cataract surgery, ear surgery, plastic surgery, urinary stone removal, and perhaps even smallpox inoculation (see the Sushruta Samhita). In fact, Hindu medicine was so advanced that Hippocrates himself traveled to Indus Valley to learn from Hindu physicians. Yes, Hippocrates was not actually the father of medicine. The number zero and our modern concept of numerals originated in Indus Valley, though English speakers mistakenly call it &#8220;Arabic numerals&#8221; (as it was introduced to the West by the Arabs), technically it should be called &#8220;Hindu numerals&#8221;. The Hindus were also the first to document the theory of gravity, thousands of years before Issac Newton proved it.</p>

and I googled zero. there is not a consensus on it, some claim the Babylonians came up with it first and it migrated down to the hindus. another guy says the Samarians actually had it 4 to 5,000 years ago. but they do say the mayans independently developed it. anyway, what you are saying is that the ancient whites learned from others? next you are going to try to convince me the Chinese invented stuff?</p>

1. does your claim of white identity being &#8216;eliminated&rsquo;, have anything to do with population numbers?<br/>
2. are you claiming white genocide because people aren&rsquo;t &#8216;allowed&rsquo; to identify themselves as whites?<br/>
3. were do you get the idea that whites can&rsquo;t call themselves white?<br/>
4. does the US census form not still have &#8216;white&rsquo; as a choice for racial identification?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-753498" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>1. Yes the percentage of white people is falling in relation to the overall population.<br/>
2. I am claiming white genocide as it is politically incorrect to identify as white and publicly state that you want your racial group to continue (unlike other groups).<br/>
3. I understand that white people can call themselves white but even identifying as white in public is discouraged. This opinion is formed by daily interactions with others.<br/>
4. The US census form does have white as a choice?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you understand my point that there are pressures that are media/policy driven that undermine white identity that do not exist for other groups.</p>

do you want, as ibwhite said, a sizable portion of America carved out for whites only?<br/>

anyway, just trying to ascertain how you mean to preserve the white race. others look to do it through force and coercion. so do you think you are more the rule or the exception in this movement. or do you not even consider yourself in this movement. this guy jarod taylor was mentioned on the wiki page for &#8216;white nationalists&rsquo;.</p>

I don&rsquo;t have these bit of white guilt. I understand times have changed. social norms have changed. the age of conquest is mostly behind us. obviously if you are big enough and strong enough you can still conquer land: see Russia and Crimea: China and Tibet. but if you are small and weak and the strong don&rsquo;t want you to, you can&rsquo;t: Iraq and Kuwait: the Falklands: Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair. By your logic, the non-Whites who have managed to gain a foothold in White countries have every right to remain there as any White person. You guys don&rsquo;t want that, right? Likewise, I believe every race have a right to their native homeland, an area where they have adapted to live in for millenia.</p>

<p>I have friends and family of other races.  We need to start being honest about this with them.  Maybe we need to start with little truths but don&rsquo;t forget to be kind about it because most of them would love to be white like us.  That is the truth.</p>

His secretary responded in his behalf, clearly noting that WFB had read the book with favorable regard and wished to express his appreciation for having been provided the copy.  The book?  AMERICA&rsquo;S BIMODAL CRISIS, written under the assumed name, &#8220;Stanley Burnham&#8221; .  The initial &#8220;edition&#8221; of this book published by an ad hoc entity (&#8220;maybe using a bit of scholarly grant money???&#8221;) was BLACK INTELLIGENCE (i.e. &#8220;IQ&#8221;) IN WHITE SOCIETY.   It was right at the heart of the Great Taboo.   And in the same time frame of the early 90&rsquo;s, there was equal gratitude from NR/ WFB for a copy of John R. Baker&rsquo;s RACE and for a never formally published Xerox copy of &#8220;Letters in Defense of Rushton&#8221; representing written public letters in defense of Prof. J. Philippe Rushton&rsquo;s cutting edge research into evolved racial differences<br/>
(&#8220;maybe using a bit of scholarly grant money???&#8221;).<br/>
Somewhere later, NR seemed to &#8220;get religion&#8221;.  I refer, of course, to the PC gospels.</p>

tolerance in the white world has been hard fought and slow coming. it has been increasing at a rapid pace in since the 70s. but many white countries outlawed homosexuals up until the civil rights movements. you don&rsquo;t see how your freedom is tied to others?<br/>

<p>Really? Perhaps you would like to enlighten everyone with all of the loving and accepting non-White societies that have given homosexuals and other minorities ample room to live and prosper. Please, by all means, start naming the races(and the countries where they have majority control) that are more tolerant to minorities and those with minority views.</p>

<p>Even previously approved comments where a link was already approved get thrown right back into the moderation queue if you edit the comment. I tested it again and, yep, if one word or even one letter gets edited it&rsquo;s back to moderation. The only choice an administrator has is to put any comments with links into the moderation queue or not put them into the queue.</p>
<p>Disqus is a really good system because of its ease of use and implementation across various platforms, but it lacks some basic features that would make it more efficient from a moderation standpoint.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said for years and years that Racialism is NOT a singularity because you vote for the &#8220;right&#8221; vetted <i>raceless</i> political party and align yourself and your support with specific social issues. It&rsquo;s a singularity because  &mdash;  and I mean ONLY because  &mdash;  <i>Race</i> trumps all other issues. Race is Family, and Family is Race. When faced with immediate danger and imminent threat of eradication, Race/Family is the only language that should be spoken. Everything else is just gibberish and nothing but an obstacle that wastes precious time. Unfortunately, Time is not something many seem to comprehend and/or value.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-753288" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The issue grows out of the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s application of anti-trust law to the issue of group relations. One group is designated the monopoly entity and then is subjected to onerous punishment. The ultimate punishment is genocide. The a program of genocide largely does not involve mass murder, starvation, forced migrations, or any other thing that create immediate, palpable pain does not make it not genocide.</p>
<p>Note how Christianity is treated as a monopoly religion. But those branches of Christianity which cooperate in administering the anti-white sanctions, that means Catholicism and mainline Protestantism, get relief from the sanctions in return. Meanwhile other branches of Christianity are subjected to sanctions, such as and for example, that graduates of their secondary schools being deemed not qualified to be admitted to certain universities, even some public institutions.</p>
<p>Speaking of monopoly religion, Christianity is not the only religion in the world, by the extant legal definition, that worldwide is a monopoly religion. But try applying monopoly sanctions to that other monotheistic monopoly religion, the one with more than one billion adherents worldwide. Good luck. Or is a monopoly religion only a monopoly religion when some sufficiently large percentage of it adherents are of white European descent?</p>
<p>Anytime you have a policy which has as its aim the extinction of some collective human entity identifiable culturally, let alone phyletically, you have genocide. Whether it hurts or not, whether it happens immediately or take generations, it remains genocide.</p>
<p>Now, I have an answer though. We tell these rest of the world, &#8220;We will stop pillaging your resources, that&rsquo;s how you think of it anyway. Then we will figure out a way to live with the resources we find on our own lands and provide for those who are different than us whom we have to provide for, in North America that means blacks and Native Americans.&#8221; </p>
<p>A harsh and non-utopian solution. But if other peoples do not want to respect our right to exist and maintain our type, identity and fused contemporary culture, what then is a solution? What is so great about our fat materialism, fixation on the nuclear family and extreme individualism anyway? We have a heritage of religion, thought, literature, music, visual art, invention, culture, artisianship. Maybe it&rsquo;s time for a new look at what we live for. As practical matter, then maybe ordinary people could live their lives staying in one community from birth to death. Be able to take a bus or a streetcar again, instead of having to own one motor vehicle for each member of the family. Be able to go to a live show at night instead of sitting being locked doors in front of a home entertainment center. Maybe people who do have to relocate for their jobs will be able live close to where they work, instead of facing a mind numbing commute just to be able to provide their children with safety and some cultural coherence.</p>

<p>Rural Georgia has Piggly-Wiggly stores, one of which in McRae, GA.  You may have those in Florida, too.  The one in McRae is staffed by all whites, as far as I could tell, but virtually all employees appeared very young, around 25 and younger.  Last July I stopped in and noticed three teenage girls congregating at register 3 with no waiting and no other registers open.  </p>
<p>After about 20 minutes, I was ready to check out, and the same three girls yapping it up at register 3.  I interrupted, asking who is in charge of check out this a.m.  One of the girls proceeded to scan everything with her head turned away, carrying on the conversation.  Then she told me the total, turned her head away again, talking to her two friends while she had her hand outstretched to take my money.  </p>
<p>Then, before leaving, I interrupted their conversation one more time, saying, &#8220;Okay, this is part where you are supposed to say, Thank you for shopping at our Piggly Wiggly, have a nice day, and come back again.  I&rsquo;m not leaving until all three of you girls say that.&#8221;    I wasn&rsquo;t angry, just concerned that these white girls don&rsquo;t know any better about how serious their jobs are.   Then we all had a good laugh over it.</p>

there is only one pig in the area that I ever saw. in Clearwater off east bay and keene. I always thought it strange that there was this one lonely pig. my parents are from Wisconsin and I have many relatives who were butchers for the pig up there.<br/>

but yes, by law you can no longer refuse service to someone based on race. with this I agree. as do the vast majority of americans. I would hope over 90% but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

I&rsquo;ve never seen any black Amish, they seem to have managed to seclude themselves. there are like 10,000 Mennonites in Belize. I don&rsquo;t think they intermarry with the mayans and the blacks. do you speak low land german? I&rsquo;m sure you can learn.</p>

There&rsquo;s an evolutionary reason for this - it increases your chances of passing on more of your genes because of the overlap between the genomes of the parents. </p>
<p>But <em>ultimately</em>, the only real game is to procreate. Period. Animals (and we are, in the end, still animals) will have what is available.</p>
<p>Take the example Mr. Taylor used in the above article: that of the Cuban crocodile. Here, let me quote the SciAm article on the subject:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the world&rsquo;s most endangered crocodilians, the Cuban crocodile, is facing a genomic identity crisis. The island&rsquo;s rare, endemic species has been interbreeding with its more abundant cousin, the American crocodile, creating hybrid offspring and posing a threat to its survival. In each baby, a portion of the Cuban crocodile genome is replaced by American crocodile genes. With each subsequent generation, more and more Cuban genes are lost, and eventually the species could go extinct.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that the Cuban crocodile probably would prefer its own Cuban croc pals to mate with, if absolutely given the choice. Ultimately though, the Cuban just wants to mate&hellip;like all species. And it is being surrounded by another type of croc that outbreeds it. The longer this goes on, the fewer and fewer breeding options the Cuban will have outside of the American crocodile. Interbreeding will continue until the rarer Cuban genome is essentially wiped out. </p>
<p>Crocodiles on the whole will survive&hellip;but without the unique Cuban among them.</p>
<p>Note, there was a point in time when the Cuban crocodile was abundant! And NO ONE would have imagined this happening. NOW it is so far past a tipping point that scientists fear it may be too late to save the crocs.</p>
<p>Whites are very much like the Cuban crocodile. There are currently still enough of us (and we control enough resources!) that most people consider the idea of our disappearance a laughable concept that only &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; are worried about. Yet in almost every country dominated by white people, we have faster-breeding peoples moving in. Whites are being constantly exposed to the other &#8220;breeds&#8221; as mating options. Interracial relationships are slowly climbing, and have been for decades. That will likely hit a point for whites when it increases very suddenly and very fast, because white people will run out of white-exclusive mating options.</p>
<p>Of course, we are not crocodiles. We, unlike the crocs, can consider the consequences of what we do. And IF most white people were racially conscious, we would resist invasion. The problem is, most people are NOT racially conscious&hellip;and all of our media and education right now is focused on keeping it that way.</p>
<p>We too can be genetically swamped&hellip;and most people will not see it coming until we hit the sudden tipping point where our endangerment is very obvious. The same thing that happened to the Cuban croc CAN and WILL happen to us unless we move now to protect our &#8220;habitats&#8221; from invasion.</p>
<p>This is what people mean when they say racial mixing is being forced on us. We don&rsquo;t mean rape. We mean that our societies are being structured in a suicidal way that will result in our racially-asleep people being genetically swamped. </p>
<p>And our objections to this are denounced by critics as &#8220;racist&#8221; to keep us silenced.</p>
<p>Your individualistic way of looking at this (&#8220;have whatever offspring you want&#8221;) is blind to the overall picture.</p>

<p>Instinct or innate behavior is the inherent inclination of a living organism towards a particular complex behavior. The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a fixed action pattern (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a clearly defined stimulus.</p>
<p>Consciousness is the quality or state of awareness, or, of being aware of an external object or something within oneself.[1][2] It has been defined as: sentience, awareness, subjectivity, the ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood, and the executive control system of the mind.[3] Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a student of Locke, you know like Jefferson (who had sex with a black chic. all behaviors are learned: &#8220;Locke&rsquo;s theory of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of identity and the self, figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers such as Hume, Rousseau, and Kant.

<p>Simply put, I am NOT explaining all of this to you AGAIN. My comment which begins, &#8220;MOST people instinctively prefer their own race,&#8221; addresses this. Check your Disqus inbox and read it again if you&rsquo;re confused.</p>

<p>What is the point of this question? Seems like a really Soc 101 idea that you could define culture with &#8220;five things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something for you, name an aspect of culture which you think is not influenced by a people&rsquo;s genetics.</p>

<p>you said &#8220;&#8221;MOST people instinctively prefer their own race,&#8221;&#8221; there is no way of knowing this. this is a false premise. you would need a population of people who were raised without seeing any interaction between spouses or having seen their own reflection to determine this. </p>
<p>I grew up watching my white mother kiss my white father before he went to work every work day as long as I can remember. I look in the mirror and see a white face and a small nose. I don&rsquo;t think of my self as ugly, but attractive. so obviously I&rsquo;ve been taught to be attracted to white women. that is not an instinct, that is a learned behavior. </p>
<p>anyway, AGAIN, if you are right and whites INSTINTIVELY will gravitate to breeding with whites, what is there to worry about? </p>
<p>&#8220;Here&rsquo;s something for you, name an aspect of culture which you think is not influenced by a people&rsquo;s genetics.&#8221; language, dress, diet,  architecture, math, science, government, philosophy&hellip;.pretty much everything.</p>

What logical reason is there for you not to have decided you&rsquo;re repulsive, and so are people who look like you? If you&rsquo;ve been taught we&rsquo;re all equal, shouldn&rsquo;t you find all people equally attractive? </p>
<blockquote><p>anyway, AGAIN</p></blockquote>
<p>AGAIN, go back and reply to my earlier comment if you have some sort of question regarding my explanation.</p>
<blockquote><p>language, dress, diet, architecture, math, science, government, philosophy</p></blockquote>
<p>Several of those things are directly influenced by intelligence, which varies by race.</p>
<p>Diet and dress often have more to do with climate and availability of resources, yet you will still see genetic influence. As an example, a highly collectivist culture is going to have more uniforms. Collectivist behaviour is affected by genes.</p>
<p>Languages reflect all sorts of genetic differences. Less intelligent hunter-gatherer peoples may not have language for any abstract concepts, for instance.</p>
<p>So pretty much nothing.</p>

so you are saying that genetic traits lead to philosophy and mathematics, not cultural advancements. so hunter-gather cultures don&rsquo;t have philosophies, not because they are hunter-gathers, but because they are genetically inferior. so why have the genetically superior races been hunter-gatherers at one time?</p>

That leaves 92% who are not white, or are, at best, mixed parentage.  So why is it amazing that we might want to be considered &#8216;threatened&rsquo;?  Once I began opening my eyes to how heavily Hispanic my home county of Los Angeles is (over 50%, with some communities   &mdash;   such as Commerce   &mdash;    being 98% Hispanic), I became alarmed.  My own community of Whittier is now 65% Hispanic.  People   &mdash;    look around you!!! Check out your community&rsquo;s demographics on Wikipedia to get a ball-park figure!  You&rsquo;ll choke!  So, we have every right to be ALARMED, BUT NOT RACIST!  How dare anyone say we are racist when we are declining worldwide.</p>

As Mr. Taylor alluded to, a very large percentage of White people most certainly think survival of their race/culture is important. There wouldn&rsquo;t be such a thing as White Flight if that weren&rsquo;t the case. But I guess you would have us believe that White people just so happen to almost always find the Whiter areas to live in when they believe it&rsquo;s time to pack up and find greener pastures? All these years and decades of brainwashing people into believing the lies of multiculturalism and unchecked diversity, and the overwhelming majority of White people still just so happen to surround themselves with people that look and even act a lot like them. Coincidence, right?</p>
<p>The only distinction that can be made is that there is still a small number of White people who are vocal, visible and unapologetic when it comes to their preferences vs a larger number of White people who are still trying to hide their preferences behind a facade of color blind universalism.</p>
<p>Why are many of the medium-sized bastions of Liberalism just as segregated and pristine White as the more Conservative ones? I think it&rsquo;s because it is extremely easy to consider yourself a beacon of multiracial utopianism when you just so happen to live around mostly White people, while never much coming into contact with all of the &#8220;diversity&#8221; you claim is so wonderful and is the bedrock of society.</p>
<p>Why  &mdash;  if racism and the people who would support racialist politics are such a tiny and shrinking minority  &mdash;  has there been an explosion of Nationalist and &#8220;far-right&#8221; people and groups across the planet who aren&rsquo;t hiding their views or identities?</p>

However I agree with annoymous&rsquo;s comment that fruit farmers do not really care about the end result of having non whites pick their produce for cheap labor. They worry about the money they can make to ensure that their kids have a good life in a majority white community, but couldn&rsquo;t care less about other whites suffering because of these third worlders.</p>

You mean to tell me that they are smart enough to intentionally avoid the black areas because they know those areas are always going to be more dangerous than the Whiter areas, but so stupid that they can&rsquo;t comprehend through simple deduction that less White people around means less safety for their family? Either they don&rsquo;t care about their survival or they do care, which is it?</p>
<p>I surmised and you took that and condensed it  &mdash;  a small minority are vocal and upfront, while a larger majority still hide their preferences while giving lip service to the positive benefits of diversity and multiculturalism. But both end up trying like crazy to insulate themselves from black people. I can prove that White people find White areas to move to when they have the choice. Now I want you to prove that White people aren&rsquo;t using &#8220;crime rates&#8221; as a convenient(albeit fairly accurate) way of segregating themselves.</p>

In a few short generations Sweden will no longer be a white majority country and their white children will eventually be bowing submissively to Mecca every day. It is astonishing what is happening to western countries and whites and I for one want to know who is behind it.</p>

In 1917 the Marxist Bolsheviks took over Russia, fought a brutal civil war the next half decade.  Russia became the Soviet Union, harbinger of a brave new Marxist determinist world.  Eventually, guided by the mass murdering hand of Joseph Stalin, the specific synthesis of Marxism and Russian culture was called &#8220;Marxism-Leninism&#8221;, the official ideology (atheist religion) of the former Soviet union.  Carlos the Jackal was a devoted Marxist-Leninist, for example, and there&rsquo;s an excellent Netflix piece on him, by the way.<br/>
Boiled down, whatever specific form it takes, Marxism boils down to this.<br/>
1.  No God, everything is materialist and materialistically determined.  There is, however a mystical formula that explains everything.  All people are quantifiable products of their environments and differentiated only by economic &#8220;class&#8221;.<br/>
2  Life is naturally good and suffering is unnatural.  When suffering occurs, it is caused by evil and/or incompetent persons or preferably &#8220;classes&#8221;.  Rich people are rich because they are evil and exploit poor people, who are good and nothing more than the result of the godlike machinations of evil rich people.  The middle class, as always, is inherently screwed.<br/>
In 1963 Prezzy Kennedy - perhaps the last non-crypto-Marxist democratic president, got his head almost blown off and soon after the substantial sums of targeted KGB funds began to become evident in our educational, political, and public sectors.  I date the beginning of the American stealth Marxist revolution as about 1963, its end around the Nixon resignation and the Manson trials.<br/>
The ideology of American style Marxism, once disguised as or underneath the umbrella of &#8220;Liberalism&#8221;, eventually found its own name - PROGRESIVISM.  Sure, another hijacked term in the American context, but also a constantly reappearing meme in Marxist thought and ideology.<br/>
IE:  Marxism-Leninism is related to the Soviet Union in regard to Marxism as Progressivism is related to the United States in regard to Marxism.<br/>
And &#8220;feminism&#8221; as defined by Progressives therefore falls under the umbrella of Marxism.  &#8220;Feminism&#8221; is largely defined by Progressives, therefore &#8220;Feminism&#8221; is a form of Marxism.<br/>
Not that there are not a few Hawksian feminists out there who get this, who are not actually Marxists.  Few and far between though.  Most women just want to be left alone and pursue happiness, not unlike men.</p>

It seems that a lot of women want to be oppressed, although they would never admit it. As for White men being perceived as misogynist, compared to who? What group of men treat their women more like equals than White men do? If non-Whites take over our countries I can guarantee that feminism will be a thing of the past. The vast majority of White men want to treat our women with fairness, but equality is up for debate for a reason. Things haven&rsquo;t exactly gone so well for our race since we instituted universal suffrage. </p>
<p>Feminism is definitely high on the list when it comes to causes for low birth rates. It is a problem when women think that they can delay child birth until their thirties or even later. I&rsquo;m not just blaming the women, because the men are just as bad. However, it is a biological reality that women leave their prime reproductive years earlier than men.</p>

We should work together to gain power and influence and use it to protect ourselves and to promote the great ideals of fair play, hard work and free thinking that we have brought to the world.  We will slowly gain respect and admiration from other communities if we remain loyal to one and other and act as a force for good in the world.

If a comment proposes the superiority of Whites and Western civilization, it tends to get upvotes like there is no tomorrow, whether its true or not. But when proven to be false, the comment that did the debunking tends to get very little, if any, upvotes. Take for instance the two comments I have listed below. As of the writing of this comment, the first comment I have listed has received three upvotes, while the second comment has only received one upvote, and that one&rsquo;s from me.</p>
<p>I understand that everyone&rsquo;s biased to some extent, but at least I try to be balanced and fair. I upvote any comment which I think reflects the truth, whether I like the comment or not. I have upvoted many comments which say bad things about my race and culture if the comment appear to be true; and I have refrained from upvoting many comments which praise my race and culture if the comment appear to be false. Have any commentator here done the same? I guess very few.</p>

<p>&#8220;tolerance in the white world has been hard fought and slow coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really? Perhaps you would like to enlighten everyone with all of the loving and accepting non-White societies that have given homosexuals and other minorities ample room to live and prosper. Please, by all means, start naming the races(and the countries where they have majority control) that are more tolerant to minorities and those with minority views.</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>well we can start with what he said as far as gays are concerned, japan. Thailand is known for it&rsquo;s tolerance of homosexuals and transsexuals.</p>
<p>en[dot]wikipedia[dot]org/wiki/Recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_South_America</p>
<p>south Africa, after eliminating white rule but in protections for non-heterosexuals. </p>
<p>India just passed a law last year extending protections against discrimination of transgendered people. something some America states are yet to do.</p>

Hmmmm&hellip;.. isn&rsquo;t this also the place that gave a platform to an open homosexual? Funny, <i>non</i>?</p>
<p>Actually, the West has been at least as tolerant as most of the rest of the world in its attitudes and freedoms given to those with dissenting views. <i>The West</i> isn&rsquo;t a monolithic entity, even though you are trying to pretend that it is. France has a pretty good track record of more liberal attitudes toward sex(including homosexuals). Isn&rsquo;t France part of the West? I can never remember.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what jacked up version of history and pro-White attitudes you&rsquo;ve been reading up on, but a good majority of those that I&rsquo;ve seen cite reasons for the downfall of Greece and Rome list the primary reasons as a general loss of identity/culture, inability of city-states to fully unite, and, finally, the introduction of Christianity. I&rsquo;m sure you can find plenty who will specifically blame &#8220;queers&#8221; as being the reason. But that has very little to do with the West and its attitudes toward homosexuals as it compares to the rest of the world.</p>

Has AmRen ever taken an official position on homosexuality? If you think it has, then how many degrees away is it from the official positions of other pro-White or White Nationalist websites?</p>
<p>I assure you I didn&rsquo;t miss your point. You are saying that, more or less, we tend to be opportunistic and only pretend to hold certain views if we believe it will benefit our arguments. I just don&rsquo;t see that as being true. Those that have more anti-homosexual attitudes continue to be that way, and they make it perfectly clear. Those that are indifferent or don&rsquo;t have anti-homosexual views continue to be that way, and they will usually let you know that, too. There&rsquo;s no waffling going on. If you can show where someone specific espoused anti-homosexual attitudes and then turned right around and pretended to not be that way, then I&rsquo;ll concede my position. Well, I will at least concede that said person is being manipulative and deceitful. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll have to leave you with a little play on a quote:</p>
<p><i>Do we contradict ourselves?<br/>
Very well, then, we contradict ourselves.<br/>
We are large, we contain multitudes.</i></p>

<p>You are visiting and commenting on a little island oasis that is surrounded by nothing but predators. Many of the people who inhabit this island don&rsquo;t have many options. They have been the victims of a vicious anti-White pogrom that lies, manipulates, deceives, ridicules, slanders, libels, attacks and tries to stamp out their existence simply because they just so happen to have not swallowed the poison of multiculturalism that was being force fed to them. Many here can attest to the fact that the very second you let down your guard and try to become a paragon of truth and &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; attitudes toward those that wish you nothing but death, it will be used against you. Practically every White country is being swamped with non-Whites because they were unbiased, tolerant and tried to be &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; when they really shouldn&rsquo;t have been.</p>
<p> &hellip;&hellip;..and yet you are surprised that many people here are biased toward their own kind? <i>Hello! I&rsquo;m reality. Nice to meet you.</i></p>

Unlike some people, who only bothered to read up on the achievements of their own culture and then simply assume that others have done nothing, I am aware of the greatness of ancient Egypt, ancient Europe, and the Indus Valley Civilization. I was just trying to give everyone a fair representation.</p>
<p>As a wise AmRenner said, if Whites try to claim that their race invented the majority of everything, if not everything, then they become no better than the Blacks who try to claim ancient Egypt, and the Arabs who try to claim Byzantium. This &#8220;our race are responsible for almost every worthy accomplishment in history&#8221; attitude is clearly being display here.</p>
<p>To be fair, I understand that Western accomplishments are being downplayed or outright stolen from you guys (see Black Invention Myths). I&rsquo;m not trying to say that Whites are the most stupid people in the world, as many like to claim nowadays; I&rsquo;ll be happy to point out to those who don&rsquo;t know that Whites have been responsible for many magnificent achievements (the Antikythera mechanism, concrete, the earliest accurate calculation of the circumference of the Earth, the modern classification of animals and plants, and so on). It&rsquo;s just that I am trying to give everyone, regardless of their race, a fair representation here, and to give them credit where credit is due.</p>

As for the Chinese, there are things admirable about the Chinese, such as the discipline to build the Great Wall of China, the colorful festivals, the invention of gun powder;  those things are unique to them that they can call their own.  </p>
<p>Democracy, republicanism, human rights, technological and medical advancement are chiefly advances of European/white thought and culture, though not without its drawbacks.  I think the drawback is not those ideas, but the mistaken assumption that those ideas are universally compatible in other cultures with no traditions of western ideals.  So, with multiculturalsm, we accept non-westernized immigrants who bring their third-world ways with them and don&rsquo;t assimilate to western ideals.  </p>
<p>Mexico is another example.  I like some things about Mexico despite being very critical of Mexican people.  I like the history of the Mayas, the piramids the incorporation of zero in mathematics, the Spanish architecture of the buildings all over Mexico;  however, the Mexican people seemingly are very apathetic to animal cruelty, evdienced by bullfighting and cockfighting.   And there is seemingly no urgency to solve the thousands of murders that have taken place by the narcos since 2000.  And with open borders, the violence we see in Mexico is now taking root in this country.</p>

Owing to how well entrenched philosophical orthodoxy has become, and the decline in critical thinking, any open discussion of race will send most of the public into apoplectic shock. So, in order to achieve your policy ends, you should focus on questions of culture &amp; economics. If you tell a Dutchman &#8220;don&rsquo;t let Mohammad in because he is not white,&#8221; you will receive a negative response, because they almost certainly known a good, reasonably secular, well-integrated Muslims. But, if you tell him &#8220;Islamic culture is not compatible with a free and modern society, that grants rights to women and gays&hellip;hence we have to carefully screen all potential immigrants&hellip;&#8221; a reasonable Dutchman will seriously consider policies that would have the end result of reducing Muslim Immigration. The same goes with economics, if you emphasize that high level immigration of uneducated families exacerbates economic inequality, strains the safety net and even has a negative effect on the environment, you may be able to even reach some liberals. This would fall short of your goal, but will help push the public towards a reasonable reduction of immigration, and a focus on individuals who hold the greatest potential to economically, socially and culturally integrate into the west.</p>

There has been a great deal of diversity (anti-white)  brainwashing over the past few decades and often whites are raised to feel self-loathing simply because they are white.

<p>In order to &#8220;reach&#8221; many of these people (and I was one of them!!) it is important to speak their language and bring them around slowly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting to say this, maybe for a decade or longer, and surely this is not the right time, after such a nice article that stands on it&rsquo;s own. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the right time to say this, and for just the right time or comment, but that time just never came up. It&rsquo;s likely not the right time is now. Survival, yes, every creature wants to do that more than anything, so we are told. Unless you really like White girls, what exact aesthetic (outside of preserving oneself) is so important? But I can&rsquo;t help recall the late Leonard Nimoy, with his daughter appearing with him on a few TV commercials a generation ago or so. If you might remember, she looked so much like her father. She&rsquo;s very attractive in her own way but she resembles her father so much; sure, they may have been made up to look more alike but the resemblance truly is uncanny. Just seeing them together, and maybe thinking about it, is more than anything I could ever write in favor of preserving Whites or assuring some Whites survive.</p>

This leads me to believe it is a big deal to you, at least when native american&rsquo;s were displaced. And in something close to your words, all of them were killed. </p>
<p>I agree with you. Race and culture are completely separate things. What is the point of saying &#8216;race creates culture (likely absurd or at least easy to poke fun at)&rsquo;? There&rsquo;s no purely White culture left to take credit for. At least I want no credit for modern day America. Being proud of a culture engaged in &#8216;White genocide&rsquo; makes no sense at all. They&rsquo;re under some delusion they&rsquo;re ruling, I guess, when they can only post on some site like AmRen.  And also, for good or for bad, Whites have already been contaminated and their cultures are no longer &#8216;pure&rsquo;. </p>
<p>I would say, up to now, this has even been been a positive thing. Feminist want to blame the past &#8216;success&rsquo; of White cultures on feminist change. White racists want to blame it on their White genes, apparently. Why not blame it on multiculturalism itself? A critical mass of White supremacist feelings, or delusions, all engendered by being exposed to &#8216;poor people of color&rsquo;, somewhere know to them, propaganda, (only poor &#8216;blacks&rsquo;, &#8216;gays&rsquo;, &#8216;jews&rsquo; suffer in this world - so shut up, sit down, and get back to work - you luck guy) why not blame this, or &#8216;racism&rsquo; itself for the &#8216;ascension&rsquo; of the West?</p>
<p>With populations so mixed up at this point there is no proof of the idea &#8216;race equals culture&rsquo;. To prove that, the races would need to be further separated, something which might lead to another competition all it&rsquo;s own. </p>
<p>I would separate culture from economics.  I&rsquo;m not a Marxist. I can do that - I&rsquo;m the last one alive!</p>
<p>What is your view?</p>

yes, race and culture are separate things. economics is an important part of culture. that is going to be the demise of America, the pushing left of our capitalistic economic system.<br/>

I don&rsquo;t often, but I gather in Nazi Germany there laws that only effected one group. In Nazi Germany it was official &#8216;education&rsquo; policy that Jews were responsible for all evil in the past, all evil in the world in their present day, and would presumably be responsible for all evil and all that was wrong going on into the future. That&rsquo;s pretty much each piece of the puzzle here in the US. Individually, it&rsquo;s just a &#8216;history lesson&rsquo;. Taken together the message is that White men are guilt of all things in the past and all people on this Earth suffer because of them. Even the tiniest creatures on the Earth suffer because of White men or White conservative men and their great. Even the rocks and trees suffer because of our greed. Maybe that wasn&rsquo;t official education policy in Nazi Germany, I don&rsquo;t know, but that may as well be official policy here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty rare I make this comparison but I have a time or two before. Heck, in today&rsquo;s world, even Whites saying they are victims of racism is considered to be White racism.</p>

<p>Of course it does. It proves liberalism is not inherent to homosexuality. (Not that it wouldn&rsquo;t be ridiculous to think anything else.)</p>
<p>Homosexuals are overwhelming liberal because liberals promise gays a future largely free from violence and persecution and conservatives do not. <em>That&rsquo;s the only reason.</em> Full stop. The liberal platform that equates all minorities, and leads GLBT folk to believe they maybe have some sort of spiritual solidarity with other oppressed people is an ideological soft-shoe to expand the liberal base, and can change amongst all but the true believers.</p>
<p>There was an article here not too long ago about homosexuals joining France&rsquo;s nationalist Front National - the party now has support from a greater percentage of queers than it does heterosexuals. Why? Because homosexuals realize that Muslim immigration into France is putting them in danger, and liberals are doing nothing to stop it.</p>
<p>When a similar realization hits homosexuals in America, trust, gays will abandon liberalism in droves. </p>
<p>Outreach on the part of nationalists would speed that process up; but I&rsquo;m not holding my breath for most nationalists movements to be as wise to that as France.</p>
<blockquote><p>By the way, this assumes that people value the &#8220;whiteness&#8221; of an individual, over everything else. I for one do not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Outside of rejecting criminality, why not? Ideological purity on unrelated issues like homosexuality and religion will kill us. Mr. Taylor is completely correct to try to draw people together despite differing opinions.</p>

<p>But I would point out that liberals actually lament a lot of &#8220;racism&#8221; in the gay community. Quite a few white homosexuals actually <em>don&rsquo;t</em> date interracially, or exclude particular races (blacks especially). Check Huffpo&rsquo;s Gay Voices for posts on &#8220;racism&#8221; - they are mostly about gay men&rsquo;s refusal to date interracially, and/or disapproval of interracial relationships among homosexuals.</p>

<p>Ironically, revoltingly,  non-whites <i>as well</i> feel as you do, i. e., they prefer to be around whites, but with a twist:  they want to ensconce themselves in the midst of white nations, in the midst of their civilizations, their cultures, what they have created and provided - to <i>profit</i> from them, to parasitize them, to seize them, all the while shutting themselves up to their own race socially and demanding their own cultural enclaves.

The story-teller said as kids they would &#8220;play&#8221; with the device,  repeatedly X-raying themselves as it was a compelling novelty.  You may easily guess the &#8220;rest of the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cancer analogies are often cogent means to drive-home a point.  A <i>healthy</i> individual is subject to a <i>contingent</i> cause of death.  If he is completely unaware of the cause he dies in what should have been full vigor-of-life.  He dies never knowing that there was a completely <i>avoidable</i> cause.  This is a stunningly fitting analogy for America.  There is more than one cause for America&rsquo;s terminal cancer but one or two are puissant enough to serve for an &#8220;explanation.&#8221;  That America has, over the last 100 years and coming into completeness over the past 50, been re-made into a Jewish creation, may serve as that explanation.  The once-healthy America (viewing the same as a <i>single</i> individual) is that one who is terminal with that X-ray exposure but is insensible of its being the cause.  Not one out of a hundred Americans fundamentally understand <i>why</i> their &#8220;country&#8221; increasingly resembles a tumble-down pigsty.  And it is certain not one-in-a-thousand have even heard of &#8220;critical theory.&#8221;  Jared Taylor may eschew what I&rsquo;ve just said.  This is inexcusable for someone of his seasoning, intelligence and cosmopolitanism.  But not only am I compelled by personal experience and the  <i>vast</i> evidence for the above charge, but countless Jewish leaders themselves have admitted, even boasted of their fundamental alteration of America.  At least in this&hellip;they are believeable.</p>

<p>Yowgolly did the fit hit the shan. </p>
<p>The other housemates (except one) unanimously voted me out. Fortunately, my racial realist best friend/&#8221;little brother&#8221; and I were the legal leaseholders, and he got so teed off about the whole thing that he ran around roaring until everybody else moved out and it was just the two of us again.  😀</p>
<p>The moral of this story is, BE CAREFUL WHO YOU SPEAK TO. Even people who have seemed sympatico can turn on a dime if you utter an opinion which is Politically Incorrect. They&rsquo;re not bad people, they&rsquo;re just brainwashed.</p>

<p>After Mitt Romney lost the 2012 election, the Republican party was doing all sorts of hand wringing over how they should reach out to minorities (at the direction of their media masters)  I perceived this to be a mistake.  The Republican party should be reaching out to whites, overtly and explicitly.  Forget the media (and those who tend to control it).</p>

Jared Taylor offers whites some practical long term strategies to survive and thrive the looming demographic tsunami in which we will become minorities in our own Western nations.<br/>

Time for some sober introspection for me and thoughts of how to do my part to reverse this in a positive manner. The thought that comes to mind is we must make an environment where whites choose to be unashamedly proud of our heritage and desire to keep and expand it. I do not believe fear and violence will produce the desired result although I am well enough prepared to protect my family and/or make a hell of go at it.</p>

<p>Had you told me, &#8220;white people should survive because white people are naturally dominant!&#8221; I would have skittered away in horror and run back to the arms of liberals.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this argument works on the unconverted, and I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s at all necessary to say to converts, either. There&rsquo;s no shortage of ego about supposed white superiority in nationalism.</p>
