<h1 class="title">Should We Still Fight for Immigration Control?</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Hubert Collins, American Renaissance, April 1, 2015</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
Yes.</div> 
</div> 



<p>It has become steadily more popular for white dissidents to claim that immigration is no longer an issue-or at least not worth much of our effort. Richard Spencer, <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2012/11/the-bright-side-of-illegal-immigration/">Jack Donovan</a>, and <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2011/04/debate-on-the-northwest-imperative/">Harold Covington</a> take this view, and many others agree. With due respect, I think they are wrong.</p>
<p>But first, let us consider their positions. This is from Richard Spencer&rsquo;s <a href="../../../archives/eleventh-american-renaissance-conference-2013.html">address</a> at the 2013 <em>American Renaissance</em> conference:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the summer 2011, the Census Bureau reported that the majority of children born in the United States are non-white. Thus, from our perspective, any future immigration-restriction efforts are meaningless. Even if all immigration, legal and illegal, were miraculously halted tomorrow morning, our country&rsquo;s demographic destiny would merely be delayed by a decade or two. Put another way, we could win the immigration battle and nevertheless lose the country, and lose it completely.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Donovan is of a similar, but more cynical, mindset. He sees the chaos being brought on by swarms of illegal immigrants as a good thing because it will hasten the collapse of our current, undesirable regime-which will make it easier to create a nation more to our liking. A few years ago he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Illegal immigration is killing my grandfather&rsquo;s America, but that America is never coming back. The bright side I see is that this is all part of the process of creating a failed state-a state where no one believes in the system, where the government is just another shakedown gang, where no one confuses the law with justice. . . . In a failed state, we go back to Wild West rules, and America becomes a place for men again-a land full of promise and possibility that rewards daring and ingenuity, a place where men can restart the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Covington largely agrees. He calls for whites to abandon formal politics completely, and begin <a href="http://northwestfront.org/">migrating to the Pacific Northwest</a> so that they can secede when the federal government becomes weaker.</p>
<p>The conclusion that these men and others have drawn from current demographic <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-population-white-million-019/">projections</a> (which are <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2011/12/20-census-demographics#3">all too plausible</a>), is that since a non-white America is inevitable, white advocates should drop immigration and focus on the creation of a white ethnostate. While I support this goal, it doesn&rsquo;t make immigration irrelevant. Think of it this way: In the year 2100, would a racial secession movement be more likely to succeed if the rebellious whites who made up the movement were 10 percent of the population, or 20 percent? Numbers are always an essential part of political action.</p>
<p>In the history of secession movements, there are not many happy endings: from the Basques in Iberia, to the Kurds in the Middle East, to the Confederacy in 19th century America, fighting for separation is not easy. Aside from the very unusual circumstances of the breakup of the Soviet Union, it is rare for a government to let a group of people establish their own country. Usually, the result is war, and as Napoleon said, &ldquo;God is on the side of the big battalions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Numbers still matter, even in an America where whites were no longer the majority. I would love to live in an American with a white super-majority, and I realize that is impossible now. But a high number is always better than a low number. An America that is 30 percent white is better than one that is 20 percent, 20 percent is better than 10 percent.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;immigration no longer matters&rdquo; argument is almost an endorsement of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/digitalrules/2008/12/26/the-worse-the-better/">Lenin&rsquo;s dictum</a>: &ldquo;the worse, the better.&rdquo; Lenin meant that every misery suffered by the Russian people under the czars was good for the revolution, since poverty, civil unrest, and violence would make more Russians favor a Bolshevik coup. Things in Russia did get bad, and Lenin carried the day in 1917, and the horrible state of Russia in the 1910s helped the Communist cause. Ever since, many revolutionaries have adopted the &ldquo;worse is better&rdquo; mentality.</p>
<p>And indeed, even some revolutions from the Right have benefited from intolerable living conditions. Franco&rsquo;s rise to power in 1930s is an example, as is Pinochet&rsquo;s 1973 coup in Chile. All this suggests that if things get worse in America, a successful white identity movement could arise, but it&rsquo;s not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Sometimes when things get worse, they ignite rebellion, but rebellion fails. Germany after World War One was a terrible place, but the <a href="http://weimarandnazigermany.co.uk/1919-spartacist-uprising/#.VPifiK1dVbs">Spartacist uprising</a> didn&rsquo;t last two weeks. Hungary was miserable under the yoke of Soviet tyranny, but <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/4/newsid_2739000/2739039.stm">its bid for freedom was crushed</a>.</p>
<p>And sometimes, of course, when things get worse, they just get worse. In the 1930s, Joseph Stalin began deliberately starving the people of Ukraine in what is called the &ldquo;Holodomor.&rdquo; Millions of people died in just a few years, but no revolution came of it. In the last few decades, Argentina has suffered <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/30/us-argentina-debt-chronology-idUSKBN0FZ23N20140730">economic crash after economic crash</a>, and no lasting &ldquo;savior government&rdquo; has leaped from the ashes of this perpetual chaos. The Finns were <a href="http://motherearthtravel.com/history/finland/history-3.htm">occupied by the Swedish Empire</a> for <em>over six centuries</em>, but they never had a large-scale revolt until over a century after the Swedes had ceded their Finnish territory to the Russian Empire in the early 19th century.</p>

<p>In the United States, mass immigration <a href="http://www.thesocialcontract.com/booklets/victims-illegal-immigration/victims-of-illegal-immigration.html">literally kills</a> white Americans, raises the crime rate, wrecks <a href="../../../features/2012/04/white-teacher-in-an-la-school.html">schools</a> and <a href="../../../features/2014/01/what-dispossession-looks-like.html">communities</a>, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/05/the-fiscal-cost-of-unlawful-immigrants-and-amnesty-to-the-us-taxpayer">burdens taxpayers</a>, <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/html/eon2007-06-25jl.html">erodes social trust</a>, and on and on. We must limit immigration as much as we can now, both for the benefit of whites today, and for those who may-or may not-take action tomorrow.</p>
<p>How much worse do things have to get before they get better? Things seem bad enough now to justify revolution: The black-on-white rape rate is horrifying, journalists and pundits are regularly <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/books/the-great-purge-the-deformation-of-the-conservative-movement">purged</a> for saying anything &#8220;impolite&#8221; about race, the federal government <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-dept-to-probe-ferguson-police-force/2014/09/03/737dd928-33bc-11e4-a723-fa3895a25d02_story.html">punishes cities for putting down race riots</a>, and the President <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/the-vox-interview-in-which-barack-obama-agrees-with-the-late-sam-francis-on-the-effects-of-mass-immigration">cheers the Balkanization of the country</a>. As the remnant of whites with racial consciousness, it is our duty to protect whites however we can, and cutting immigration is a good place to start.</p>
<p>The mix of immigrants makes a difference, too. Compared to the problem of Muslim immigration into Europe, the Hispanic burden is relatively light. There are already <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/27/u-s-must-save-syria-s-refugees.html">calls</a> for a mass influx of refugees from ISIS, Syria, etc., <a href="../../../features/2014/10/muslim-immigration-and-the-west.html">and stopping that would save lives</a>. Turning the country into Somalia is worse than turning it into Mexico, so rulings against <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/federal-court-cases-against-sheriff-joe-arpaio-seek-to-break-patriotic-immigration-reform-m">Sheriff Joe Arpaio</a> are a setback, but <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-great-somali-welfare-hunt/">Somali immigration</a> is worse.</p>
<p>Not all of those who say immigration is a distraction take a pure, &ldquo;worse is better&rdquo; position. Mr. Spencer, for example, would agree that it would be better if immigration were stopped, but thinks that for white activists to work in that area is a mistake because of the opportunity cost. It may be that continued demographic turmoil is necessary for whites to rediscover their identities, but for now, working towards an ethnostate is the best way for us to spend our meager resources.</p>
<p>I disagree on this count as well. Efforts can be split among worthy causes. You can vote for restrictionist candidates and donate money to a White Student Union. Anyone who supports the <a href="http://cis.org/">Center for Immigration Studies</a> can also give a copy of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s book <a href="../../../store_subdomain/product/books/white-identity.html"><em>White Identity</em></a> to his neighbor for Christmas. All these things help whites, and we all set our own priorities. Nor is activist energy strictly limited like money or time. You may well feel you have done all you can this week for one cause but still be inspired to work hard for a different cause.</p>
<p>As Bismarck <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/424187-politics-is-the-art-of-the-possible-the-attainable">said</a>, &ldquo;Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable-the art of the next best.&rdquo; For the time being, immigration restrictionism is within the realm of possibility in a way that an ethnostate is not. What is possible and good for whites is worth our attention. Historically, immigration has united racial activists. Consider how <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/madison-grant-preserving-buffaloes-redwoods-and-founding-stock-americans">Madison Grant</a> and <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/wahhabism-china-mass-immigration-lothrop-stoddard-rediscovered">Lothrop Stoddard</a> both worked hard to develop a sense of race solidarity among Americans in the 1920s, and how that influenced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924">immigration laws of that decade</a>. In Europe, the <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2013/12/generation-identity-introduces-itself/">Identitarians</a>, so-called &ldquo;far right&rdquo; groups, and the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/frances-far-right-party-seizes-the-moment-and-the-youth#.rrG8qo98v">National Front</a> have had remarkable success in getting whites to think seriously about the future of the continent. They have done so by emphasizing the terrible effects of immigration.</p>
<p>Fighting immigration through the <a href="https://www.numbersusa.com/content/my/tools/grades">electoral process</a> and <a href="http://www.occidentaldissent.com/events/">grassroots activism</a> may not be as glamorous as writing a call to arms for the formation of an ethnostate or <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/three-questions-for-separatists">considering what one would look like</a>, but it is just as important.</p>
<p>Immigration is so damaging to whites that we cannot stop fighting it. Nor can we be completely confident white consciousness will rise like a phoenix after this fire runs its course. Immigration matters, and will always matter. Now is the time to think big, and I support all attempts to <a href="../../../archives/back-issues/november-2004.html#cover">build white communities</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/WaAJYm1S1fI">white societies</a>, but immigration will be a terrible obstacle to achieving those goals.</p>

The ghost of Nazism still haunts the West and prevents whites from organizing to foster racial pride, consolidation and growth (never mind ethnic survival). And without the ability to discuss and be discussed in the mainstream culture, white nationalism remains &#8220;extremist&#8221;, and loses out on masses of ordinary white folk who cannot make that extra step.</p>
<p>I may have a lot in common with the NVA but the Stormfront culture it comes out of is still plagued by vapid white supremacists when what we need is white defenders. I know they sound the same but they are not. For example, I have affinity, friendship and respect with/for some Asian people and/or culture, which makes me automatically persona non grata with Stormfronter types, which is retarded, because I am an avid promoter of white pride and white resistance. </p>
<p>Stormfront is ultimately retarded because of how many good white people it alienates with retarded Nazi ideals. It&rsquo;s like talking about Jews having hooked noses. It&rsquo;s retarded. In fact Stormfront may be the single biggest thing preventing white nationalism today&hellip;but I wonder if you&rsquo;ll think about what I&rsquo;m saying for even a second.</p>

<p>Lastly: yes, Nazi ideals in 2015 is retarded.<br/>
They had many righteous ideals and I&rsquo;m always a strong supporter of Germany and share many of their ideals about securing the future of the white race. But in 2015, the placing of other races besides blacks as subhuman is unacceptable to me-especially for Slavs. Slavs are part of the white master race and Nazi disagreement with that is no longer valid and in fact&hellip;wait for it&hellip;retarded.<br/>

<p>But how about this: there are ethnic peoples of northern Finland and extreme northwest Russia that are neither caucasian (neither Finn nor Slav) or asian (they are not Lapps)-they are a mixture, an very old Eurasian ethny.

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re so confused that people who want a white ethnostate are looking at you oddly for wanting to include asians just because you seem to have a thing for them. The whole point of a white ethnostate is that it exclude non-whites. That include asians.</p>
<p>I disdain &#8216;thuggery&rsquo; as well, but I also understand that every revolution has its foot soldiers, and plenty are not going to be nice people just like forming a new framework for a new white society isn&rsquo;t going to be a &#8216;nice&rsquo; endeavor. White traitors and non-whites in America will always oppose us regardless of how you dress it up. Oh, and I&rsquo;ve been to Stormfront as well. What you&rsquo;re saying about some of them not liking you for respecting asians is true. It&rsquo;s also stupid, because plenty of people on Stormfront respect them as well.

<p>The immigration fight is <i>our</i> fight. Whether we&rsquo;re winning or losing it, it&rsquo;s still the best issue in mainstream politics for us to get our message out there and win over fellow whites. We will probably lose the fight over immigration in the short term, but it&rsquo;s still possible to win many whites over despite the loss. And what&rsquo;s the alternative - to not even try and hope that an equal number of whites trip over one of our websites?</p>

<p>I think that statement expresses a wish more than an objective assessment. </p>
<p>I certainly hope it doesn&rsquo;t come to armed insurrection - as absurdly unlikely as that seems today, who knows what tomorrow holds? - but if it were to the spectre of &#8216;massacre&rsquo; would not deter insurrectionists. They would be people so embittered by the injustice of the political fate foisted on them (by people like you, I might add) and so bereft of hope for a decent existence that the prospect of dying for their cause becomes more likely to inspire them to action than to frighten them into submission. They would not be isolated individuals like the Sikh-temple-shooter, rather their grievances would galvanize them into a coordinated political unit. From their perspective it will never be &#8216;over&rsquo; until it really is over - and the possible course of events may mean that that is a very long time in coming. </p>

The more one wants a strong nationalist culture and the nationalist policies to support it, the more, in my experience, one is inclined towards narrow definitions of white.<br/>
People who aren&rsquo;t particularly interested in a strong nationalist culture - who incline more towards liberty, say - and just want racial demographics that &#8216;work&rsquo; - that avoid the problems of mass multiracialism - are more inclined towards an expansive definition of &#8216;white,&rsquo; happily willing to include types that the above-defined nationalists wouldn&rsquo;t even consider.<br/>
Even though this division means that the question of &#8216;who is white&rsquo; will never be settled, one of the easiest steps is to eliminate obvious non-contenders that some people (obstructionists, probably) have an irrepressible urge to nominate. Sometimes these are people that the &#8216;libertarian-racialists&rsquo; above are willing to include - and that is their prerogative - but they should not dishonestly present such candidates as &#8216;white.&rsquo;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-753010" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Okay, a bit of update. I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like a liberal, but the belief that ancient Egyptians were White largely stemmed from 18th and 19th century Eurocentric scholars who were amazed by the advanced technology of the ancient Egyptians, and who came to the biased conclusion that the ancient Egyptians must be White because only White people could have build an advanced civilization. However, the actual race of the ancient Egyptians have yet to be confirmed. Based on available evidence, it does not appear that they were White, though research is still ongoing.</p>
<p>The DNA results of the mummies have not been confirmed, as it is nearly impossible for accurate results to be obtained from the mummies due to millennia of contamination from bacteria and archaeologists who have handled the mummies. Second, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, the ancient Egyptians were described by the ancient Greeks as &#8220;curly-haired, dark skinned people&#8221;, characteristics not exactly closely associated with Whites. Please note that the aforementioned description came from the ancient Greeks, not exactly a source you would describe as &#8220;liberal&#8221;. Finally, (and on this one point I&rsquo;m just guessing) considering the climate of the Middle East, lack of pigmentation isn&rsquo;t really a useful trait, right? A pale-skinned population living there would easily get skin cancer.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-746965" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Underlying the position that opposing non-White immigration is now futile are three questionable assumptions:</p>
<p>(1) that the Republicans cannot get more of the White vote than they are already getting. I addressed this in my essay for The Occidental Observer titled &#8220;A Party of Plutocrats has No Future.&#8221; The Republicans can maximize White electoral solidarity by moving to the left on economics. The free-trade-and-less-government ideology is what defeated Mitt Romney in 2012, by repelling the White working class outside of the South.</p>
<p>(2) that only Whites will vote against non-White immigration. In fact about half of the Black population understands that immigration is bad for them, and very likely could be persuaded to regard immigration as a key issue with an appropriate publicity-campaign by the Republicans or by some conservative group.</p>
<p>(3) that the government of the United States will always be determined by the vote of a majority. The more scandals there are about rigged voting, such as occurred during the 2000 general presidential election and the 2012 Republican primaries, the less legitimacy the elected government of the United States will retain, and the more feasible its replacement with an autocracy will become. When electoral corruption is a well known fact, that is a green light for a military coup.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think they mean the physical act of visiting a voting booth and casting a ballot. They seem to have this idea that the business of organizing political campaigns or political action committees consumes time and resources that would be better spent organizing for something else - insurrection would be my guess. They are somewhat wrong on this count also, however, since secessionist parties have routinely combined electoral politics with extra-legal operations. </p>
<p>The problem for now is that white racial issues are only the tiniest bleep on the mainstream cultural radar. That&rsquo;s why the meta-political activity of framing and drawing attention to such issues is some of the most important work that can be done today. Widespread recognition of white racial concerns would be a seismic shift in political consciousness, easily comparable to that which took place over the civil rights era. If or when that occurs, it&rsquo;s game-on; if it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s disqus blogs all the way to the bitter end. </p>

Whites fought back in the 60s and had guns put in their faces and there has been no fight since, only capitulation and despair. Despair and existential crisis does not inspire strength. Europe will lead the way I feel, if a nationalist victory can happen there, then it will embolden and inspire. But it will not come from the US. If it does not, it will probably be many centuries of living in crap conditions until we&rsquo;re bred out, because that is reality and that is what history has shown to happen time and time again to fallen empires and ethnicities. The dream of little white power nations is just that. You think the non-white majority US would allow a mini-white separate nation to exist? It&rsquo;d be crushed in a second. Even in the 90s the hysteria over militias proves that any kind of nationalist movement will fail. Invading Canada is our best bet, either by cooperation or force. And the melting of the ice will provide more usable land for a large white nation.</p>

Basically, the defeatists are correct, in that White America&rsquo;s goose is well and truly cooked, and the country is lost forever. If anything, massive non-White immigration will only *increase* in the future.<br/>
So what can be done? The obvious answer is the horrible dysfunction that typifies Brazil and most of Latin America. The model of the American future already exists. Possibly, there might be a White seccesionist movement, or some sort of political movement explicitly championing White consciousness and separation - but don&rsquo;t bank on it. Remember that the most vicious, evil, nasty, fanatic, low-down enemy of Whites are other Whites.<br/>
Who knows. It&rsquo;s very, very hard to make specific predictions for the future, the best that can be done is to extrapolate general &#8216;broad-brush&rsquo; trends that exist and will continue to exist, but we must be wary of the jokers-in-the-pack, the game changers&rsquo; the &#8216;black swans&rsquo; that magically swipe the board in a remarkable fashion, but overall I would expect the same continual drub-drub-drub to go on.</p>

<p>- Hubert Collins, American Renaissance, April 1, 2015</p>
<p>In the United States the crime rate has been declining since 1980.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hubert Collins is right that a white ethnostate is a hopeless aspiration. </p>
<p>On the other hand, more immigrants mean more people. More people mean that there is less of everything good to go around. </p>
<p>Moreover, non Asian minorities have considerably lower IQ averages than those of European stock. </p>
<p>These truths have political implications. As time goes on the truth will become more obvious.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-747405" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Great article with lots of great points.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate and underline a few very important points that the article made:</p>
<p>1. Worse is not necessarily better.</p>
<p>This is so true. Things can just get worse. People use this argument as an excuse for accepting political defeats. It&rsquo;s an argument which leads to complacency and apathy.</p>
<p>2. Collins mentions that Donovan hopes for some sort of collapse to happen in the future. </p>
<p>This is another stupid, flawed thing to hope for or count on.</p>
<p>There may never be the kind of collapse that Donovan&rsquo;s hoping for. It&rsquo;s possible, but not certain. Far from certain. It may be that the U.S. slowly declines into a second or third world majority non-white country where elites are still able to keep total political and cultural control. What is our plan for that possibility? Of course, no white nationalist rockstar writer ever speculates about this possibility because it&rsquo;s not as glamorous as a Hollywood-style complete, sudden collapse scenario. I would just add that for being a &#8220;movement&#8221; which pins its hopes on collapse scenarios, we aren&rsquo;t particularly great students of how such things happen or how to prepare for them. I doubt we&rsquo;d do well if a collapse did happen someday - we&rsquo;d be caught flat footed.</p>
<p>3. Spencer, Donovan, Covington are fools for giving up on electoral politics. </p>
<p>One can do both. One can do multiple things at once. Or maybe they can&rsquo;t - but the rest of us can.</p>
<p>4. Immigration is the most important mainstream issue for us to rally around and plant our flag on.</p>
<p>Immigration is the one mainstream issue where we can enter into the debate and argue our side in a way that most white people will understand and possibly be won over by. They get it. Most white people are already white dissidents if you look at polling which says that white people really hate illegal immigration and wish that illegal immigrants would go home rather than be granted citizenship.</p>
<p>Immigration is the perfect issue for us to step up and say &#8220;it&rsquo;s okay for white people to not want to become a minority&#8221; - which, if you think about it, is another way of saying that it&rsquo;s okay for white people to be racially conscious and to organize politically around racial interests.</p>
<p>Spencer, Donovan, Covington, and the like are fools for missing this opportunity. They seem to think that because they haven&rsquo;t been able to successfully reach the mainstream so far that there aren&rsquo;t lessons to be learned and other messages to be tried. They just give up and become defeatists, content to run lame ass websites.</p>
<p>Hopefully the next generation of white dissidents will be better thinkers. Most of the edifice of past white racialism in this country needs to be abandoned as pointless, increasingly irrelevant, dead weight. Hopefully our youth are brave enough to do this abandoning. </p>
<p>Sadly this edifice that needs to be abandoned includes most websites that have sprung up over the past 15 years (Radix, Alt-Right, Counter-Currents, Daily Stormer). Jared Taylor, on the other hand, stands above the rest as someone with a remarkable intellect, clear communicator, and a firm grasp on the real world.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s certainly true, but I think what accounts for the failure of so many WN outfits to run with it is their awareness that it&rsquo;s an incomplete solution (if one accepts WN premises) and their consequent fear that it&rsquo;ll be 1924 all over again, so to speak. That is, yes, immigration was restricted (albeit imperfectly), but with that task accomplished the coalition that achieved it simply faded away. A mere fifteen years later the America First Committee that sprang up to keep the USA out of what was to become WWII was already but a pale shadow of the Immigration Restriction League&rsquo;s political influence, and things only ever got worse thereafter. </p>
<p>A key difference between then and now, however, is that the IRL sympathizers could be forgiven for thinking that, with immigration restricted, all would be well. After all, America was still overwhelmingly northwest European, racial consciousness was widespread, mainstream culture supported white identity and white societies were protected by segregation. None of that holds true today. If immigration were halted tomorrow no one would think that the WN&rsquo;s job is done. There is every reason to think that the energies formerly contributed to restricting immigration would then seamlessly transfer to some new racial political objective. Immigration-boosters, it seems to me, understand this far better than WNs.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-747420" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>For many nations, America included, I think the time for playing politics and dreaming about there being any real democracy in these matters is coming to a close. It is without question important to try - providing that people do not just drift along in the hope that something magic will happen. </p>
<p>This is where the scenario of community building comes in. It will take decades to build strong communities that are not going to be washed away ideologically or by other means. We do not have decades left. Efforts are perhaps well spent looking at this route, as we need to have some kind of back-up plan. </p>
<p>However, the article is right in that we cannot just ceasing to care about immigration because it is &#8220;already too late&#8221;. The wise thing to do is to do more than one thing at once. </p>
<p>There would be nothing stopping community builders from lobbying and voting for anti-immigration candidates - and there is nothing stopping those voters looking at other options than just voting and lobbying. </p>
<p>The difficult thing is no doubt deciding how much of our limited time, money and effort to spend in each direction. This is where people need to develop a bit more co-ordination of efforts instead of all slogging away in isolation (and disagreements).</p>

<p>3. Gun Control. A losing proposition repeatedly struck down by the Courts and repeatedly struck down by the electorate. The fact is that 90% of the crime is negro on everyone else and everyone else wants to defend themselves from the negro. Here in the future Homeland, Bill Gates and a few other Billionaires sign a check and we get Prop-495, a gun control bill that even the sponsors can&#8221;t figure out what it means. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-747647" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Increased incarceration rates explain a large part of the drop, but I think an underrated explanation is that society really has become more tolerant and accepting of difference. Regardless of what one thinks about that, it has certain social effects, and one of those has been people who&rsquo;d formerly felt embittered by their exclusion now feel that they have something to gain from productive participation in society. Consequently, the chances that such people fall into a habit of criminal behaviour are diminished. Put simply, it&rsquo;s much easier to become a criminalistic, antisocial a-hole if you think society hates you and is out to get you. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, although crime rates have decreased even as the proportion of Hispanics has significantly risen, it&rsquo;s important not to lose sight of the fact that Hispanics are more criminal than whites. Excluding Caribbean types, Hispanics are somewhere between 1.5 to 3 times as criminal as whites (WN analyses tend towards the higher figure, anti-WNs towards the former). Therefore we should assume that crime would have decreased <i>even more</i> had there not been the Hispanic influx. </p>

<p>During the War in Vietnam I was in the anti war movement. In retrospect I think that movement prolonged the War in Vietnam. Anti war demonstrators with their traffic disruptions, their vandalism, and their expressions of anti American and pro Communist sentiment angered the voters and provoked them to vote for hawkish politicians who continued the war effort.</p>
<p>By 1971 public opinion polls indicated that most Americans disliked the War in Vietnam, and disliked the war protesters even more.</p>
<p>Most of us in the anti war movement were not foul mouthed, promiscuous flag burners who seldom bathed. Unfortunately, enough were to make the stereotype plausible.</p>
<p>There is another movement that changed the political situation in the United States in a few months without a single demonstration. This was the tax revolt. When Proposition 13 was passed in California reducing property taxes America was a different country.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. General Social Survey 25 percent of all Americans want immigration &#8220;reduced a little&#8221; and 27 percent want immigration &#8220;reduced a lot.&#8221; Immigration is an issue on which race realists can be effective if we act intelligently and realistically. </p>
<p>Another issue is with the basic truths of race realism, especially as explained by Professor J. Philippe Rushton in his &#8220;Race, Evolution, and Behavior.&#8221; As more is learned about the human genome, and as racial differences persist despite efforts to erase them, the truths of race realism will become more obvious, and more difficult to suppress.</p>
<p>Race realism is not a movement. It is a scientific theory with political implications.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-747790" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Intellectually I agree with all of the arguments in this article. I admire Peter Brimelow for the work that he does and Jeff Sessions and Steve King for their leadership on the immigration issue. But emotionally I side with Richard Spencer, especially after the Republicans failed to do anything to block Obama&rsquo;s patently unconstitutional executive amnesty. I just don&rsquo;t see any way to put together a political coalition to even significantly restrict immigration, let alone the 40 year moratorium on mass immigration that might give us some kind of a chance at assimilation of what we have. Democrats see immigrants as cheap votes, Republicans as cheap labor; neither paty cares about the white American middle and working class, and the demographic changes mean that neither party may have to in 20-30 years; So I visit the vDare site with less and less interest these days.</p>
<p>Although I agree that discussions of armed rebellion have an air of unreality, I don&rsquo;t think they can be entirely dismissed as pure fantasy. Imagine a world in 10-15 years with the U.S; involved in wars all over the world (South American, Africa, Middle and Near East, possibly even Asia, and very dangerous conflicts with Russia in Ukraine or the Baltic). The regular military is overextended and possibly suffers a couple of serious defeats. The governors of North and South Dakota, Montana and Idaho order their state national guards to disarm any federal troops, and state police to arrest federal judges and U;S. marshals. The ICBM fields are captured. The governors order the national guards to resist any territorial incusions but not to initiate any offensive actions. State legislatures pass articles of succession and offer to negotiate a peaceful withdrawal from the United States. They perhaps even appeal to Canada for assistance and protection. Under those circumstances, what alternatives would the national government have?</p>

<p>I think the more likely drastic shift will be that when automation makes most people redundant and unemployable, it will wind up being an economic change that begets political changes. I think what&rsquo;s more likely to happen is that it will be the time when the iron is hot for NRx to strike. Meaning ethnonationalist monarchism.</p>

Because that country is going to disappear, probably forever. Soon enough america will be a nation of 400-500 million mostly third world people.

That&rsquo;s why third parties never get any traction here. In many European countries if your party gets 10% of the vote you get representation in the parliament. In America if your party gets 10% of the vote you get zero representation in the government. And of course the mass media conspires to maintain the two party duopoly. Good luck getting your candidate invited to any debate if he&rsquo;s not a Republican or Democrat.</p>
<p>And even in Europe every so called &#8220;mainstream&#8221; right leaning party teams up with socialists and Communists to block the power of insurgent nationalist parties like the National Front.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-749164" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I agree with Hubert Collins, we should continue to focus on opposing bad immigration. Along with opposing Black crime, Black anarchy, Black welfare abuse - it&rsquo;s our best issue, Whites can and do come out to support local guys who take the lead in opposing bad immigration. Sherif Joe A in Arizona is the most popular local guy. We knocked out Eric Cantor, Chris Cannon and to a lesser extent Dick Lugar over their immigration treasons.</p>
<p>Sure, our few victories get pushed aside by the Obama admin and the GOP plutocracy, Agribusiness traitors like Tyson Foods CEO Donny Smith, but my view is that the issue helps empower local heroes.</p>
<p>Rudy Guliani rose to power and fame by opposing, reversing Black crime, Black anarchy in New York City. New local heroes can and must rise to power opposing bad immigration.</p>
<p>We need many more pro White mayors, sheriffs, county board chairmen - let&rsquo;s find some winners and back them in Governor&rsquo;s races. We need new, powerful immigration patriot Governors who will work for real separation from corrupt Washington the media elite in LA and New York City.</p>
<p>Sure, at the Presidential level, elections are all fixed and immigration patriots have little or no shot at winning anything. The Presidential election is just a circus anyway, Zionist oligarchs and Christian Zionist idiots, New Con media - yeah, totally fixed. But it isn&rsquo;t that way at city, county and to a lesser degree state levels.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s double down and go state and local and find, empower immigration patriots. When we have power at the state and local levels we can start to work for real, secession, separation.</p>
<p>Giving up on immigration is, well just giving up.</p>

Also, an ill-fated new party that will be interpreted as being racist just wouldn&rsquo;t get much momentum. It would be more productive to focus on sneakier immigration issues like restriction of the social safety net. If that wasn&rsquo;t accessible for people who weren&rsquo;t currently citizens or people capable of getting legitimate work visas it wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense for anyone to move here from a less competitive economy unless they were individually exceptional.It wouldn&rsquo;t just be preventative; you&rsquo;d actually get rid of people. Throw in the removal of certain visa caps-which, in my experience, tend to arbitrarily thin out the number of Europeans who come here for college that can actually stay-and you can make it look pro-immigration, at least enough that the liberal media narrative can&rsquo;t attack it effectively.</p>
