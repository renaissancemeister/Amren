<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shelby Steele, <em>Shame: How America&rsquo;s Past Sins Have Polarized the Country</em>, Basic Books, 2015, $25.99, 198 pp.</strong></p>
<p>Every few years we can count on Shelby Steele for a <a href="#article1">thoughtful analysis</a> of the American dilemma, and <em>Shame</em>, his latest offering, does not disappoint. Dr. Steele, who has been a Hoover Institution fellow since 1994, is one of that distinguished handful of blacks who despise the victim identity, and who insist that blacks must rise or fall according to their merits. He is also a keen observer of whites-having a white mother and a white wife probably helps-and ruthlessly dissects their motives.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Shame.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113727" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Shame.jpg" alt="Shame" width="362" height="550"/></a></p>
<p>In this book, to quote its subtitle, Dr. Steele tries to explain how America&rsquo;s past sins have polarized the country. The worst of those sins was &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; along with &ldquo;sexism,&rdquo; environmental plunder, and a pointless war in Southeast Asia, but Dr. Steele&rsquo;s central question is whether &ldquo;racism&rdquo; is still the abiding American sin or has diminished to the point of little consequence.</p>
<p>Dr. Steele believes it is of little consequence, but the Left has built a nearly impregnable moral position on the opposite view: that whites are oppressors virtually by instinct, and continue to ruin the lives of non-whites. Blacks, of course, have swarmed to this position, because it excuses their failings and keeps whites in a state of supplication, but Dr. Steele argues that it also makes them prisoners of victimhood and clients of white generosity. Dr. Steel gets an awful lot right-his prose is clear, sometimes even beautiful-but he has blind spots that keep him from seeing the entire picture.</p>
<div id="attachment_113729" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ShelbySteele.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-113729" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ShelbySteele.jpg" alt="Shelby Steele" width="550" height="365"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shelby Steele</p></div>
<p><strong>The 1960s</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Steele traces the roots of today&rsquo;s polarization to the 1960s, which he says were &ldquo;arguably the worst crisis of moral and cultural authority in [America&rsquo;s] history.&rdquo; The slogan &ldquo;Never trust anyone over 30&rdquo; could have arisen only in a period of deep skepticism and alienation.</p>
<p>Dr. Steele is right to say that it all began with race: &ldquo;The civil rights movement was the first movement in the 1960s to win legitimacy because its charges against America were so blatantly true.&rdquo; Legal discrimination unquestionably violated statements about equality that have always haunted the republic, and the moral thrill of battling &ldquo;bigotry&rdquo; quickly spread to the battle against other newly invented &ldquo;isms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele writes that these battles became part of the spirit of his generation: &ldquo;America&rsquo;s evil would always provide us with a sense of purpose and destiny and even moral superiority.&rdquo; However, for blacks, he says those battles were a bad bargain because they made victimhood a permanent part of their identity. Blacks became &ldquo;more wedded to the idea of themselves as oppressed than to the reality that they are freer than ever,&rdquo; and they adopted &ldquo;a strategy that only keeps us victims even when the world, hesitantly or not, invites us to live as men and women.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Jobs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113730" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Jobs.jpg" alt="Jobs" width="550" height="364"/></a></p>
<p>Dr. Steele writes that agreeing to become perpetual victims turned blacks into &ldquo;contingent people,&rdquo; whose fate depended on other people&rsquo;s goodwill. The racial preferences by which whites expressed their goodwill also meant that no black could really claim to deserve success: &ldquo;There is at least a whisper of doubt over my entire generation of educated blacks-a whisper, frankly, of inferiority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Part of the problem was &ldquo;black pride.&rdquo; Too many blacks believed that afros and swagger could replace hard work and competence. &ldquo;Group identities that compensate for the deprived background of the individual with a grandiose vision of the group,&rdquo; he writes, are a false hope.</p>
<p>But playing the victim is irresistible: For blacks, &ldquo;grievance against their former oppressor is leverage, entitlement, and even self-esteem within the larger society. It is power.&rdquo; Where there are victims, there must be oppressors, and blacks quickly learned that whites lived in terror of being thought of as oppressors. Blacks learned they could humiliate and exploit whites by threatening to withhold the blessing that whites craved: recognition that they were not &ldquo;racists.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong> &ldquo;Poetic truth&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>But how do you sniff out and exploit oppressors in a world in which oppression has diminished to almost nothing? By creating a giant lie-by believing what Dr. Steele calls &ldquo;poetic truth.&rdquo; Just as poets take license with the truth to achieve artistic effects, the Left distorts the truth so it can keep peddling tales of oppression. Dr. Steele sees America differently:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are a black and you want to be a poet, or a doctor, or a corporate executive, or a movie star, there will surely be barriers to overcome, but white racism will be among the least of them. You will be far more likely to receive racial preferences than to suffer racial discrimination.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the Left, however, &ldquo;the victimization of blacks (and other minorities) is <em>always</em> the larger truth of American life, a truth so much a part of America&rsquo;s fundamental character that it must always be taken as literal truth even when the facts refute it.&rdquo; The basic poetic truth is that all failings of blacks and Hispanics are due to white oppression, but new truths are added all the time. Since the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012, it has been established that white vigilantes hunt down and kill unarmed blacks. 2014 gave birth to the poetic truth that white policemen murder unarmed blacks with impunity. This year will no doubt produce its own crop of poetry.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HandsUp.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113731" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HandsUp.jpg" alt="HandsUp" width="550" height="389"/></a></p>
<p>Phony truths of this kind make it impossible for the Left to understand their own country, but they give it tremendous leverage because, as Dr. Steele explains, there is &ldquo;so much moral and political power in the idea of delivering blacks from their tragic past.&rdquo; Poetic truth is a lie that supports an ideological position, but it is also the essential buttress for &ldquo;political correctness,&rdquo; which Dr. Steele describes as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has no other purpose than to project these sins [of racism, etc.] as the essential, if not the eternal, truth of the American way of life. Then political correctness tries to bully and shame Americans-on pain of their human decency-into conformity with this ugly view of their society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone who points out that blacks face very little discrimination is a dissident who must be put down, and poetic truth gives the Left &ldquo;the power to shame and stigmatize all who oppose it.&rdquo; As Dr. Steel emphasizes, the poetic truth isn&rsquo;t about truth; it&rsquo;s about power.</p>
<p><strong>How whites think</strong></p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s in it for whites? They still set the bounds of political discussion. Why paint such a dark picture of their own race? Dr. Steele argues that it is because condemning their own race is how liberals exhibit virtue.</p>
<p>All whites have been trapped by a shift in what it means to be moral. Until the 1950s, private virtue was the measure of goodness. As the &rsquo;60s mentality took hold, goodness began to depend on explicit opposition to all the alleged American evils, especially &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; The expression of certain views-rather than virtuous acts-became an important moral standard. You could still get in trouble for ordinary misbehavior, but you could be fired from your job and stripped of respectability merely for expressing forbidden views.</p>
<p>Very few whites actually <em>do </em>anything that could be considered &ldquo;racist;&rdquo; today it is all words. Whites must therefore constantly watch what they say because a few syllables can put them at the mercy of liberals and non-whites, who have the power either to pass sentence or forgive. This infuses the lives of whites with a special terror: &ldquo;The terror of being seen as racist-a terror that has caused whites to act guiltily toward minorities even when they feel no guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the many things whites must not say-and even Dr. Steele says it at his risk-is that since &ldquo;racism&rdquo; is not a major barrier to blacks, they generally get what they deserve. For liberals, anyone who denies pervasive &ldquo;racism&rdquo; is, himself, an unwitting or even deliberate accomplice to &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; The only route to virtue is to recognize the deeply oppressive nature of the country and to denounce it at every opportunity. The perverse result, says Dr. Steele, is that only by denouncing their own country and race can whites enjoy &ldquo;the good opinion of themselves as decent and socially concerned people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FairSkin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113732" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FairSkin.jpg" alt="FairSkin" width="550" height="379"/></a></p>
<p>The only way whites can be sure of never being tarred as &ldquo;racist&rdquo; is to endorse race-preference programs and claim to worship &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; But for Dr. Steele, even though &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; is supposed to help brown people, it helps only white people. Throwing incompetent non-whites in over their heads does them no good, but it is &ldquo;a shield against charges of racism and sexism.&rdquo; Non-whites are pawns in these rituals of expiation.</p>
<p><strong>Liberals and conservatives</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Steele believes that America is more ideologically divided than at any time since the Civil War. He thinks this is a direct result of the moral revolution of the 1960s that unmasked the United States as racist, sexist, materialist, etc. The &ldquo;poetic truth&rdquo; of the liberals is that the country still groans under these sins, whereas conservatives believe that most people get a pretty fair deal.</p>
<p>Conservatives therefore preach individual responsibility and hard work, whereas liberals think government must step in and make up for a rigged game. In Dr. Steele&rsquo;s view, &ldquo;Liberalism in the twenty-first century is, for the most part, a moral manipulation that exaggerates inequity and unfairness in American life in order to justify overreaching public policies and programs.&rdquo; Only government activism can shoehorn minorities into the equality they deserve.</p>
<p>The problem for conservatives who preach meritocracy is that white men used to get a leg up. By repudiating discrimination and oppression, liberals claim to have broken decisively with that dark past, and accuse conservatives of using meritocracy as a cover for the same old biases that beat down women and non-whites.</p>
<p>Dr. Steel explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>This remains liberalism&rsquo;s great advantage over conservatism-its glib dissociation from the past quickly restores legitimacy to [liberal-dominated] American institutions. Conservatism has no quick dissociative mechanism. It lumbers along, struggling with difficult principles-principles that even ask America&rsquo; former victims to take considerable responsibility for their own advancement. Conservatism doesn&rsquo;t offer dissociation. Thus, in a culture won over by dissociation, conservatism seems to be in association with America&rsquo;s evil past.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conservative ideas always have to swim upstream against charges of bigotry. Thus, writes Dr. Steel, &ldquo;It is conservatives who now feel evicted from their culture, who are made to feel like outsiders even as they are accused of being traditionalists.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NotRacist.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113733" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NotRacist.jpg" alt="NotRacist" width="550" height="367"/></a></p>
<p>America either is seething with racism and sexism or it is not. These views cannot be reconciled, so to call oneself liberal or conservative is to adopt an almost tribal identity that thrives on hostility towards the other camp. Ideological opponents no longer see each other as two sides of the same coin: Opponents &ldquo;are a different coin altogether, a fundamentally illegitimate and alien force&rdquo; and this justifies the &ldquo;bitterness and contempt&rdquo; one tribe feels for the other.</p>
<p>Dr. Steele&rsquo;s conservatism is deeply libertarian. He believes that freedom is better than government intervention even if freedom sometimes means non-whites bring up the rear. He thinks, in fact, that government handouts are destructive, because they reward the degeneracy that breaks up black families. He believes that if the country could turn its back on &ldquo;paternalistic intervention inspired by white guilt&rdquo; it would send a clear message to blacks that their success depends on their efforts alone. If blacks rejected victimhood and trusted in America&rsquo;s willingness to reward effort, there would be a true flowering of black ability. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; writes Dr. Steele, &ldquo;this was precisely the model of advancement that blacks followed in sports and music to such great success. . . . Wouldn&rsquo;t this model work in engineering or medicine or business?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The flaw in the argument</strong></p>
<p>No, this model would not work in engineering or medicine or business. It wouldn&rsquo;t because there are racial differences that prevent blacks from succeeding in these fields at the same rate as whites. Surely, Dr. Steele must realize that if blacks were as talented in engineering as they are in basketball, not even race preferences and a victim identity would have held them back. It may be that blacks are discouraged to some degree by the fear the Left drums into them that nasty white people are waiting at every turn to trip them up, but blacks with real talent and drive can succeed in any field.</p>
<p>This book, like so many others, falls apart logically because it refuses to face up to race differences in ability. It is those differences that produce the yawning gaps in achievement that make &ldquo;poetic truth&rdquo; plausible. If race differences in ability are a forbidden concept, only &ldquo;racism&rdquo; is left to explain those gaps. And it is because pure meritocracy always results in these otherwise inexplicable gaps that the Left can plausibly accuse whites of holding blacks down.</p>
<p>Nor is the current arrangement the terrible deal for blacks Dr. Steele makes it out to be. If race preferences and the victim mentality really did sap the vitality of black minds and caused stark gaps in achievement, Dr. Steele would be right. But they don&rsquo;t have that effect. Most blacks get to about the level they deserve. Affirmative action then lifts some of them higher, and it doesn&rsquo;t leave them writhing in agonies of self-doubt. Most are obviously convinced they deserve to go even higher!</p>
<p>Nor should Dr. Steele be so quick to dismiss the racial hierarchy of pre-1960s America. Ever since the arrival of blacks on this continent, Americans have stumbled about, trying to find a way for two starkly dissimilar groups to live together. There was injustice in slavery and Jim Crow, but is there no injustice in today&rsquo;s pretentions of equality?</p>
<p>We are out of options. We have tried them all and they all failed. Blacks and whites see the world differently. The fabricated melodramas of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner are only the latest differences that cannot be reconciled. Blacks like Dr. Steele, who understand the pathological relationship between black power and white guilt, will always be a minority. The only solution is for blacks to run their own societies as they see fit and leave whites to run theirs. That is the only way blacks will finally learn the lesson Dr. Steele wants them to learn: that their fate is in their hands, and not in ours.</p>

<p>White liberal guilt was understandable during the late 1960&rsquo;s and early 1970&rsquo;s. First, racial discrimination was a recent memory. It was easier then than it is now to blame racial discrimination for black deficiencies. Second, white liberals and radicals wanted black allies in the protest movement against the War in Vietnam. </p>
<p>Two generations after the civil rights legislation was passed it should be obvious to perceptive white liberals that the five years of black ghetto rioting that followed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and more durable increases in black crime and illegitimacy, caused white blue collar workers to leave the Democratic Party, and made the United States a Republican country. </p>
<p>In addition, many white liberals have had the experience of losing university admissions and job opportunities because of affirmative action policies.</p>

These authors like to say Black and White but really the worst part of the guilt is set aside by all groups to be directed solely towards White Men. White Women benefited directly from the civil rights movement and until Affirmative Action is either totally repealed or White Women are actually grouped with White Men we will be a race divided. Certainly the racist shroud has been used against White Women but it has also been used by them for their own gain.</p>
<p>Bottom line White Guilt remains because it actually benefits many White Women to keep it going.</p>

The first &#8220;Affirmative&#8221; Action programs only conferred benefits on women and Blacks. Then it was inflated to eventually include all  except white (heterosexual?) males. This has done considerable damage to women, who are lumped with all non-White males, in preferential treatment. Yet Feminists and less extreme woman&rsquo;s advocates never seem to have protested this loss to White women.</p>

<p>They make people AFRAID to disagree with them. That is it. That is what every item in the news is attempting to do, make you afraid to depart from the straight and narrow (their straight and narrow). Perhaps it is about power (and one might say empowering &#8216;criminals&rsquo; - certainly the bullies) but fear is what makes it succeed. </p>
<p>And that is interesting, because for now it is mostly words (and I do think leftists intend there to be violence behind it - that&rsquo;s just my opinion), now it is mostly words,  but in the future it will be real physical fear of blacks beside them which will control their expressions and even thoughts.</p>

<p>Perhaps reason will save us? I suspect most Whites have become racially aware over the last two decades they are just quiet about it (and afraid). I&rsquo;m reminded of the phrase that recently appeared in chat on these pages, except in our case it should be &#8216;Don&rsquo;t trust anyone under 30&#8243;.</p>
<p>Perhaps a strong leader will emerge? Well, I know a White leader will emerge. I think David Duke is right in this regard. For what exact purpose would be the question? Will some kind of White leader, in the news media, somehow pacify poor White men and prevent them from unrest. Will it keep them working? Will it keep women and people of color from feeling too guilty? Will Whites in the news and complaining about being victims (and really being victims) finally in a sense empower blacks? Will the preplanned collapse of Whites, as they become &#8216;poor victims&rsquo;, too, will this discredit victimology (the world simply needs workers)? Is empowering such a figure simply the right thing to do (finally at last we get this right)?</p>
<p>I suspect American voters will either vote for racial separation or for a White reservation for Whites in the Pacific Northwest. An Israel of our own so to speak. I&rsquo;m going for the presidential election of 2044. That is a date that might seem incredibly optimistic, at the current rate of progress, never-the-less that will be my prediction. </p>
<p>The longer we wait (and at some point it could potentially be too long), the less we will be left with.</p>

I just hate supporting useless low IQ people, of any ethnicity, and their poorly planned large families. I hate that hard working whites are forced to pay at least a third of their income so welfare recipients can squat out litters of low IQ offspring. And it just so happens that a very large number of these welfare recipients are not white. Sure, there are useless or lazy whites who also abuse the system. But multigenerational welfare is not a way of life for a huge percentage of white people. The same cannot be said for blacks or mexicans. So I believe that my concerns regarding this issue are completely valid.</p>

Prior to the inception of the war on poverty blacks were employed at a higher rate than whites, 75-85% of all black children were raised by two parent households and you had much lower rates of crime. Its the welfare state that creates the dysfunction.</p>

In the past much less black children were born fatherless to a single mother. Now in modern America the state is the new &#8220;baby daddy&#8221;, resulting in around two thirds of black babies being born to a single mother, and the financial burden of raising their child or in many cases numerous children, born to the least intelligent and least productive segments of society falls upon the most productive and most intelligent segment, which in turn causes them to be unable to support a large family of their own, due to financial concerns and time constraints. Clearly this is going to have a degenerative effect on society eventually.</p>

<p>So, you disagree with the SCOTUS decision that &#8220;money&#8221; is speech? The &#8220;money is speech&#8221; concept is somewhat akin to &#8220;equal protection under the law&#8221; except those who can afford the &#8220;best&#8221; lawyers get the best protection &#8220;under the law&#8221;. At some level, I agree with you that money in politics is problematic, I simply don&rsquo;t agree that the answer is to give government more power by having it fund elections, though some form of that concept may be the answer.</p>
<p>Speaking of &#8220;equal corruption&#8221;, IIRC, Dems have more 1%ers than Repubs which makes one wonder about money being an agent of &#8220;corruption&#8221;. My sense is that corruption is an equal opportunity agent, and spreads itself equally among people.</p>

<p>It is, at essence, a description of the methods used by governments worldwide to kill their people during the 20th century.

<p>Also, (not too familiar with Cambodia at all, I admit) Stalin killed a bunch a people through bad planning, ruthlessness, and malice.

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-761448" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Keynes&rsquo; economic theories have never been discredited, and certainly not by you. </p>
<p>In The Communist Manifesto Karl Marx pointed out that the natural tendencies of capitalism are to accumulate wealth and power at the top, and to experience increasingly destructive economic downturns. </p>
<p>This did happen from the publication of The Communist Manifesto in 1848 to the Great Depression. By following the policies of Keynes the Roosevelt administration countered these tendencies. The result was America&rsquo;s recovery from the Great Depression, and the expansion of America&rsquo;s middle class.</p>
<p>The stagflation of the 1970&rsquo;s began with the inflationary recession of 1974. This was caused by the OPEC Oil Embargo which followed the Yom Kipper War of 1973. This appeared to discredit Keynesian policies, because he argued that inflation reduced unemployment, and that unemployment reduced inflation. </p>
<p>From 1974 to 1983 unemployment and inflation rose together. However, Keynes&rsquo; policies were not intended to deal with the shortage of an essential natural resource, as petroleum was and is. During the Great Depression inflation was not a problem; deflation was. </p>
<p>The inflation that lasted from 1974 to 1983 was due to fluctuations in the world price of petroleum, over which neither Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan had much control. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stagflation was used by the Reagan administration as an excuse to repeal the policies of John Maynard Keynes, which reactionaries had never liked. As a result, the tendencies in capitalism that Karl Marx drew attention to are again becoming apparent: wealth and income are being concentrated at the top; recessions are longer, more severe, and followed by what are called &#8220;jobless recoveries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet the story of economics over the past half century is, to a large degree, the story of a retreat from Keynesianism and a return to neoclassicism. The neoclassical revival was initially led by Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago, who asserted as early as 1953 that neoclassical economics works well enough as a description of the way the economy actually functions to be &ldquo;both extremely fruitful and deserving of much confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &#8220;I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable. But the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind, legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property, only taking care to let their subdivisions go hand in hand with the natural affections of the human mind. The descent of property of every kind therefore to all the children, or to all the brothers and sisters, or other relations in equal degree is a politic measure, and a practicable one. Another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, and to tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise. Whenever there is in any country, uncultivated lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right. The earth is given as a common stock for man to labour and live on. If, for the encouragement of industry we allow it to be appropriated, we must take care that other employment be furnished to those excluded from the appropriation. If we do not the fundamental right to labour the earth returns to the unemployed. It is too soon yet in our country to say that every man who cannot find employment but who can find uncultivated land, shall be at liberty to cultivate it, paying a moderate rent. But it is not too soon to provide by every possible means that as few as possible shall be without a little portion of land. The small landholders are the most precious part of a state.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, he was not talking about &#8220;progressive taxation&#8221;.</p>

<p> It seems like Jefferson was lamenting the fact that much, very much of the land was lying fallow, and he was trying to figure a way to allow many un-employed, landless people the opportunity to make that land productive:</p>

<p>Jefferson&rsquo;s sympathies were with ordinary citizens, and against merchants and aristocrats. </p>
<p>During Jefferson&rsquo;s life private property qualifications for voting restricted the vote to the well to do. Consequently, the government sided with property against the populace. For example, in England there were no minimum wage laws. There were maximum wage laws. </p>
<p>This is why Jefferson was suspicious of a large and powerful government. He knew nothing of the conditions we would face during and since the industrial revolution.</p>

<p>Of course he knew nothing of those conditions, but he surely knew human nature and was quite the scientist of his time. </p>
<p>And as to his restrictions of voting, I tend to agree with him. In those times, the propertied class was the best educated. We are in dire need of many fewer &#8220;low information voters&#8221; today.</p>

I trust you also realize that the Democrats care nothing about the working class. Today&rsquo;s Democrat party is not the Democrats of yesteryear. I am amazed that you call yourself a Democrat, even though you are liberal on economic issues. Really, I do.</p>
<p>I could tolerate a Democrat party that champions the white working class. I cannot tolerate a party who thrives on identity politics, whose (seemingly) sole aim is to use minorities to demolish almost every healthy institution in this country.</p>

One was only allowed to think and speak in certain ways otherwise you were reported, arrested, interrogated, and shipped off to camps.  The Left has learned well from these tactics or perhaps they were part of the originators.</p>
<p>Blacks from the beginning were used to wrestle white power from whites in this country.  The propaganda and oppressive techniques have been so subtle in its effectiveness and gripe that the majority of whites have no idea of what have fallen over them and their countries being taken away from them.  The embracers and enforcers just like under Communism truly believe in their &ldquo;holy&rdquo; cause. </p>
<p>It is not just this country but all Western countries that this scheme has taken hold.  Other advanced countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea have been left alone because they would never submit to such tactics of guilt manipulation and atonement.  The Hispanics have also used blacks as &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; but these guilt manipulations would be laughed off.</p>

<p> I see great similarities between Calvinism and PC doctrine.  One of the prime tenants of Calvinism is original sin.  All Christianity does have this as far as I know, but the Calvinists really dwell upon it.  Calvinism really took hold in Northern and Western Europe, where most Americans whites come from and our culture certainly comes from.  There seems to be this deep seated urge in our people to feel bad about something and the new &#8220;original sin&#8221; is whiteness.</p>

But, I see the overall agenda is to destroy white societies using white guilt.  The social experiment was first tried on a smaller scale in former Rhodesia and South Africa using white guilt and racism.  It worked like a charm.  So, the question is asked why this agenda to destroy white majority countries?  Perhaps, they stand in the way of one world rule for the elites?</p>

you allude to another interesting aspect of multicultural culture that adds vibrancy to our lives.  What happens when it becomes even obvious to the street level African-American that they&rsquo;re being displaced.<br/>
One of the things that I use to understand this is that I was born in 1977.  In that year &#8220;hispanics&#8221; were less than half of the black population.  In 2015 they&rsquo;re a more than double the black population.<br/>
You&rsquo;d have to be &#8220;privileged white liberal&#8221; to believe their ideas are congruent.</p>

<p>The only stain that the Chinese caused on Tibet was the slaughter of somewhere around a million Tibetans during the Great Leap Forward. On the other hand, the Chinese killed many more of their own during the same period&hellip;</p>

They don&rsquo;t have a racial reason for it, it&rsquo;s just ideological business.

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-736345" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Communist capitalism still is part of the problem. I used to think communism and capitalism are absolutely incompatible, but now I understand that isn&rsquo;t the case. Liberalism and communism are just two sides of the same coin. Furthermore, if you want to see the parallels between communism and liberalism, then you should read these quotes in which Mao reveals himself as a Negro-worshipping anti-racist:</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>[The following is written by Mao.]</p>
<p>An American Negro leader now taking refuge in Cuba, Mr. Robert Williams, the former President of the Monroe, North Carolina, Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, has twice this year asked me for a statement in support of the American Negroes&rsquo; struggle against racial discrimmination. I wish to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Chinese people, to express our resolute support for the American Negroes in their struggle against racial discrimmination and for freedom and equal rights.</p>
<p>There are more than nineteen million Negroes in the United States, or about eleven per cent of the total population. Their position in society is one of enslavement, oppression and discrimmination. The overwhelming majority of the Negroes are deprived of their right to vote. On the whole it is only the most back-breaking and most despised jobs that are open to them. Their average wages are only from a third to a half of those of the white people. The ratio of unemployment among them is the highest. In many states they cannot go to the same school, eat at the same table, or travel in the same section of a bus or train with the white people. Negroes are frequently and arbitrarily arrested, beaten up and murdered by U.S. authorities at various levels and members of the Ku Klux Klan and other racists. About half of the American Negroes are concentrated in eleven states in the south of the United States. There, the discrimmination and prosecution they suffer are especially startling.</p>
<p>The American Negroes are awakening, and their resistance is growing ever stronger. In recent years the mass struggle of the American Negroes against racial discrimmination and for freedom and equal rights has been constantly developing.</p>
<p>In 1957 the Negro people in Little Rock, Arkansas, waged a fierce struggle against the barring of their children from public schools. The authorities used armed force against them, and there resulted the Little Rock incident which shocked the world.</p>
<p>In 1960 Negroes in more than twenty states held &lsquo;sit in&rsquo; demonstrations in protest against racial segregation in local restaurants, shops and other public places.</p>
<p>In 1961 the Negroes launched a campaign of &lsquo;freedom riders&rsquo; to oppose racial segregation in transport, a campaign which rapidly extended to many states.</p>
<p>In 1962 the Negroes in Mississippi fought for the equal right to enrol in colleges and were greeted by the authorities with repression which culminated in a blood bath.</p>
<p>This year, the struggle of the American Negroes started in early April in Birmingham, Alabama. Unarmed, bare-handed Negro masses were subjected to wholesale arrests and the most barbarous repression merely because they were holding meetings and parades against racial discrimmination. On 12 June, an extreme was reached with the cruel murder of Mr. Medgar Evers, a leader of the Negro people in Mississippi. These Negro masses, aroused to indignation and undaunted by ruthless violence, carried on their struggles even more courageously and quickly won the support of Negroes and all strata of the people throughout the United States. A gigantic and vigorous nationwide struggle is going on in nearly every state and city in the United States, and the struggle keeps mounting. American Negro organizations have decided to start a &lsquo;freedom march&rsquo; on Washington on 28 August, in which 2,50,000 people will take part.</p>
<p>The speedy development of the struggle of the American Negroes is a manifestation of the constant sharpening of class struggle and national struggle within the United States; it has been causing increasingly grave anxiety to the U.S. ruling clique. The Kennedy Administration has resorted to cunning two-faced tactics. On the one hand, it continues to connive at and take part in the discrimmination against and persecution of Negroes; it even sends troops to repress them. On the other hand, it is parading as an advocate the &lsquo;defence of human rights&rsquo; and the &lsquo;protection of the civil rights of Negroes&rsquo;, is calling upon the Negro people to exercise &lsquo;restraint&rsquo;, and is proposing to Congress so-called &lsquo;civil rights legislation&rsquo; in an attempt to numb the fighting will of the Negro people and deceive the masses throughout the country. However, these tactics of the Kennedy Administration are being seen through by more and more of the Negroes. The fascist atrocities committed by the U.S. imperialists against the Negro people have laid bare the true nature of the so-called democracy and freedom in the United States and revealed the inner link between the reactionary polices pursued by the U.S. Government at home and its policies of aggression abroad.</p>
<p>I call upon the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, enlightened elements of the bourgeoisie, and other enlightened personages of all colours in the world, white, black, yellow, brown, etc., to unite to oppose the racial discrimmination practiced by U.S. imperialism and to support the American Negroes in their struggle against racial discrimmination. In the final analysis, a national struggle is a question of class struggle. In the United States, it is only the reactionary ruling clique among the whites which is oppressing the Negro people. They can in no way represent the workers, farmers, revolutionary intellectuals, and other enlightened persons who comprise the overwhelming majority of the white people. At present, it is the handful of imperialists, headed by the United States, and their supporters, the reactionaries in different countries, who are carrying out oppression, aggression and intimidation against the overwhelming majority of the nations and peoples of the world. They are the minority, and we are the majority. At most they make up less than ten percent of the 3,000 million people of the world. I am deeply convinced that, with the support of more than ninety per cent of the people of the world, the just struggle of the American Negroes will certainly be victorious. The evil system of colonialism and imperialism grew on along with the enslavement of the Negroes and the trade in Negroes; it will surely come to its end with the thorough emancipation of the black people.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>[The following is about Mao&rsquo;s remarks to his African visitors.]</p>
<p>Chairman Mao Tse-tung received visitors from Africa here this afternoon [8 August 1963]. During the reception, Chairman Mao Tse-tung made a statement calling upon the people of the world to unite against racial discrimination by U.S. imperialism and support the American Negroes in their just struggle against racial discrimination.</p>
<p>Chairman Mao Tse-tung had a very cordial, friendly talk with the friends from Africa. During the talk, he condemned the racial discrimination practiced by U.S. imperialism, as well as that of the colonialist authorities of South Africa and in every part of the world. &ldquo;Racial discrimination&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;is found in Africa, in Asia, and in other parts of the world. The racial question is in essence a class question. Our unity is not one of race; it is the unity of comrades and friends. We should strengthen our unity and wage a common struggle against imperialism. colonialism, and the running dogs, to attain complete and thorough national independence and liberation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After explaining how China&rsquo;s revolutionary struggle had won through to victory, Chairman Mao said: &ldquo;This proves that a revolution by the people can triumph and that imperialism and its running clogs can be defeated. The tide of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism is sweeping through all Africa. All countries whether or not they have already attained independence, will sooner or later win complete and thorough independence and liberation. All the Chinese people support you. The people of Africa are awakening with each passing day; so are the people of the whole world. The workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals and all other revolutionary people, who constitute over ninety per cent of the world&rsquo;s population, can be united in the fight for the victory of the revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the fight for thorough emancipation,&rdquo; Chairman Mao said, &ldquo;the oppressed peoples rely first of all on their own strength and then, and only then, on international assistance. The people who have already won victory in their revolution should help those who are still struggling for liberation. This is our internationalist duty.&rdquo;</p>

I despise the &#8220;scholar&#8221; analyzed in this piece for his constant talking about the &#8220;evil sins&#8221; of America and the &#8220;sins&#8221; of the white race.  America was no worse than the rest of the world, but on the other hand, a whole lot better and it was white people who put an end to slavery.  That must be constantly hammered into people&hellip;white people stopped it.  Blacks (as a race) didn&rsquo;t stop it&hellip;there are blacks in Africa who still today have slaves.  And those freed American slaves who were sent back to Africa, what did they do when they got to Liberia?  They obtained for themselves slaves!  So in no way do &#8220;blacks&#8221; have the high moral ground regarding this issue.  And also, in Africa, think of how many of them are tribally murdering each other.  That&rsquo;s even worse than being racist; they&rsquo;ve carved hatred and the desire for the extermination of others into a finer slice than race; for them, it is tribal.</p>

Wouldn&rsquo;t this model work in engineering or medicine or business?&rdquo;&#8221;<br/>
This is the wall that all black conservatives or libertarians hit. The wall shaped like a bell curve. The &#8216;true flowering&rsquo; of black ability is to be seen in Africa. To expect more from blacks than what they are capable of is just cruel and unfair to them and to the whites and east asians that suffer the real, negative and racist effects of affirmative action.</p>

For most blacks history begins during American slavery and even that subject they know very little about.  Try having a conversation  about slavery with a black convert to Islam.   Such a person usually  converts to escape the white mans religion.  When you tell them about the Muslim slave trade  they react by accusing you of lying.  Any history that does not explicitly portray whites as the one and only  villian is either unknown to them or outright ignored.   The smarter blacks know there is no money in shaking down the ancestors of Arab or African slave traders. </p>

Basically old fashioned morality measured a man by his actions.  A man could be a part of a &#8220;bad&#8221; group but yet be moral and respected.</p>
<p>Now in the age of Social Justice, membership of a group denotes your level of morality. Also, group morality is built upon the foundation of ideas or concepts regarding groups and not individual behavior. Thus, once can be like Bill Clinton, for example, who is a notorious womanizer but is still respected by the SJW crowd because he has the correct ideas regarding groups. </p>
<p>Without going to far into detail this is how they arrive at the conclusion that is alright to &#8220;hate the haters&#8221; and there is no illogical contradiction because &#8220;haters&#8221; dislike groups because of their group status, the cardinal sin of our times.   Thus, a adulterous, liar and thief can morally condemn you, even if personally your conduct has been impeccable because you don&rsquo;t like adulterers as a group of people.  </p>
<p>The grand irony in all of this group think is promoted by the people who promote &#8220;individualism&#8221;.</p>

<p>America is Seething with racism and sexism directed at White men. White men are not considered human. They don&rsquo;t count at all. They count for zero. Anything could happen to White men and who would even know? They are completely ignored (outside of being named as the cause of everyone else&rsquo;s oppression). White men are in a position beneath zero. It&rsquo;s a negative to be a White man. If White men strain and strain to a super-humanly anti-racist they can potentially move themselves up to an even zero. Mr. Taylor fails to face up to reality, also. </p>
<p>&#8220;anyone who denies pervasive &ldquo;racism&rdquo; is, himself, an unwitting or even deliberate accomplice to &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good point. This sentence also could be used to describe the reaction to holocaust denial. Even saying the &#8216;racism&rsquo;, &#8216;isn&rsquo;t so bad&rsquo; is to be considered and accomplice to the racists.</p>

Most of the Blacks I worked with were mature adult males who never went past the eighth grade. ALL of them were from Mississippi or Alabama. ALL of them had migrated north to work in the auto industry. Some had simple requests, eg., being able to read a newspaper. I was successful with ninety percent of them. The Blacks I tutored in math were all current students. I honestly don&rsquo;t know exactly how many of them were officially &#8220;learning disabled&#8221;. One student in particular, I was absolutely sure was learning disabled. The remainder? I just don&rsquo;t know. They didn&rsquo;t understand. They also didn&rsquo;t seem to care. Is that the same, bottom line?</p>

<p>I was just struck by your examples, because those are specific examples of deficits that classically show up in people with LDs. Math LDs run in my own family. I can keep &#8220;clockwise/counter-clockwise&#8221; straight personally (although many people with LDs can&rsquo;t, as it&rsquo;s similar to the left-right confusion LDs can cause); but I couldn&rsquo;t read an analog clock at all until around age 13. I also didn&rsquo;t understand time concepts like &#8220;quarter hour&#8221; because fractions are not intuitive to me, and I needed to be taught their application to clocks very explicitly. I can now do it but it takes too much effort and careful thought to be worth it much of the time. I stick to digital watches and stuff. Not really a problem in 2015.</p>
<p>Of course, learning disabilities are defined as particular areas of weakness compared to overall ability and IQ. We know that 70-IQ blacks may not actually be &#8220;retarded&#8221; because that is within their normal range. Maybe some black people show more signs of what would be &#8220;learning disabled&#8221; in whites, but that is within normal range of ability for them and can&rsquo;t properly be considered a specific deficit? </p>
<p>Doubt we&rsquo;ll see study of this in psychoeducational literature.</p>

They never went beyond the eighth grade because apparently nobody in the south cared whether or not they dropped out to help their family earn a living. The men I tutored migrated to northern industrial states to earn a living. Every man I tutored was from the south. Every man I tutored did not make it past the eighth grade. Some, only made it through the sixth grade. These men migrated north to work at jobs in the auto industry, and, in fact, they found jobs there. These men were profoundly embarrased by the fact they could not read.  They in fact, taught me how to get around forms that they couldn&rsquo;t read.(It has come in handy). I taught these men to read. Some of these men learned very quickly, and well. For others, it was a long uphill battle. ALL of these men learned how to read. My math students were a different story. I do not know whether or not the older gentlemen could read an analog clock or not. These men did not gain literacy because of their circumstances. These men left their comfort zone in the south to make a better life for themselves. I enjoyed teaching them to read. My problem was with my math students.</p>

Because, it is pointless. I will say this: I tutored nine students in math. Six of those students learned how to tell time on an analog clock. They also learned the concept of clockwise and counter clockwise. These boys were fourteen years old on average. I&rsquo;m confident that they all went on to become rocket surgeons, because all they needed was a whole lot of one on one tutoring from an evil White.</p>

Read a few books about a typical day in the life of an American plantation slave. I mean that, seriously.  Read a few books that describe a typical day in the life of an American plantation slave. I have read those books, and I possess human empathy. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just make a flippant reply here to silence me. Do the research, friend.</p>
<p>Stating some simple realities about slavery it not a call to war. Slavery was brutal but my white Irish ancestors also endured brutal hardships. I am thoroughly pissed off at what is happening to whites in Western countries. The more people like me who wake up, the better it will be for whites and our children and grandchildren.</p>

Have to be sensational to sell.  Beside black slaves were precious and expensive commodities so it does not make sense to abuse them.  Since we will never know the true story, let&rsquo;s use former Rhodesia and South Africa as how blacks were employed.  They certainly lived better under white rule than now.</p>

<p>IF you believe that living as the West does is the best possible way to live, then yes, some benevolent form of colonialism would be best (and better than slavery). But - again, if you hold up Western living as the best in the world - the end benefits of slavery <em>to succeeding generations</em> (because really, we&rsquo;re talking about the benefits to black people alive TODAY, as their complaints about living with us are the catalyst for this discussion) trump living in more primitive dwellings with dirty water, scarce food, no real technology to speak of, endless tribal war and rampant disease with little medicine to combat it. </p>
<p>That all depends on my &#8220;if&#8221; above. If you think the most important thing is living in your motherland with your own peoples, cultures and languages, then any arguments about contact with Western culture are moot.</p>

I was going to make many of the same points about Dr. Steele that Mr. Taylor made. In the end, even the &#8220;conservative&#8221; blacks are not really our allies. In the end the issue of the lack of average black ability and the personality differences of blacks must be taken into account. Insisting on full equality is just wrong, as we are not equal. Whites didn&rsquo;t object when blacks took over basketball. We knew we were not equal in that area. So blacks must face up to the fact that there are some areas that they are not equal as well and let the chips fall where they may. Very good article, as usual. Conservatism is almost right, but not quite. Race realism is the right way to be.</p>

But in the long run, America was never so &#8220;racist&#8221; as to prevent Negroes (That&rsquo;s what they were called then.) from taking over a lot of these sports. In the end, their natural abilities won out. There was no need for &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; in basketball or football or boxing to get blacks in to these. So, we are so racist, but we don&rsquo;t mind letting black men beat up White men in a sport, but we are keeping blacks from doing well in science and engineering. Yeah, makes sense.</p>

Besides, in the context of the overall evolutionary of man, it was the norm and we are no longer there except perhaps in some parts of the third world.<br/>
But this country is moving beyond the Golden Era of the Negro as the Hispanic population increases and the white majority decreases.  Some blacks are seeing this and starting to protest why white tax dollars are going to illegals instead of them.</p>

<p>For example, when a white English-origin American writes a public letter to his Eurasian children, his comments about a third demographic being dangerous is not taken as legitimate messaging to kids who might need it, it was taken as a tribal supremacist attacking members of the black American tribe.  The blighted National Review fell for the tribal-based interpretation, make no mistake.</p>
<p>Unknown to most reader &amp; commenters here, when Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and African Americans look at the diverse white Americans, those groups&rsquo; members see a unified, monolithic, hateful, separate group dedicated to supremacy.  That is, they think we are a tribe, too, even if most of us work for the betterment of the whole nation.</p>
<p>This attitude, real or feigned, almost forces us to form up as a tribe and make demands for freedom from slander &amp; slurs, and freedom for our youth not to bleed out on the shores of the Black Sea or the Mediterranean Sea this summer in a war to benefit people half-way around the world.  A white American tribe would never sacrifice its youth for the ungrateful.</p>

<p>No, because of IQ differences and other inherent differences.  A thousand years from now, nobody will care about how many points DuBronn scored in a basketball game or how fast to the millisecond LeJustin ran a hundred meters in a straight line or the malodorous noise of people with stage names like 50 Cents our 3Pack or Lil Toilet.

Many Black people have complained in online comments that in their attempt to study hard to get a place in a good university, they are harassed by family and friends who say things like &#8220;why are you reading like the White man?&#8221;, until some eventually snapped and gave up. Maybe someone should tell Blacks that learning and innovation historically is NOT the exclusive domain of White people. If we can convince them that education is for their own good, we will probably start seeing more Blacks in engineering or medicine or business.</p>

Unfortunately, this is a genetic factor inherent in each race which no external factors can change.  This country spent trillions trying to prove otherwise (the nature vs nurture argument).

What they all seem to have in common is: 1) Disadvantaged Blacks or other minorities get signed up for an early education program, 2) They tend to show a noticeable improvement compared to control groups who did not attend head start, 3) After the end of head start, they tend to regress to their group mean.</p>
<p>What many people, including Jared Taylor, is to take this as an example of why head start is a failure. But what never seems to be explored is why do the children show improvement until they leave the program? I believe the program increases the children&rsquo;s interest in learning, but once they go home, the negative influence from Black culture pulls them back down. There&rsquo;s your problem! What we need to do is make Blacks shake off their anti-intellectual, promiscuous, self-pitying culture, THEN we will start seeing real improvement.</p>

If inherently they are capable, the improvement would continue without the artificial environment.  Look into Lincoln Elementary School in Chinatown Oakland, CA.  Those are turn key kids - no parents when they come home from school.  The parents do not speak English and are poorly educated but yet the kids excel.  Keep in mind, man creates culture and man is determined by his genes.  The environment can enhance superior genes but cannot turn inferior genes into superior ones.  This is the dilemma for the majority of blacks.  The global IQ of blacks is 70-75 which is mental retardation.  They can exist and survive but cannot go beyond that.</p>

What I said is culture and upbringing probably have more influence on outcome than genes. Northeast Asians tend to perform very well academically because our Confucian culture promotes learning, not because of our genes. For example, I&rsquo;ve read that on weekends and holidays, many Whites go to play football, go hanging out at the mall, or something along those lines. On the other hand, I usually stay at home to read a book or something. Likewise, Blacks fail probably because their culture discourages learning as &#8220;acting White&#8221;.</p>

What if the adopted children are still under pressure at school, at work, to act like other members of their race? What will happen if Black culture as it is currently, be given an outright ban? No Ebonics, no crime excused, no failure excused, no unjustified accusations of White racism tolerated, must work for your living, and so on. My guess is Black crime and illegitimacy will decline sharply, and Black education and income will rise.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-736574" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>That is a possibility. I imagine black kids adopted by whites who go to a school with a significant black student population probably are pressured to not &#8220;act white&#8221;. I&rsquo;m just not sure how much of an effect this is having once we control for genetics. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s much, but I can&rsquo;t prove it.</p>
<p>I suppose the ideal test for this would be to study black kids adopted into white families who have absolutely no contact with other blacks (except maybe &#8220;white-acting&#8221; blacks who support education and proper behavior). I can&rsquo;t think of any way we could study this without it being unethical, though, since it would require us to completely cut them off from ~12% of the national population (we couldn&rsquo;t even let them see ghetto-acting blacks on tv or read about them on the internet), so it probably won&rsquo;t ever be done.</p>
<p>I think a curtailing of black culture would be a positive thing even if it doesn&rsquo;t raise black IQs. If we were very serious about imprisoning black criminals and removing them from black neighborhoods (permanently, for the worst ones) those neighborhoods would get safer for black kids to live in and the culture might stop idolizing gangbangers, which <i>could</i> lead to fewer black kids wanting to be gangbangers in the future.</p>
<p>It would, at the very least, remove those criminal blacks from the gene pool, which would undoubtedly be good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to see ebonics be banned, both because it irritates whites to hear and because it harms blacks in the job market. Black kids who grow up learning to speak ebonics are being held back through no direct fault of their own from getting jobs as adults. We could (and should) be preventing this. I&rsquo;d like to see a lowering of the black unemployment rate and this would help it, though probably only marginally.</p>
<p>Illegitimacy would definitely drop if we stopped giving out welfare. The black illegitimacy rate has always been higher than the white illegitimacy rate, but it was <i>much</i> lower than it is now back before welfare existed and black mothers relied on their husbands to help support their children.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think any of this would raise their IQs, but it would probably be positive anyway. The only hesitation I have is that cutting off welfare to blacks will inevitably lead to an increase in black child starvation and I don&rsquo;t want to see children of any race starving in America, even if it is their parents&rsquo; fault for being irresponsible.</p>
<p>It would also lead to mass riots in any area with a significant black population, which would be very dangerous to any non-blacks unlucky enough to be there when it happens.</p>

<p>Not so, the variance in IQ scores is 80% heritable in adulthood. That being so there is little room for manoeuvre. The average black IQ in the US is 83.4 in adults. For whites, the average is 103 therefore if we can create an optimal environment for blacks then they could arguably increase their average to ca. 87, but in this optimal environment white and other average scores would probably improve also thus leaving a gap of at least 1.1 Standard deviations between whites and blacks: The situation would ostensibly be the same in relative terms albeit with possibly more conscientious and slightly more efficient blacks. There would still be a dearth of blacks in high cognitive professions. IQ is strongly predictive of academic outcomes and job capacity that&rsquo;s why it or its&rsquo; surrogates are used so extensively. </p>
<p>Moreover, in every country in the world blacks score at least 1 standard deviation below whites thus suggesting that US black culture is not the problem per se. As &#8221;Journey&#8221; says man creates culture and black cultures are the creation of the black man here and in Africa etc.</p>

<p>I think most of us do; certainly I&rsquo;ve seen it mentioned here frequently. There are obviously some people who deny this. (E.g. the claim made here that East Asian scores are cherry-picked is one I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of times.) I&rsquo;m sure they deny it for the same egotistical reasons blacks do. </p>
<p>The &#8220;why&#8221; would come down to both believing the IQ scores, and the fact that it&rsquo;s readily apparent. The difference between East Asia and Africa is readily apparent. The fact that any Western school with sizable percentages of minorities sees the same pattern of Asian kids in the AP classes, black/Hispanic kids in the remedial classes and whites spread throughout&hellip;is readily apparent.</p>
<p>I agree with you that black culture does black people no favours. I do think they could at least be doing a bit better than they are now - and I think that because they have done better in the past, under less liberal social policies that did not allow for such a degenerate culture. </p>
<p>But I think you are really pulling some blank slatism in this thread. Here&rsquo;s a question: WHY is East Asian culture so open to intellectual pursuit? WHY is anti-intellectualism so appealing to so many blacks?</p>
<p>Remember that culture does not exist in a vacuum. <em>People</em> create culture.</p>

<p>Moreover, the difference is not as yawning as that between Blacks and Whites and doesn&rsquo;t detract from White achievements and their ability to create and maintain advanced civilisations. Whites don&rsquo;t need to be propped up by Asians; Blacks need to be propped up by Whites as they are incapable on their own. Review negro history - their inability to create civilisation or invent anything worthwhile ever is startling. This is self evident. We are not equal and never have been. </p>
<p>Why the differences between North East Asians and Whites. Who knows? Different selection pressures and the luck of the draw in random mutations that arose perhaps. </p>
<p>I believe you are engaged in wishful thinking. The empirical evidence is in and only points in one direction vis a vis blacks no matter what metric you use. Moreover, the IQ gap has been virtually constant for 100 years despite numerous improvements in the black environment in the US. Many have tried to control for environment but the results are always the same.</p>

<p>As recently noted by Steve Sailer, on the 2008 SAT poor whites outperformed rich blacks.  More specifically, whites from family incomes of $20 – $40K outperformed blacks from family incomes of more than $200K.   Why are such privileged blacks scoring so low on the SAT?  The obvious answer, noted by many others, is genetics and the fact that these affluent blacks probably have their incomes as a result of affirmative action.</p>

What if you take all that away, and put the same demands on Blacks as Whites? Remember that Blacks used to have much lower crime and illegitimacy rates, and also used to do honest work, such as owning businesses. Whatever the ultimate outcome (even if they can never compete with Whites), its clear that affirmative action is what have done the most damage to Blacks.</p>

Though I love my race and would like to see them thrive, deep down I have always wished that we are all created about equal, and our ultimate fate depends mainly on our actions, not our genes. The idea that some people are literally born to fail, to suffer&hellip; that just seems so cruel and unfair to me. Many years ago, I read a book which I liked so much I took it to be the truth. I had made the contents of the book my personal philosophy until a few months ago, when a commentator on AmRen told me that the authors were Jewish, and most likely liberals. That was one big blow for me, and I went moping for a while. Here is an excerpt from that book:</p>
<p>Of Mice And Children<br/>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br/>
A stupefying experience shows that there are rarely any stupid pupils in class.</p>
<p>Teachers undeniably influence children directly by their personality, their attitudes, their relationship with the pupils, and the way in which they interpret the instructions. This influence may be exerted without their knowledge.</p>
<p>Robert Rosenthal, an American professor of psychology, once had the apparently preposterous idea of calling together 12 of his students, giving each of them 5 grey mice and giving them a few weeks to teach the mice to find their way through a maze. However, there was one important detail: he whispered to 6 of the students that their mice had been chosen for their particularly well developed sense of orientation, and told the other 6 students that, for genetic reasons, no great success could be expected from their mice.</p>
<p>In reality, these differences existed only in the minds of the students, since the 60 mice were identical in every aspect. When the training period was over, Robert Rosenthal found that the &#8220;overrated&#8221; mice had performed surprisingly well, while the &#8220;underestimated&#8221; ones had hardly moved from the starting point. Buoyed by this result, Rosenthal decided to try the same experiment in a training area of a different kind – a school. This was a strange adventure, the results which have been published (Pygmalion in the classroom, by Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobsen, Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston), causing great embarrassment to teachers.</p>
<p>In May of 1964, Rosenthal and his team arrived at an elementary school in South San Francisco, a poor area offering low wages, the home of many Mexican, Puerto Ricans and families on welfare. In short, an area in which it is generally recognized that the performance of children at school suffers as a consequence of the fact that they are &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; by the situation.</p>
<p>The intruders said that they were taking part in a &#8220;vast study&#8221; undertaken by Harvard, financed by the National Science Foundation, on &#8220;late developers&#8221;. Impressed by such grand-sounding credentials, the teachers opened wide the doors of their classrooms. The poor unfortunates were certain that they themselves, and not their pupils, were the subject of the investigation. The contribution required of them nevertheless appeared to be eminently &#8220;neutral&#8221;. They were merely asked to set, at the end of the school year, a &#8220;new kind&#8221; of test for the pupils in order to detect those who were capable of a spectacular sport during the subsequent school year.</p>
<p>In reality, this was all faked. The test – an IQ test – was merely a pretext; the &#8220;interesting&#8221; cases were chosen at random, 20% per class, and their names were given in a deliberately offhand manner to the teachers, like for example: &#8220;Anyway, in case you are interested in the results of the tests we carried out for Harvard!&#8221; Having thus conditioned the teachers without them realizing it, the research team merely had to wait and see what transpired. A further IQ test was given 4 months after the beginning of the new school year, another at the end of the year and the last one a year later. The results exceeded all expectations, leaving Rosenthal and his team gaping. The pupils who had been artificially selected as promising better results had progressed much more rapidly than the others!</p>
<p>To quote two examples from dozens: Jose, a Mexican child, had an IQ of 61 before he became a &#8220;star&#8221; in the eyes of his teachers. One year later, his IQ was 106. A &#8220;backward pupil&#8221; the year before, he had become, merely by a lottery, a &#8220;gifted&#8221; pupil. The same amazing change occurred in the case of Maria, another Mexican, whose IQ rose from 88 to 128. Asked to describe the behavior of these &#8220;interesting cases&#8221;, the teachers emphasized their &#8220;gaiety&#8221;, &#8220;curiosity&#8221;, &#8220;originality&#8221;, and &#8220;adaptability&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another revealing feature of the survey was the fate of the &#8220;run of the mill&#8221; pupils whose names were not whispered to the teachers; their results were far less brilliant. But even more serious is the fact that if one of the &#8220;run of the mills&#8221; did stand out from the rest he was automatically marked down by the teachers to the level at which he ought to have been. In other words, the more progress he made, the more he was inappropriately ranked. Since it was not expected, his performance was considered undesirable. It merely upset the teacher&rsquo;s forecasts.</p>
<p>The experiment thus proved that, as in the case of the mice, the educator&rsquo;s artificial prejudices have a decisive influence on the behavior of the pupil. It was an artificial designation alone that had transformed &#8220;stupid pupils&#8221; into brilliant students. In other words, good and bad pupils are creations of the teacher. In short, the essential prerequisite for the success of a pupil or a class is the teacher&rsquo;s belief in success. This would be the most economical reform of all. But also the most difficult to put into practice.</p>

But what I suspect is that Blacks have yet to reach their full potential (a.k.a. the Flynn Effect). For one, Black culture currently discourages learning; learning has been shown to have a positive effect on IQ scores. Second, Blacks currently live VERY unhealthy lifestyles, which impairs development, including mental development. Third, and most importantly, Blacks are currently under constant propaganda that they are oppressed and not responsible for their own failures. We can&rsquo;t know for sure until all these external factors are removed.</p>

Take a look at my reply to superlloyd above, which I asked whether s/he believes Northeast Asians are more intelligent than Whites, and why. I was hoping to get the standard reply of &#8220;if Northeast Asians are so smart, why have they invented relatively little compared to Whites?&#8221; (Which isn&rsquo;t exactly true, but for the sake of this argument, let&rsquo;s assume Northeast Asians are less inventive than Whites.) See what I mean? Isn&rsquo;t creativity an important aspect of intelligence? I notice that you guys like to bang on about the low IQ of Blacks and Hispanics as proof that these races are dumb, but you also tend to do an about turn when faced with the higher scores of Northeast Asians, trying to come up with various excuses to explain away this fact, one popular excuse being Northeast Asians have a narrower bell curve than Whites, which isn&rsquo;t true; based on SAT scores taken from Asia, Northeast Asians actually have a WIDER bell curve than Whites. About a week ago, in that article which pointed out that Northeast Asians have about 15% to 30% more Neanderthal DNA than Europeans, I noticed that many commentators said something like &#8220;Northeast Asians have higher IQ, but we have higher creativity, which we all know is more important&#8221;. If creativity is more important than IQ, than why are you still using IQ, other than to put down those who score lower than you?</p>

The Chinese have been known to cherry pick their test takers.  If the Asians were truly smarter, they would not be craving to come to Western countries to obtain a superior education, and the constant efforts to steal and copy Western inventions, and their societies would be equal or superior to whites.<br/>
The current economies and wealth of the advanced Asian countries like China, Japan, South Korea are due to the Western countries. We can throw India in there but it has a lot of work to do to curb its population growth, corruption, backwardness, etc, etc.</p>

Not all Northeast Asians steal and copy Western inventions; only China does, and that&rsquo;s because they had only recently began to recover from centuries of foreign invasion and internal corruption, and have a lot of catching up to do. Don&rsquo;t forget that many Eastern European nations also constantly steal other countries&rsquo; technologies. If fact, if you have been paying attention to recent inventions and discoveries, you will realize that Japanese and South Koreans have overtaken the West   &mdash;   despite having a fraction population compared to Whites (take a look at the number of patents granted to these two countries, they easily eclipse most Western countries).</p>

I have always believed that history should be a list of facts to be learned, not something to be rewritten just to make someone or something look good/bad; that is NOT history, that is nothing but propaganda (or some would call it pseudohistory). What I&rsquo;m just pointing out is that many Westerners are grossly ignorant of non-European achievements (other than gunpowder, which everyone knows is a Chinese invention). To be fair, this is understandable, as one of the first things a person learns is their own culture and its history, and later on, as one&rsquo;s knowledge increases, one might start learning about other cultures. I myself don&rsquo;t have much knowledge of non-Chinese inventors until I was around ten or so.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of my favorite quotes:<br/>
&#8220;It&rsquo;s time for an honest conversation between the East and West, of respect for each other and their contributions to civilization, and a mutual process of learning from each other and a building of a garland of wisdom with blossoms from both Eastern and Western gardens. Let the wearing of the blinds of ignorance be the specialty of someone else&#8221;.</p>

From there the carriers of superior civilization fanned out mainly to Greece and Europe by the way of what is now Russia.  At one time, Denmark was their capital.  The Chinese were in contact with this superior Middle East place of civilization.  They referenced it as the Goddess of the West.  So, yes, in the ancient past, knowledge did have cross fertilization.  The Tarim mummies found in the Xinjiang, China were of these people.  They up stepped the Northern Chinese when they interbreed with them.  There are paintings of these people with yellow hair and green eyes by the ancient Chinese.  So, again it goes back to the quality of the genes.</p>
<p>I did read your referenced article.  Most of the inventions are credited to Western minds.  In any case, it is the white brain power that has significantly pulled this planet forward.  It will continue to do so as long as their gene pool retains its integrity which the media currently is trying it hardest to undermine by encouraging breeding with blacks.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-737176" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yeah, but the referenced article also mentioned a significant amount of non-European inventions. I was hoping that the article will make you realize that you are actually not knowledgeable when it comes to non-European inventions. Many people here seem to belief that the majority of everything, if not everything, originated in the West, which isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why so many Western inventions have a name credited to it, but many non-Western inventions only mention the place of origin? The reason is probably due to Western individuality, which drives a desire to name AN inventor of.. well, everything. However, try digging a little deeper, and you will realize this simply isn&rsquo;t true. For example, Issac Newton did not came up with calculus and the theory of gravity by himself, he just improved upon the earlier works of ancient Indian scientists. Charles Darwin codified the theory of evolution, but he did not came up with the idea by himself; ancient Greek (namely Aristotle) and Chinese scientists understood the concept of evolution to some extent thousands of years before Darwin was born. And yet, many books today only credit Newton for the invention of calculus and the discovery of gravity, and only Darwin with the discovery of evolution.</p>
<p>How is this fair? The modern world was not created by single individuals, but by the contributions of many individuals of many different races over a long period. Therefore, I believe books should credit numerous people for most inventions and discoveries, which were never the achievements of single individuals in the first place. I&rsquo;ve once read about an American military instructor who was frustrated at the inability of his recruits to eschew individualism and instead work together, blaming this mentality on Western culture, which propagates the &#8220;dangerous belief&#8221; (actual quote) that single individuals, with enough courage and determination, can overcome any resistance and achieve remarkable success (e.g. Rambo, John McClane, Spiderman, etc). The instructor handed the recruit a handgun with a single bullet and told him that this was a better way to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Oh, and I did knew about the possible Middle Eastern admixture in North Chinese populations. Many people from North China, including myself, seem to lack certain features which are common in South Chinese populations. It is also said that Southern Han Chinese tend to score lower on IQ tests than Northern Han Chinese.</p>

Yes, Whites are currently the ones who achieved the most, but the groundwork which made this possible was built up over thousands of years, by people of many races. Many cultures have been number one at some time in the past, the West is just currently the bearer of the honor. Even Adolf Hitler, arguable the father of White supremacy, and who was well aware of the greatness of ancient Greece and Rome (Hitler and Mussolini often stated that the regard their countries as modern day equivalents of ancient Greece and Rome, and also adopted many Greco-Roman traditions, such as the Fasces), stated that he never regarded the Chinese as inferior to Europeans, and that he admitted that they have a history which is &#8220;superior to our own&#8221; (actual quote).</p>
<p>I suggest you read some books on ancient Chinese and Indian inventions, and trust me, you&rsquo;ll be SHOCKED at how absurdly advanced these two nations once were when compared to other ancient civilizations (including ancient Europe). For example, the Indus Valley Civilization (modern day Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan) had a very advanced sewage system (which was better than some modern-day Indian cities) the complexity of which would not be matched until ancient Roman times about a thousand years later. The Hindus also developed highly advanced procedures such as artificial limbs, cataract surgery, ear surgery, and so on.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-737201" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Since you ask, I will briefly tell.  Man first appeared almost 1 million years ago.  The first evolutionary humans from primates were the Eskimos during the ice age.  This was so to push man to be inventive in order to survive.  About 500,000 years ago, the six colored races appeared in accordance to the rainbow in the highland of India to one couple.  They were blue, yellow, and red –<br/>
the primary races possessing higher genetic material.  The secondary races were green, orange, and indigo (black) – secondary races possessing lower genetic materials.  The surviving races today are the red, yellow and black.  The black race primarily<br/>
migrated to Africa from India because of the less demanding environment.  In that environment they steadily regressed until later taken as slaves. </p>
<p>The cradle of civilization is due to extra-terrestrial beings (Adam and Eve) carriers of the highest genetic material.  They are called biological up lifters appearing on this planet some 38,000 years ago.  Their purpose was to uplift the evolutionary races to speed up evolutionary development – materially and mentally.  The present whites are primarily a mix of the blue race and Adam and Eve descendants.  This explains their brain power. There are much more to the history of this planet.</p>
<p>And the Tarim mummies found in the Xinjiang are Adam and Eve descendants as well as the ancient Greeks, etc.</p>

Please remember that many White Nationalists are biased against non-Western cultures. Also, some of the figures listed by Murray were actually frauds, like for example, Albert Einstein. At that time, much of the work on the theory of relativity had been already done by German scientists, and it was only a matter of time before someone else figures it out. In fact, Einstein didn&rsquo;t even contribute much himself; much of the contributions attributed to him were actually done by his non-Jewish Serbian wife, which is why Einstein agreed to share any money from his Nobel Prize with her beforehand.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to us all: the Nobel Prize is a politically charged award. A big reason why Ashkenazi Jews are so drastically over represented in the Prizes is due to the significant Ashkenazi population in Sweden, who lobbies for their race. Now, I do not deny that the Ashkenazim are a high ability race, but not all of their recipients were deserving. There are many scientists and inventors who were never given recognition because they were poor and did not have the clout to gain recognition. Compare all the fuss surrounding Einstein with the relative obscurity of Nicholas Tesla, a non-Jewish Serbian inventor. Our modern world most likely cannot function without alternating current, but can do just fine without the theory of relativity. Don&rsquo;t forget that Barack Obama was given a Nobel Peace Prize for basically sitting around and doing nothing, and Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, two mass murderers, were candidates for a Peace Prize, while Mahatma Ghandi was not even considered for a Prize.</p>
<p>The moral here is (and I include two of my favorite quotes):<br/>
1) Everyone knows that knowledge is power, but its reverse principle &#8220;power is knowledge&#8221; have been equally influential, if less well known&#8221;.<br/>
2) History is written by the victors.</p>

<p>As for the Nobel prizes, I hold no truck with that sham. Nevertheless, Murray&rsquo;s book paints, imo, a pretty clear picture of human accomplishment over time.</p>
<p>You will have difficulty convincing me that Whites are not the prime movers of civilization on this planet, not the sole movers, but the prime movers.</p>

People who would rather belief what they prefer to be the truth, rather than open themselves to other possibilities. In my point of view, such close-minded people are no better than the very liberals whom we often criticize for their tendency to shut out any realities that do not fit into their preconceived beliefs. I understand that few people are truly intellectually honest, but I try to keep an open mind. That means my beliefs are up for challenge, and are not set in stone. As I like to say &#8220;if something is real, then it wouldn&rsquo;t be a belief, it would be a fact&#8221;. A good scientist or historian is one who always strive for the truth, and whose only care is in the quality of their data, not whether it fits theirs or anyone else&rsquo;s likings.</p>

<p>I think I am fairly well versed in other cultures having spent many years living outside of the US. I certainly don&rsquo;t claim expert knowledge of Indian or Chinese culture, but freely acknowledge their contributions to civilization. For example, I know that the Chinese were making paper well before Western culture although the ancient Egyptians (Whites) were using papyrus too. I am also aware that the Chinese were expert sailors and traveled far and wide in huge sailing ships, etc. They were knowledgeable in steel production, iirc, before Europeans. I&rsquo;ve also read Indian religious texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, and studied Chinese religions.</p>
<p> Both China and India had rich ancient cultures and both have contributed greatly to world civilization. I have great admiration for both cultures. In modern times, India has produced several mathematical geniuses. </p>
<p>My support of my people is in no way an attempt to denigrate other civilized peoples. My support stems from a knowledge that Whites are a small minority in the world, and are in danger of disappearing as a distinct race even though we have greatly increased the sum total of knowledge.</p>

I understand the problems you Whites are currently facing, and yes, I do feel sorry for you. Oh, by the way, the ancient Egyptian probably weren&rsquo;t White, but Semitic. According to ancient Greek sources, as well as many ancient Egyptian paintings, the ancient Egyptians were described as curly haired, dark skinned people. Before someone says &#8220;Aha! The ancient Egyptians must be Black!&#8221;, the paintings also clearly differentiate between Egyptians and sub-Saharan Africans. Also, papyrus and paper are two different things, try reading that up.</p>
<p>I was just pointing out that any country which currently have the wealth and other necessary means to do research will produce the most inventions. Note that Japanese and South Koreans have for at least the last ten years produce on a per capita basis more innovations than Whites. Does this means Japanese and Koreans are &#8220;better&#8221; than Whites? No, I don&rsquo;t really believe that. I believe Whites and Northeast Asians are about equal. I&rsquo;m just pointing out that its so easy to kick at a race (in this case the Chinese) when they&rsquo;re down. Imagine, if in, say, 50 years, the West has collapsed due to mass immigration while China has fully recovered from its centuries of disastrous decline, and is again a world leader in science and technology. How would you feel if the Chinese start claiming they must be superior because they are then the ones who have invented the most?</p>

The Indians as well favored lighter skin; the Brahmins, the highest class, were probably caucasians; even today in India,  the lighter the skin, the higher the caste, generally.</p>
<p>While I fully understand the difference between papyrus and &#8220;paper&#8221; and the technology used to make each, they both preclude using stone, metal, and animal skins to apply writing; that was my point.</p>

Pale skin was regarded as a sign of class because it meant you don&rsquo;t spend all day working under the sun. Similarly, White cultures also used to hold pale skin in high regard (you may have heard of the term &#8220;fair lady&#8221;), until the beach culture of the 20th century. You may have read about Tudor girls in medieval England using a rather unhealthy concoction of lead and vinegar to keep their skin pale.</p>
<p>Also, here&rsquo;s a comment taken from the &#8220;A Brown Woman With A White Man Brings Out The Worst In Indians&#8221; article:</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>&#8220;I am an Indian and have been posting here under the anonymous tag every now and then for several years till date. So let me add my own two cents here.</p>
<p>It is a misconception that north Indians who are fairer have a higher IQ than south Indians who have more Dravidian features. The North Indians who are fair and tall (such as the Sikhs) are of Punjabi stock and are not exactly known for their intellect (with very few exceptions). They have Scythian ancestry in them, and Scythians were more of a brutal warrior race.</p>
<p>In India, the brightest are the Brahmins of South India (Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada), Bengal and Maharashtra (on the west and east coasts respectively). They, as a general rule, are shorter, darker and have facial features that are more Dravidian than those of Punjabi stock.</p>
<p>Just have a look at pictures of famed mathematician Ramanujan and astrophysicist Chandrasekhar (both Tamilians), you will know what I am talking about. Even the contemporary leading physicists such as Ashtekar (who is considered the father of Loop Quantum Gravity) or Chemistry Nobelist Venkatraman Ramakrishnan (Tamilian again) look far from the Iranian Caucasian types.&#8221;</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-737560" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Don&rsquo;t worry. I have seen many people who just LOVE to cherry pick data which fits into their beliefs, and discard the rest. I try not to become one of those bigots. That&rsquo;s why I learned a few methods to try to always keep myself calm (such as emptying my mind and taking deep breaths for a few seconds) so I can make a rational, unbiased judgement on every topic. Of course, I know that this isn&rsquo;t foolproof, as everyone is biased to some extent. Someone who is clear headed on one topic might shut up their mind on another.</p>
<p>The have read the book, and I was judging it with what I believe is the analytic method in use by scientists and historians. I read the book, compare it to what I know, and try to shift between the data to find out what is the truth. If enough evidence builds up against what I thought I knew, then I change my beliefs. Science and history is very complicated, and is constantly changing. Something which is held as fact now may be debunked as myth years later (for example, do you know that our brains aren&rsquo;t neatly segregated into a logical left brain and holistic right brain?). That&rsquo;s why a new edition of a science/history textbook has to be published every few years.</p>
<p>The problem is, I&rsquo;m just one person. In the distant past, maybe all the knowledge known to mankind can be held by a single person, but in this day and age, with the vast amount of knowledge humanity has accumulated, it is simply impossible for a single person to hold all that knowledge. That&rsquo;s why we now have highly specialized jobs (botanist, geneticist, marine biologist etc). I&rsquo;ve read many books on the history of China, Europe, India, and the Middle East. Problem is, most of those books were read long ago, and with all the other stuff I have read since, not to mention the things I have to learn at school, means I simply have forgotten most of it. For instance, I remember very little about the Etruscans, other than that they were ancient Europeans who predated the Greeks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why individualism, as in trying to go at it yourself, simply does not work. I tend to laugh whenever I saw in a movie a character who is said to be an expert in many fields. Do these filmmakers know how much time and effort it takes to become an expert in ONE field? People who major in many subject nowadays tend to end up as a jack-of-all-trades rather than an expert. Furthermore, I have learned from my years of reading that being an intellectual is simply tough, with all that thinking and trying to separate that many data to try to decide what is most likely the truth, gives you a headache sometimes.</p>
<p>No wonder intellectuals are held in such high regard throughout history. If anyone can do this, it would be considered normal and would likely receive no special attention. Hence, I guess I&rsquo;ll need to brush up on my knowledge of world history before I can make a sound judgement on Murray&rsquo;s book. As of right now, that book seems to be biased, but then again, I&rsquo;m not a historian.</p>

<p> I also consider that the scores <i>might</i> be a little inflated, and hispanic scores are definitely deflated. </p>
<p>A better measure might be g, rather than IQ.</p>
<p>The claim of less creativity is a shot in the dark, probably not true. </p>
<p>But in our personal lives, Asians seem much less- well- creative. They do the same activities, extracurriculars, and have few hobbies or passions.  They do not have much intellectual curiosity, though you are an exception, I guess. My Asian acquaintances in college (there were many of them), for example, spoke like middle schoolers, were not witty at all, were slow on the uptake (though not all), and had very little general knowledge (also supposedly correlated with intelligence). If I didn&rsquo;t know how much they studied and the grades they achieved, sometimes by cheating, I would think they would be in the dumbest quartile of the university. It turns out Asians at my university often underachieved based on SAT score, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Whatever the difference is between the races, it is darned obvious that something makes Asians better at learning/school. This can not be debated.</p>
<p>People on Amren overestimate white IQ because they forget that there really are A LOT of really <b>dumb</b> white people.,. We are too used to being around educated people!</p>

Thankfully, the China Chinese at least, seems to be catching on that this is an unhealthy way to raise children. My parents never grounded me or forced me to study, play piano, or do some other activity non-stop against my will. Instead, since as long as I can remember, they encouraged me to read by saying its good for me, it&rsquo;ll expand my horizons. They also arranged for family time where we will read some books together. Thanks to this relaxed upbringing, I never really felt stressed out at school, and I regularly read books on many topics. And guess what? I actually outperform many of my peers, who cram for the tests and who got stressed out because they view reading as work, not a leisure activity. Many of them got burnt out, couldn&rsquo;t perform well, and had to cheat to pass. I, on the other hand, haven&rsquo;t cheated since I was seven. True, unlike many of them, I don&rsquo;t exercise much and don&rsquo;t take part in any extracurricular activities, but unlike them, I&rsquo;m quite happy with my life right now.</p>

You should do what you are interested in, if that is reading, then good. I was commenting on the seeming lack of <i>interest</i> Asians as a group seem to have in&hellip; I dunno&hellip;anything?  </p>
<p>I could tell that you are different, though&hellip; because you are on this website, hahaha.</p>
<p>The issue of parenting (nature vs. nurture) is a constant debate in America. Unfortunately, there is an element of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Argument for nature:</p>
<p> 1) Many white parents have had no luck in controlling their children, no matter what they try. The kids just refuse to follow. 2) The HBD crowd does not believe parenting is important, based on some arguments from statistics. You can look into it at Jayman&rsquo;s blog, and follow links from there. 3) Tiger moms failed to control two particular Chinese boys I knew, despite putting them in the same social situations and schools as the rest of the Asians in the city 4) Indians and Jews (in the past) are supposed to be hard-driving, but their kids in America act just like white people. The &#8220;whiteness&#8221; of Indians is staggering. But they might not be as hard-driving [in the same way] as East Asians. 5) Hospital workers have found that East Asian babies differ greatly in emotionality, and this has been found in a certain study. You can flip and even plug the nose of an Asian baby, and he/she will not whine. The baby will go along with it. White babies will cry. Black babies are notoriously loud. Japanese babies are between Whites and Chinese. I think this is very important. 6) The great variety of behaviors and capacities among whites, even among siblings, forces whites to really believe in nature more than nurture. </p>
<p>Argument for nurture:</p>
<p>1) In regards to academic achievement, it is obvious that peers are super important. 2) Being in school <i>all day long</i> in Asia is going to affect the way you do school, and the way you do life. This does not apply to Asian-Americans. 3) There is the claim that beliefs influence emotions and behavior. So Asians might have vastly different beliefs about the world and about life, which affect the way Asians act. This is the wildcard that can negate some of the arguments for nature. 4) I personally believe that tests can be gamed because I did it. <img src="../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/> I am really not that smart, but I nearly got a perfect score on the GRE, a 168/170. The 170 verbal score is particularly absurd. I promise, I am nothing special in intelligence.</p>
<p>So there you go. I <i>think</i> I remembered everything that I think is important. I hope you had fun reading my crazy comment!</p>

My guess is these overworked children are too burnt out to think about anything except when their exhausting work schedule will end so they can go and rest/play. No wonder Northeast Asians are said to have the lowest self esteem and the highest rate of suicide.</p>

<p>IQ is a map, g is the terrain. Some maps are better than others in one respect, less accurate in others. Maps are not the only way to understand a space, either. Many animals and some humans have homing instincts that allow them to understand a terrain without anything like a &#8216;mental map&rsquo;. Likewise, IQ. If you are aware enough, you can talk to someone at length and get a pretty fine sense of their g without resorting to metrics or any other abstraction.</p>

<p>I suspect he extent to which people respond to euthenics is heteroskedastic, that the marginal improvement in a person&rsquo;s realization of their potential  due to a good environment is variable, probably with some dependance on their potential. </p>
<p>In other words, if someone is genetically disposed to have a low g, the effect of environment on their g outcome (as a THING, not measured) won&rsquo;t be that great. But for someone who is genetically disposed to have a higher g potential, their realized g might be much more sensitive to changes in environment. </p>
<p>If you know a man like John Stuart Mill, with his precocious and rigorous education, you might write a book like Emile and you would not be wrong in the observations you have made about men like John Stuart Mill. But these observations mean nothing about men who are NOT like John Stuart Mill</p>

<p>I know how you feel. I also initially found that very hard to believe. But if they are not less intelligent, then there MUST be a very robust alternative explanation - because it has to explain a lot. The ugly state of much of Africa. The huge, intractable achievement gaps between whites and blacks in the West. The inability of blacks (as a group) to qualify for many employment positions without lowering standards. The higher tendency of blacks to make poor and impulsive decisions, resulting in higher crime rates, higher obesity rates, higher STI rates, high rate of single motherhood&hellip;and so on and so forth. </p>
<p>(&#8220;Stupid&#8221; here is relative, of course. If the average black IQ is actually 85, that&rsquo;s still just within the &#8220;normal&#8221; range. Blacks are supposed to have a narrower curve than we do, so the ones below 85 are mostly not THAT much farther below.  College-going IQ is generally about 115; in America, about a million blacks would fall on or above that cutoff. So knowing black doctors is nowhere near impossible.)</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe that they have a lower mean IQ, and you don&rsquo;t believe in white racism as the root of all black ills&hellip;then what other answer is there? That&rsquo;s a serious question. We&rsquo;re searching for a racial &#8220;theory of everything,&#8221; so it has to be good.</p>

<p>Perhaps high achieving blacks can take a leadership role in this, and provide inspiration for their people&hellip; Bill Cosby used to try to do that (until it became obvious that he was a creepy and criminal serial rapist)</p>
<p>There are no quick and easy answers here. I can&rsquo;t fix the problems plaguing blacks. All I can do it strongly reject the ivory-tower academic memes of white privilege that suggest the terrible problems facing blacks are the fault of white people. I tend to think that white folks need to start circling the wagons because with white births dropping rapidly, we are going to have to start standing up for our interests.</p>

So, let&rsquo;s present another angle, nothing was given to whites to accomplish their intellectual achievements.  Whites created industries, cities, innovation, invention, etc. from what is in front of them.  Why did not the blacks in their own country of origin, Africa?</p>
<p>Answer:  the quality of the genes.  Man is inherently limit by the genes that created him.  The environment can challenge man to be inventive but it cannot change the inherent from inferior to superior.  And inter racial breeding with the inferior always comes at the expense of the superior that is the superior genes get suppressed and diluted.  Past ancient advanced civilizations have fallen due to miscegenation.  The ancient Aryans knew of this and installed the caste to prevent it but to no avail.</p>

Remember that during World War II, Slavs were regarded by the Nazis as inferior to West Europeans because they had yet to show their potential.</p>

<p>It is not just black families who discourage education. I knew a man from a poor white family who was the first person in his family to enter university and not only did his family members not support or encourage him, they seemed to take it as a person insult that he was raising himself above them (by going to university). It was very sad. </p>

<p>If you were to live around blacks, you would see&hellip;. the stuff they do defies all sense. I saw some blacks trying to wash their car in the parking lot of their doctor&rsquo;s office today. They are beyond just poor; they are nuts. It is nonstop crazyness. Pureblooded blacks are, on average, batshit weird as mess. Look up &#8220;The Rent is Too Damn High&#8221; for an example of what I mean.</p>
<p>Mexicans have higher dropout rates, and worse opinions about school, but I do not see such idiocy in Mexicans. Mexicans actually seem quite capable to me, as they learn many mechanical skills for fun, but hey, my city&rsquo;s police force put the hammer down on MS-13, so I do not see the bad side. Of course, as you know, many blacks in America are not fully black, which helps with the IQ stuff. And I guess the Mexicans are not fully Amerindian, though some of them look like it.</p>

If, in a marriage that has been broken by some misdeed, one side refuses to reconcile, there can be no reconciliation. Liberals and Blacks have for too long labeled both Whites and America herself as &#8220;evil,&#8221; for having simply evolved over time, as all societies do. Was slavery right? No. But is America, and America alone, to be eternally punished for the evil of slavery when slavery has existed on every continent, to one extent or the other, and been practiced by almost every race, since the beginning of history? Is America alone to pay an eternal price to a &#8220;victim&#8221; that can never be restored, because the victim refuses to be restored? </p>
<p>I say no. We have tried, mightily, and instead of healing the wounds, they have become greater. Instead of teaching a man to fish, we have created millions to whom we find ourselves giving more and more fish, but their hunger is never assuaged. Now, we are at the point that our very society must soon collapse, and in many respects, it is because we created a vast welfare state to try to make reparations for sin&hellip;reparations which those who demand them will never accept as complete. And in the process, we have denied our own heritage, our own accomplishments, and the pride that should accompany those who created the most advanced civilization in recorded history. </p>
<p>As I said, I have come, after 60 years, to agree with you. America, as a Constitutional Republic, is dying as I write&hellip;it is enough, no more should be paid. Let Blacks have their land, and Whites theirs&hellip;and others as can be agreed&hellip;Let us all take pride in our accomplishments, repent of our errors, do the best to improve the lot of our own, live in peace, and trade with one another in goods; but let us live separately. And should others then try to take what is ours, let them be met with destruction. </p>
<p>And let us never, ever, make the mistake of attempting a multiracial, muti-cultural society again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because blacks lag significantly behind whites on measures of cognitive ability, most valid job selection criteria will have a substantial adverse impact on this group. The combination of well-documented racial differences in cognitive ability and the consistent link between ability and job performance generates a pattern that experts term &#8216;the validity-diversity tradeoff': job selection devices that best predict future job performance generate the smallest number of minority hires in a broad range of positions. &#8221; </p>

They may in part be power seeking but in essence they are ego preserving. They explain the gross discrepancies between populations when the real explanation,  that black people just suck at being white people, is taboo. It&rsquo;s taboo for them because it is a threat to their ego to know that they are inferior (at being white-but they live in a white world, after all) and it is taboo for us because we are empathic.</p>
<p>White hating is getting more aggressive because  the more &#8216;progress&rsquo; our society makes to egalitize while discrepancies remain, the greater the need for an explanation. It&rsquo;s a negative feedback loop based on an error. If we fix the error we should be OK.  Collectively accepting that we are different subspecies would fix the error. How that happens will be messy.</p>

Slavery had ended in other western countries without war, and would have ended in the US without war if there&rsquo;d been competent leadership. (The industrial revolution had already begun to make slavery obsolete.) The war was not fought for any moral purpose. Even Lincoln didn&rsquo;t care about freeing slaves.

<p>Lincoln did not run on a campaign to promise to free the slaves. His goal was to keep slavery out of the free states, and out of the territories. Many who voted for Lincoln voted for him because they wanted to keep slavery out of those areas because they wanted to keep blacks out of those areas.  </p>
<p>There was little support for abolition in the North. If cooler heads had prevailed in the South there would have been no secession and no Civil War.</p>

It wouldn&rsquo;t because there are racial differences that prevent blacks from succeeding in these fields at the same rate as whites. Surely, Dr. Steele must realize that if blacks were as talented in engineering as they are in basketball, not even race preferences and a victim identity would have held them back. It may be that blacks are discouraged to some degree by the fear the Left drums into them that nasty white people are waiting at every turn to trip them up, but blacks with real talent and drive can succeed in any field.</p>
<p>- Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, March 19, 2015</p>
<p>Jason Taylor&rsquo;s candid acknowledgment of innate racial differences is refreshing. It is also as startling as the little boy who shouts, &#8220;The Emperor has no clothes!&#8221; Everyone has noticed it, but everyone thinks it is virtuous to lie about it.</p>
<p>Liberals and conservatives blame whites at the other end of the political spectrum for black problems. Liberals blame systematic racism and white skin privilege. Conservatives blame &#8220;the Democrat plantation,&#8221; implying that if the welfare system came to an end blacks would be able to become prosperous middle class citizens.</p>

<p>While a majority (55%) of whites support affirmative action programs on campus, that compares with 84% of blacks who believe they are a good thing and 80% of Hispanics. Nearly eight-in-ten (78%) Democrats back the programs as a good thing, as do 62% of independents; Republicans are mixed, with 50% seeing the racial preferences as a bad thing and 43% viewing them as a good thing.</p>

<p>This also appears on Pew Research:</p>
<p>In the most recent Pew Research Center values survey, released May 21, [2009] just 31% agreed that &ldquo;we should make every effort to improve the position of blacks and minorities, even if it means giving them preferential treatment.&rdquo; More than twice as many (65%) disagreed with this statement. That balance of opinion has fluctuated only modestly through the 22-year history of the values survey.</p>
<p>The values survey revealed continuing racial differences in attitudes about this issue. Majorities of both African Americans (58%) and Hispanics (53%) favor preferential treatment to improve the position of blacks and other minorities; just 22% of whites agree.</p>

Whites enslaved blacks in America a few hundred years ago. Blacks have stolen jobs and college admissions from white quite recently. Since there is no white person alive who was complicit in slavery I do not see how it is relevant. But if a white person were to claim the right to slay any black for the crime of Affirmative Action I would not know how to refute him.</p>

So TrueNorthFree was talking about different races. Different breeds of dogs are commonly referred to as different races. I think the confusion here is because popular culture tends to wrongly use &#8220;race&#8221; to refer to a species. Hence, I think the proper term should be &#8220;the human species&#8221;, not &#8220;the human race&#8221;.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-737104" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>For almost 150 years the United States has been conducting an interesting experiment. The subjects of the experiment: black people and working-class whites.</p>
<p>The hypothesis to be tested: Can a people taken from the jungles of Africa and forced into slavery be fully integrated as citizens in a majority white population?</p>
<p>The whites were descendants of Europeans who had created a majestic civilization. The former slaves had been tribal peoples with no written language and virtually no intellectual achievements. Acting on a policy that was not fair to either group, the government released newly freed black people into a white society that saw them as inferiors. America has struggled with racial discord ever since.</p>
<p>Decade after decade the problems persisted but the experimenters never gave up. They insisted that if they could find the right formula the experiment would work, and concocted program after program to get the result they wanted. They created the Freedman&rsquo;s Bureau, passed civil rights laws, tried to build the Great Society, declared War on Poverty, ordered race preferences, built housing projects, and tried midnight basketball.</p>
<p>Their new laws intruded into people&rsquo;s lives in ways that would have been otherwise unthinkable. They called in National Guard troops to enforce school integration. They outlawed freedom of association. Over the protests of parents, they put white children on buses and sent them to black schools and vice versa. They tried with money, special programs, relaxed standards, and endless handwringing to close the &ldquo;achievement gap.&rdquo; To keep white backlash in check they began punishing public and even private statements on race. They hung up Orwellian public banners that commanded whites to &ldquo;Celebrate Diversity!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Say No to Racism.&rdquo; Nothing was off limits if it might salvage the experiment.</p>
<p>Some thought that what W.E.B. Du Bois called the Talented Tenth would lead the way for black people. A group of elite, educated blacks would knock down doors of opportunity and show the world what blacks were capable of. There is a Talented Tenth. They are the black Americans who have become entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors and scientists. But ten percent is not enough. For the experiment to work, the ten percent has to be followed by a critical mass of people who can hold middle-class jobs and promote social stability. That is what is missing.</p>
<p>Through the years, too many black people continue to show an inability to function and prosper in a culture unsuited to them. Detroit is bankrupt, the south side of Chicago is a war zone, and the vast majority of black cities all over America are beset by degeneracy and violence. And blacks never take responsibility for their failures. Instead, they lash out in anger and resentment.</p>
<p>Across the generations and across the country, as we have seen in Detroit, Watts, Newark, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, and now Ferguson, rioting and looting are just one racial incident away. The white elite would tell us that this doesn&rsquo;t mean the experiment has failed. We just have to try harder. We need more money, more time, more understanding, more programs, and more opportunities.</p>
<p>But nothing changes no matter how much money is spent, no matter how many laws are passed, no matter how many black geniuses are portrayed on TV, and no matter who is president. Some argue it&rsquo;s a problem of &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; as if culture creates people&rsquo;s behavior instead of the other way around. Others blame &ldquo;white privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But since 1965, when the elites opened America&rsquo;s doors to the Third World, immigrants from Asia and India–people who are not white, not rich, and not &ldquo;connected&rdquo;–have quietly succeeded. While the children of these people are winning spelling bees and getting top scores on the SAT, black &ldquo;youths&rdquo; are committing half the country&rsquo;s violent crime–crime, which includes viciously punching random white people on the street for the thrill of it that has nothing to do with poverty.</p>
<p>The experiment has failed. Not because of culture, or white privilege, or racism. The fundamental problem is that white people and black people are different. They differ intellectually and temperamentally. These differences result in permanent social incompatibility.</p>
<p>Our rulers don&rsquo;t seem to understand just how tired their white subjects are with this experiment. They don&rsquo;t understand that white people aren&rsquo;t out to get black people; they are just exhausted with them. They are exhausted by the social pathologies, the violence, the endless complaints, and the blind racial solidarity, the bottomless pit of grievances, the excuses, and the reflexive animosity.</p>
<p>The elites explain everything with &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; and refuse to believe that white frustration could soon reach the boiling point.,.,</p>

<p>Also, he is the product of a black man having sex with a white woman and he too has sex with a white woman. His example is miscegenist, and to endorse him is to endorse the black sexual conquest of the white race since the great majority of black/white sexual unions are black male and white female.</p>

It is mechanistic. It also has the pitfall of the practicioner engaging with the problem as defined, once defined, rather than a fluid engagement with reality. So you only reevaluate the model when you have exhausted all of the paths in a decision making tree and nothing worked, rather than, you know, just paying attention. An approach I and others associate with Robert McNamara, perhaps unfairly. A great approach in engineering, but not so good in other arenas. I could go on. (I probably should, as you are such a careful conversation partner.)</p>

<p>Look at Manhattan/Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Hollywood, Las Vegas, Seattle, Atlanta, Boston, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and etc. </p>
<p>How come rich Liberals use gentrification(spearheaded by neo-aristocratic homos) to create posh white spaces in big cities? </p>
<p>Liberalism is just about making a lot a noise about &#8216;equality&rsquo; to hide the fact that affluent Liberal whites, Jews, and homos are creating exclusive spaces for themselves.</p>

<p>A truly guilty person will quietly atone for his sins. </p>
<p>So, if a white liberal is truly guilt-ridden, he will give away all his wealth to non-whites. He will offer his job to a non-white and enter a monastery and pray forgiveness. </p>
<p>But notice that white Liberals love to make a big fuss about &#8216;white guilt&rsquo;.<br/>
They love to show it off as a badge of decency and pride. &#8220;I love myself because I hate my people.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then, Christians mastered this over the many centuries. Christians would say, &#8220;Dear Lord, I&rsquo;m a sinner and so unworthy&hellip;. therefore, I&rsquo;m so wonderfully repentant, and that gives me the moral right to judge others and call them heathens and burn them at the stake.&#8221;</p>

Three publications are worth consulting: Oswald Mosley&rsquo;s prophetic &#8220;British Peace &amp; How to Get It&#8221;; the first volume of David Irving&rsquo;s &#8220;Churchill&rsquo;s War&#8221;; and Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s &#8220;Churchill, Hitler &amp; the Unnecessary War&#8221;.  &#8220;The Holocaust&#8221; - which was much more than, and different from, a &#8220;good old-fashioned Catholic Inquisition&#8221; -  might have been averted if a peace agreement had been made in 1939 and plans for a Jewish national territory put in place. During the past century western Europeans could and should have co-operated in the development of their then underpopulated &#8220;kitchen garden&#8221; of Africa.</p>
<p>But that is blood under the bridge. What is needed now is close co-operation between people of European descent in the rescue and restoration of our unique civilization.</p>

<p>I call it &#8216;America Under Glass&rsquo;.</p>
<p>My inspiration is the City of Calgary in Canada. I was in Calgary on my way to hunt dinosaur fossils nearby. That was in the summer. Calgary has a whole city within a city. I&rsquo;m told Edmonton - which is even further north - has an even more dramatic city within a city.</p>
<p>In these bitterly cold cities the public can still walk about and live normally because large areas of the city are under glass domes. It&rsquo;s like a mall except bigger and more extensive. In Calgary they have big public water slides where the Canadians can defy the weather.</p>
<p>These towns are sort of like Science Fiction cities on Mars or the Moon.</p>
<p>We could do the same thing in America beginning with some malls by simply restricting them to white and Asian people. All across America malls are failing because of black teens who rob and attack white patrons. White people in many parts of the country are afraid to go outside because of the prospect of meeting marauding blacks.</p>
<p>But a white only mall is vary likely to prosper spontaneously. There would be the large area that was free of the most likely criminal elements. People would get in their cars and drive to the mall. It wouldn&rsquo;t matter how bad the surrounding neighborhood was. They would be safe at home and safe once they got to the mall.</p>
<p>This is the sort of solution that could resurrect Detroit. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine any other solution that stands a chance. Soon of course the safe mall areas would begin to merge and whole areas would become safe.</p>
<p>Obviously this sort of residential and commercial segregation will run into legal challenges. It won&rsquo;t be easy to overcome the objections. But consider this: this idea is non-violent. America is running out of non-violent solutions. America needs solutions that do not involve incarceration or concentration camps.</p>
<p>I will write about this more.</p>

<p>I appreciate your faith in humanity&rsquo;s ability to resolve this peacefully, but it seems to me that we are way past the point where some kind of Apartheid could be imposed without major bloodshed. Total segregation with extreme border control may be the only way.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-739023" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Obviously my proposal is a form of segregation. But it has several advantages. First of all it does not require any big initiating effort. Just establish one mall somewhere as white only. It should prosper.<br/>
White people are the ones who create prosperity. A white only mall will have an immediate competitive advantage over old fashion mixed population malls. So other investors would tend to invest in the white only malls.<br/>
As a mall prospers and white people feel safe in going there the number of attractions should grow. Theaters, book stores, libraries, museums and dance clubs. You can think of more.<br/>
A simple commercial mall with standard mall shops would soon attract smaller shops that would give the mall a neighborhood like feel. For example instead of simple mall food courts after a while there would be side walk cafes and gourmet restaurants.<br/>
After all where are the downtown high end restaurants going to go as the center of our cities rot out from the blacks?<br/>
A dividing point comes when a mall reaches the nearest cross street. The bigger malls will jump the streets with overpasses. The public will still not need to go outside.<br/>
These glass enclaves I am imagining will not be high security bunkers of concrete. The blacks will want to get in, of course, but it&rsquo;s easy to guard against break ins. If blacks mass for an incursion that would be a contingency that the police would be able to handle. If you break int a white only glass covered enclave the penalty might be a few years in prison.<br/>
Notice that no business would need to be compelled to do anything. If you wanted a mixed race work force - so be it. But businesses that wanted a white only workforce would have a way of placing their place of business where blacks wouldn&rsquo;t go. There would be no need for Apartheid like rules.<br/>
These white only glassed over areas would be in cities only. The countryside would be open to everyone - at least at first. This is a proposal with no taxes, and no compulsion. Private businesses could opt-in for a white only strategy. They need only attach to an existing glass enclave. It would be a business decision.<br/>
There would be disputes of course and many of them would be violent. Blacks would soon realize that all the wealth was being tied up in the white enclaves. They would revolt undoubtedly. But the alternative is race war.<br/>
We are not ready for this proposal yet. But if things get worse - as I believe they might - this is the peaceful way out.<br/>

1. Race is biological construct. It is the root of a society, which cannot be changed by laws, systems, policies, etc.<br/>
2. An individual&rsquo;s ability can vary, but we can&rsquo;t deny that there is a average performance of each racial group and gaps of average performance between groups always exist. The more population of a race, the more accurate the distribution.<br/>
3. A nation&rsquo;s future lies in its people&rsquo;s hands as the same as a race&rsquo;s future. Internal factors are way more important than external factors. A race who cannot evolve and adapt is doomed to die out.<br/>
4. The sense of guilt of their own race seems only to be found exclusively on white people, almost impossible to find on other racial groups. The guilt (a negative emotion) only attracts bad consequences according to laws of attraction. Only positive mindset of your identity leads you to a healthy and balanced life.</p>

With rare exceptions, the average White or American of North Asian ancestry has nothing in common with the inner city Black and the latter seems to represent the majority of the Black population. It&rsquo;s fruitless to try to find solutions to closing the divide.  They will NEVER change . Perhaps the divide needs to be widened.<br/>
The Blacks need to have an Epiphany that is not likely to happen. Looking at today&rsquo;s African nations, the same violence and primitive customs are evident.<br/>
The only solution may be a division of the US into separate nations.</p>

The key truth and key problem preventing Blacks from &#8220;integrating&#8221; into White society is their cognitive inferiority. Tons of Blacks have been handed White collar positions that accomplish effectively the task of dumping them into the deep end of the pool intellectually. They are dumped into this metaphoric deep end as marginal swimmers or even non-swimmers, surrounded by Whites who are proverbial olympic swimmers. When the stark reality of the inferiority is front and center, the trusty life preserver they reach for is none other than those trusty old accusations of racism. White co-workers point out a job poorly done at their own risk, with those trusty old accusations of racism used by Blacks in defense every time. Incompetence is rife and blatant wherever Blacks do anything other than waxing floors and cleaning toilets these days. It is obvious, blatant, shameful. Speak the truth about this to the wrong person or in the wrong place, though, and you are treated as a criminal. Unless, of course, you are non-Caucasian, like Mr. Steele. A Mulatto who grew up with nothing but economic privilege, such as Obama or Steele, is allowed to foment pure hate against Whites without no resulting admonishment, yet if you are full blooded Caucasian and come to this country from the ecomonically deprived hinterlands of Yugoslavia or Ukraine, you are treated like a criminal for even pointing out the obvious truth in a non-hateful fashion. </p>

So that for one makes it hard to take totally seriously. For two, almost all this talk about race comes from academia. People on the street just follow the examples set by their schools, universities, media, social workers and other highly educated people who come from a small circle of American life. </p>
<p>Of course academia has long complicated theories and ideologies about race. The average person on the street is just trying to make the next pay check and enjoy life. Most don&rsquo;t care about race. Some do. Most working class whites are tired of not getting the same benefits as everyone else (job training, welfare etc.) or having their neighborhood go downhill due to certain racial others. Maybe tired of affirmative action. The average black person tired of being profiled by cops or store owners and feels his life sucks and just needs somewhere to direct the rage (that&rsquo;s where the liberal elite come in and point them at something to hate- whitey). </p>
<p>And that so called black person looks like a dark skinned jew to me.</p>

<p>My point about asians is, there is such a thing as too many.  There are billions of them and we&rsquo;re importing almost a million every year.  That&rsquo;s just way too many and especially considering they will be having asian families of their own here and their asian children&rsquo;s children and then America will be Asia.</p>

<p>Races arise in all biological species that cover a wide geographical area. For example there are the &#8216;Low land&rsquo; Gorilla and the &#8216;Mountain&rsquo; Gorilla. Among our closest relatives the chimpanzees there are I think four races. And of course the Bonobos are also very similar to chimps. Bonobos and chimps only exist as separate species because they can&rsquo;t swim. The Congo river keeps them separate.</p>
<p>Similarly whites live in Europe and the Middle East. Blacks lived in Africa. In a state of nature these races were always divided  - so there isn&rsquo;t anything new to explain.</p>
<p>If you ask the question - &#8220;Why the divide?&rsquo; that means that you tacitly assume that the races should be united. It may have been true in the early twentieth century that the races were largely interchangeable. But the modern world today favors whites and East Asians because the modern world favors higher IQs. The job market today requires a High School Diploma and blacks are much less able to earn one than are members of the more advanced races.   </p>
<p>The world is moving away from blacks and other equatorial peoples.</p>

No, the Nazis did not regard the Slavs as a formidable opponent (at least not at first). Right before the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Hitler famously stated &#8220;we only need to kick in the door, and the whole rotting edifice would come tumbling down&#8221;. The Nazis expected a quick victory, and for a while, it appeared they were right. They managed for push back the Soviets with little losses up until Stalingrad. By then, Soviet war machine production had finally managed to catch up. From then on wards, the Soviets managed to gradually push back the Germans, all the way back to Berlin.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-742446" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;There is an ideology that fundamentally traces all existing institutions back to power politics. And this ideology corrupts humanity and also destroys the Church. Here is a very concrete example: If I see the Church only under the aspect of power, then it follows that everyone who doesn&rsquo;t hold an office is ipso facto oppressed. And then the question of, for example, women&rsquo;s ordination, as an issue of power, becomes imperative, for everyone has to be able to have power. I think that this ideology, which suspects that everywhere and always what&rsquo;s at stake is basically power, destroys the feeling of solidarity not only in the Church but also in human life as such. It also produces a totally false point of view, as if power in the Church were an ultimate goal. As if power were the only category for explaining the world and the communion present in it. After all, we are not in the Church to exercise power as if we were in some kind of association. If belonging to the Church has any meaning at all, then the meaning can only be that it gives us eternal life, hence, real life, true life as such. Everything else is secondary. If that isn&rsquo;t true, then all &#8220;power&#8221; in the Church - which then sinks to the level of a mere association - is nothing more than an absurd &#8220;spectacle&#8221;. I think we have to escape from this theology of power and this reduction that derives from Marxist suspicion.&#8221; Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, 1996.</p>
<p>This applies as much to race relations.  The leftist notion that &#8220;everything is political&#8221; means that everything is about power, and therefore any relationship where power dynamics are unequal is ipso facto oppressive - no matter how mutually beneficial it may be to both parties.  It follows, then, why the Left doesn&rsquo;t believe in meritocracy.</p>

Blacks are owed nothing know because that debt was paid off a long time ago. They choose to stay rather than start a new life and prove they could make but they made their bed and now they have lie in it. Whites owe blacks nothing. White also fought to end the slave trade so if anything the Blacks owe whites a debt for ending the Trans=Atlantic slave trade while the sahara slave trade still went on. Worse thing we did was bring them to this country even if it was the elite rich who did it and forced everyone else to deal with their problem.</p>

<p>1. One-way ticket to the African nation of their choosing;<br/>
2. $5,000 cash;<br/>
3. Both conditional on renunciation of US citizenship</p>
<p>So many problems would be solved with this plan. How would we pay for it? Who cares? Surely, the cost would be less than dealing with the overabundance of black criminality and their cradle-to-grave dependance on government &#8220;assistance&#8221; in the time it would take to pay it off.</p>
<p>Some quick napkin math shows<br/>
roughly 38,000,000 negroes in the US;<br/>
Times $5,000 each;<br/>
Equals $190 Billion USD </p>
<p>Cheapo Air (dot) com says that a one-way ticket to Monrovia, Liberia (departing JFK in NY on May 31 2015) can be had for under $900 each. Surely our government could get a better deal buying them en masse, but still - adding that to our previous numbers</p>
<p>38,000,000 negroes<br/>
$5,900 each<br/>
$224.2 Billion</p>
<p>All that is based on the optimistic assumption that we could get them all - every last one of them - to leave. Probably quite a few would stay. Figure a full third. Maybe more. </p>
<p>Still: A quarter of a trillion dollars, and we could wash our hands of the whole mess. A one hundred fifty year old nightmare could finally come to an end. For 1.3% of a single year&rsquo;s GDP, it could all be over. Heck, I&rsquo;d be willing to pay an extra White Reclamation tax for a period of time to accelerate the process.</p>
<p>We need to surreptitiously push this idea. Make them think it&rsquo;s their own.</p>

In yet another slap at whites who had absolutely nothing to do with slavery, reparations will become a reality unfortunately. Will the descendants of those lost in the Civil War Union cause be recompensed by blacks? Can I ask a more ridiculous self evident question?</p>

<p>1. He is barely &#8220;black&#8221;, he is an octoroon.<br/>
2. Whites in fact do not set the course of discussion in this country.<br/>
3. Whites were not the &#8220;oppressor&#8221; of blacks, but rather the liberator of blacks.<br/>
4. White exclusion of blacks in the past was not a &#8220;sin&#8221;, it was an intelligent and practical policy for sociopolitical stability.</p>
<p>Non-Whites need to drop their Entitlement Complex which makes them falsely believe that they can take from Whites whatever they want.</p>
