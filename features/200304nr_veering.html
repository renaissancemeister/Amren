			<h1>
				<i>National Review:</i> Veering further into irrelevance
			</h1>
			<p>
				<span class="dropcap">I</span>n the April 7, 2003, issue of <i>National Review</i>, editor David Frum wrote a lengthy article called &ldquo;Unpatriotic Americans,&rdquo; which smeared many by name and was an example of the sort of thing now increasingly common in what many once considered the flagship of American conservatism.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Frum tried to discredit all &ldquo;Unpatriotic Conservatives,&rdquo; by which he MAINLY meant those who opposed the war in Iraq: <a href="https://www.buchanan.org/">Pat Buchanan</a>, Robert Novak, <a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/">Llewellyn Rockwell</a>, Samuel Francis, Thomas Fleming, Scott McConnell, <a href="https://www.antiwar.com/">Justin Raimondo</a>, <a href="https://www.sobran.com/">Joe Sobran</a>, Charley Reese, Jude Wanniski, Eric Margolis, Kevin MacDonald, <a href="https://www.takimag.com/">Taki Theodoracopulos</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/">Chronicles</a>, the <a href="https://www.amconmag.com/">American Conservative</a>, <a href="https://www.vdare.com/">Vdare</a>, the late M.E. Bradford, Paul Gottfried, the <a href="https://www.theoccidentalquarterly.com/">Occidental Quarterly</a>, the Council of Conservative Citizens, and the Citizen&rsquo;s Informer. Mr. Frum also called <i>American Renaissance</i> &ldquo;white supremacist.&rdquo; We sent a letter to <i>National Review</i> (see below), which it failed to print.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Frum&rsquo;s list of enemies of the people seems to us to be more than just about the war with Iraq. It is also an attempt to silence the debate on race.
			</p>
			<p>
				As James Lubinskas has very clearly documented, <i>National Review</i> once understood there is an ethno-cultural core to all nations and civilizations, including those of the West. Even as recently as the 1990s, under John O&rsquo;Sullivan, NR gave favorable reviews to books like <i>The Bell Curve,</i> and. J. Phillipe Rushton&rsquo;s <i>Race, Evolution and Behavior.</i> Peter Brimelow and Ed Rubenstein explored the dire consequences of Third-World immigration, and Mr. Brimelow contributed a favorable review of <i>Paved With Good Intentions</i>. Articles by Sam Francis and Jared Taylor even appeared in <i>National Review</i> during the 1990s &mdash; only a decade ago in time but a century ago in relevance and backbone.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are sorry to see <i>National Review</i> veer even further not only into irrelevance but also the most shrill and unbecoming invective. However, its once-loyal readers can still find work that follows the principles NR once proudly proclaimed &mdash; written by men NR now wishes to &ldquo;exile.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Our letter, which NR refused to print:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					In his April 7 article, &ldquo;Unpatriotic Americans,&rdquo; Mr. Frum refers to <i>American Renaissance</i>, which I edit, as &ldquo;white supremacist.&rdquo; If he had ever read the magazine, of which 10 years&rsquo; worth of back issues are available at www.amren.com, he would not have made this silly mistake. It is true that we have published some of the overwhelming evidence in support of the view that biological differences between the races account for differences between blacks and whites in average IQ and crime rates. However, the same evidence strongly suggests that biological reasons account for north Asian superiority to whites in these same respects.
				</p>
				<p>
					American Renaissance also takes the view &mdash; entirely obvious to anyone not blinded by liberal orthodoxy &mdash; that most people prefer the company of people of their own race, and that forced integration is an unacceptable violation of the freedom of association. These views, once defended vigorously by National Review itself, would be more properly known as racial realism rather than supremacy.
				</p>
