<h1 class="title">White Renegade of the Year-2013</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Gregory Hood, American Renaissance, December 31, 2013</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
Who did the most damage when he could have done the most good?</div> 
</div> 



<p><i>Today we inaugurate what we expect to be an annual series. At the end of each year we will profile a white person who could have been a champion for his people, but instead joined the fight against us. The White Renegade of the Year can be someone like this year&rsquo;s award-winner, who attracted and mobilized supporters only to turn on them, or he can be someone who has never shown the slightest sign of racial awareness but who has been especially diligent in working against his own people. </i></p>
<p><i>There are so many good candidates that we could make a white renegade award every month &mdash; heck, every day &mdash; but this year&rsquo;s inaugural honors go to the junior senator from Kentucky, Rand Paul.</i></p>
<p><b>What Might Have Been</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;For of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: &lsquo;It might have been!&rsquo; &rdquo; So we may say of Rand Paul.</p>
<p>Much <a href="../../../features/2012/01/ron-paul-and-race.html">like his father Ron</a>, the younger Paul was initially a favorite of white advocates, running as a populist, anti-Establishment candidate who strongly opposed illegal immigration. His platform on border security included the construction of an electric border fence &mdash; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/24/rand-pauls-underground-el_n_624535.html">underground</a>. When he beat the odds to enter the Senate, it was as if Tom Tancredo had somehow reached the upper chamber &mdash; indeed, Congressman Tancredo endorsed Rand Paul in his Senate run and his Team America PAC <a href="http://us-campaign-committees.findthedata.org/l/6792/Team-America-Pac">donated</a> money to him.</p>
<p>Rand Paul had a national following and dedicated activists throughout the country. He could push his father&rsquo;s movement closer to the conservative base and mobilize it behind <a href="https://vdare.com/articles/lew-rockwell-and-the-strange-death-or-at-least-suspended-animation-of-paleolibertarianism">the paleolibertarian tradition</a> of defending America&rsquo;s borders and cultural identity. If Rand Paul worked to reduce immigration, slashed the multicultural state, and promoted real freedom of association we might actually have someone to vote <i>for. </i>More importantly, we could have someone who could build a real movement: the anti-state, anti-multiculturalist Right heralded by <a href="../../../features/2013/10/libertarians-and-race-realism.html">race-realist libertarians such as Murray Rothbard</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike his father, Rand Paul had extraordinary appeal to grassroots conservatives as an embodiment of the implicitly white Tea Party movement. Not for nothing was his book (ghost written by <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2013/07/the-fall-of-the-southern-avenger/">Jack Hunter</a>) called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Tea-Party-Goes-Washington/dp/1455503118/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388264934&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+tea+party+goes+to+washington"><i>The Tea Party Goes to Washington</i></a>. While Ron Paul caused rage and frustration among many mainstream conservatives because of his views on foreign policy and his willingness to break with the Republican Party, Rand Paul was hailed as a conquering hero even by the likes of Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh. Rand Paul had it in him not just to be the leader of a faction, but of the entire American Right.</p>
<p>White advocates are always tempted to hail anyone controversial as a potential hero &mdash; a variant of what the Catholics call the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_of_contradiction">sign of contradiction</a>.&rdquo; The progressive media <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/paranoia-strikes-deep-the-press-and-rand-paul/277009/">treated</a> Rand Paul&rsquo;s entry into the Senate with only slightly less hysteria than if he had been David Duke. Headlines shrieked about Rand Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;racist staffers&rdquo; in the same way they wailed and gnashed their teeth over Ron Paul&rsquo;s <a href="/">supposedly offensive newsletters</a>.</p>
<p>Conor Friedersdorf, <a href="https://vdare.com/articles/conor-friedersdorf-conservatism-inc-and-kiddie-cons-who-won-t-read-say-or-think-anything-un">who makes a living</a> being a subservient &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; conservative shadowboxing with liberals, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/paranoia-strikes-deep-the-press-and-rand-paul/277009/">wrote</a> that &ldquo;In the political press, it happens again and again: libertarian leaning folks are portrayed as if they&rsquo;re radical, extremist ideologues, even when they&rsquo;re expressing ideas that are widely held by Americans across the political spectrum.&rdquo; Perhaps the ultimate blessing came from our friends at the Southern Poverty Law Center, who <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2011/spring/electoral-extremism-23-candidates-on-radical-right">named</a> Rand Paul one of the leading &ldquo;electoral extremists&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Radical Right.&rdquo; Naturally, white advocates assume that anyone whom the media hate must be doing something worthwhile.</p>
<p>But being hated by the right people isn&rsquo;t the same as being right. In retrospect, we should have seen it coming. After winning the primary, Rand Paul got into trouble on the <i>Rachel Maddow Show</i> for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/20/rand-paul-tells-maddow-th_n_582872.html">expressing</a> the standard libertarian argument against the Civil Rights Act of 1964<i>, </i>saying, &ldquo;Does the owner of the restaurant own his restaurant? Or does the government own his restaurant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Rand Paul was running in the conservative stronghold of Kentucky, he could not muster the <a href="https://vdare.com/articles/duck-dynasty-on-verge-of-victory-for-historic-america-if-they-dont-quail">same courage as someone in <i>Duck Dynasty</i></a><i>. </i>He <a href="https://vdare.com/articles/memo-to-rand-paul-on-the-civil-rights-act-the-issue-is-not-segregation-its-anti-white-quota">quickly backtracked</a> and assured everyone of his enthusiastic support for the act, and, presumably, the unlimited right of the government to tell business owners whom they can and cannot serve or hire . When he reached the floor of the Senate, he made sure to use his first speech to <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/258716/rand-pauls-maiden-speech-question-compromise-andrew-stiles">condemn</a> the great Kentucky statesman Henry Clay for compromising with slavery, and compared himself to abolitionists. Even chinless Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell walked off the Senate floor in disgust.<i> </i></p>
<p>Cruelly, there was a moment of hope. Rand Paul kept his campaign promise in 2011 by <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/vitter-rand-paul-propose-amendment-to-pare-back-birthright-citizenship">co-sponsoring</a> an attempt to end birthright citizenship. At the time, Senator Paul said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Citizenship is a privilege, and only those who respect our immigration laws should be allowed to enjoy its benefits. This legislation makes it necessary that everyone follows the rules, and goes through same process to become a US citizen.</p></blockquote>
<p>With statements like that, we wanted to believe &mdash; oh so desperately! &mdash; that the media were right, and that a dangerous populist who actually meant what he said was in the United States Senate.</p>
<p><b>Support of amnesty</b></p>
<p>Alas, it was not to be. Just after the 2012 elections, Rand Paul <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83737.html">announced</a> that he now <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/goodbye-rand-paul">supported</a> an &ldquo;eventual path&rdquo; to citizenship for illegals, albeit one that <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/hold-on-a-minute-is-rand-paul-alaso-advocatingan-immigration-moratorium">suggested a moratorium on legal immigration</a> in the meantime. However, this did not indicate that Senator Paul was thinking outside the box on immigration; it suggested he was not thinking at all. In some speeches, Senator Paul was confused about the <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:l9yQ1Q3uom0J:www.vdare.com/letters/a-reader-alerts-us-to-rand-pauls-awful+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">difference between green cards and citizenship</a>, and his &ldquo;evolving&rdquo; views on immigration reflected the chaos that results when a politician takes a new position but hasn&rsquo;t yet figured out what it is or how to explain it.</p>
<p>By 2013, the explanation was forthcoming. Senator Paul had identified what was standing in the way of conservative victory: the conservative base. This past year, we saw a series of initiatives, speeches, and publicity campaigns on a host of topics. All of them could be seen as variations on the theme that whites can be replaced.</p>
<p>The opening salvo came in February, when Rand Paul gave the &ldquo;Tea Party&rdquo; response to the State of the Union address. He had been chosen as the designated representative of the overwhelmingly white conservative grassroots, as the champion of the populist insurgency who would communicate the authentic feelings of the man in the street, instead of the &ldquo;official&rdquo; Republican response given by professional Latino and amnesty booster Senator Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Rand Paul took the opportunity to give a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/02/12/rand-paul-obama-sotu-tea-party/1913795/">speech</a> that sounded just like Marco Rubio:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are the party that embraces hard work and ingenuity, therefore we must be the party that embraces the immigrant who wants to come to America for a better future. We must be the party who sees immigrants as assets, not liabilities. We must be the party that says, &#8216;If you want to work, if you want to become an American, we welcome you.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, if all it means to be an American is that &ldquo;you want to work,&rdquo; nearly everyone on earth is a potential American. Far from being a break with the Republican past, Rand Paul was taking the GOP back to the days of George W. Bush.</p>
<p>The Kentucky senator didn&rsquo;t stop there. The next month, Mr. Paul&rsquo;s pilgrimage took him past the standard neoconservative concept of a &ldquo;proposition nation&rdquo; to embrace racial solidarity &mdash; for non-whites. On March 19, he addressed the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, beginning his address in Spanish and endorsing the idea of a bilingual nation, arguing that &ldquo;Republicans who criticize the use of two languages make a great mistake.&rdquo; He spouted the usual clichés about how we need hard-working Latino immigrants to fill jobs, even though Kentucky already had an unemployment rate higher than the <a href="http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000">national average</a>. Senator Paul then patronized his audience with a quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Neruda#Communism">Pablo Neruda</a>, a Chilean writer &mdash; and well known Communist Party member who wrote odes to Joseph Stalin and Fidel Castro.</p>
<p>Rand Paul&rsquo;s policy prescriptions could have come from the pen of Joe Biden. Senator Paul dismissed the idea of &ldquo;deporting 11 million people&rdquo; &mdash; completely ignoring self-deportation through enforcement. He bemoaned the current &ldquo;<i>de facto</i> amnesty&rdquo; without explaining how creating <i>de jure</i> amnesty will make things better. He recited the usual litany of praise for Hispanic superiority in &ldquo;family, faith, and conservative values&rdquo; &mdash; even though Hispanics are <a href="../../../archives/reports/hispanics-a-statistical-portrait.html">more likely than whites to have abortions</a> and <a href="../../../nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr62/nvsr62_01.pdf">illegitimate children</a>, less likely to own businesses, and are far more politically liberal.</p>
<p>But Senator Paul actually went beyond the standard liberal position. He specifically denounced E-Verify, an employment check to prevent illegals from getting jobs. Even Barack Obama and John McCain claim to support this commonsense measure. In the name of liberty, he declared his opposition to any plan that will force &ldquo;businesses to become policeman.&rdquo; (No doubt, he will soon campaign against employers policing the withholding of income taxes &mdash; also in the name of liberty.)</p>
<p><b>Outreach</b></p>
<p>Having bent the knee to <i>La Raza, </i>Rand Paul moved on to blacks, with a widely publicized address at Howard University on April 10. Here, he was greeted with laughter and scorn from the overwhelmingly black audience, as he acted <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/04/rand-paul-howard-university-outreach-republican-party">like he deserved credit simply for showing up</a>. Incredibly, Senator Paul flatly denied that he ever questioned the Civil Rights Act, even though, as one student pointed out, the evidence is &ldquo;on tape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand Paul began his address by telling the audience that he wasn&rsquo;t going to &ldquo;lecture&rdquo; them and then proceeded to do just that. Like Sarah Palin pretending that the socialist Martin Luther King was actually a proto-Tea Party activist, Mr. Paul recited Republican clichés that have nothing to do with today&rsquo;s reality. He told the audience that Lincoln was a Republican who freed the slaves, that the founders of the NAACP belonged to the GOP, and that the Democrats supported Jim Crow. Left unmentioned was the shift in black support from the Republicans to the Democrats, largely in opposition to the limited government conservatism Senator Paul claims to champion. He praised Howard alumnus Edward Brooke as a great black Republican, but couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to get his name right, calling him Edwin Brooks.</p>
<p>This moment in Republican outreach rivaled the time when Karl Rove <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxcuVlCuX9Y">danced like a rapper</a> at a correspondents&rsquo; dinner. It was simply another chapter in the long history of Republican groveling. After all, as Dave Weigel wryly <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/rand_paul_speaks_at_howard_university_the_libertarian_presidential_hopeful.html">noted</a>, &ldquo;the post-election Republican visit to Howard is practically a tradition.&rdquo; RNC chairman Ken Mehlman made the trip in 2005 to apologize for the Southern strategy of appealing to white conservatives in the formerly Democratic South. Affirmative-action RNC chairman Michael Steele made the same trip in 2009 as part of his vaunted outreach to blacks. Neither speech did anything but embarrass the GOP.</p>

<p>But Rand Paul declared victory and moved on. In December, he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/09/rand-paul-african-american_n_4409356.html">spoke at the new Republican African-American Outreach Office</a> based in Detroit. There, the senator promoted &ldquo;economic freedom zones&rdquo; that would bring prosperity and opportunity through low taxes in urban areas. Unfortunately, the audience was filled with &ldquo;well-dressed, white supporters.&rdquo; Most of the blacks present were outside, protesting with Al Sharpton&rsquo;s National Action Network. Rand Paul also paused in December to <a href="http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=1051">honor</a> Communist Party member and former South African President Nelson Mandela, speaking of &ldquo;the indelible mark he left on his country and the world [that] will serve as an example of rightness and perseverance for humanity for all time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>The Jack Hunter debacle</b></p>
<p>Ironically, even though Rand Paul repeatedly humiliated himself trying to prove he&rsquo;s not racist, he was caught in one of the largest political scandals of the year. His close aide, <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2013/07/the-fall-of-the-southern-avenger/">Jack Hunter</a>, who was once known as the &ldquo;Southern Avenger,&rdquo; was the subject of a <a href="http://freebeacon.com/rebel-yell/">hit piece</a> by the neoconservative <em>Washington Free Beacon</em>. Mr. Hunter had once said sensible things about race and multiculturalism, including, most damningly, that mass immigration would render American meaningless. He was also once a member of the League of the South, made critical comments about Abraham Lincoln, and used the Confederate flag as part of his pseudo-wrestler persona. All of this was dutifully reported in point-and-stutter style, and spread with staggering speed across both the conventional Left and Right.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunter immediately recanted from most of his positions in an interview with the <i>Beacon. </i>He wrote his former editor at the <i>Charleston City Paper</i> asking him to remove controversial articles, but this backfired spectacularly when the editor <a href="http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/HaireoftheDog/archives/2013/07/18/former-editor-of-rand-pauls-neo-confederate-staffer-talks-about-the-southern-avenger">condemned</a> him as a coward and a racist. Rand Paul claimed that he hadn&rsquo;t read all of his staffer&rsquo;s work, some of which he called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/11/rand-paul_n_3577196.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003">absolutely stupid</a>.&rdquo; Inevitably, Jack Hunter left Rand Paul&rsquo;s staff &mdash; in what Mr. Hunter called solely his decision and what Senator Paul called a &ldquo;<a href="http://freebeacon.com/rand-paul-claims-aides-exit-mutual-decision-despite-aides-contrary-statements/">mutual decision</a>.&rdquo; As a result, despite all the pandering Rand Paul did throughout the year, the black-oriented website TheGrio <a href="http://thegrio.com/2013/07/11/southern-avenger-scandal-puts-paul-family-racial-track-record-back-in-spotlight/">wrote</a>, &ldquo;As Kentucky Senator Rand Paul weighs the possibility of a 2016 presidential run, his past &mdash; and present &mdash; record on racism manages to catch up with him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hunter would later <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2013/12/waking-up-from-the-american-dreamthe-last-word-on-jack-hunter/#more-43952">cautiously re-emerge</a> with a humiliating article for <i>Politico</i> entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/confessions-of-right-wing-shock-jock-jack-hunter-100261.html">Confessions of a Right-Wing Shock Jock</a>.&rdquo;<i> </i>Mr. Hunter explicitly disavowed his former writings and claimed that his views had changed. However, not content with condemning himself, he condemned the entire conservative movement as complicit in his offensive past, suggesting that he only said these things to appeal to the larger American Right. Luckily, Mr. Hunter says, a new libertarianism that emphasizes tolerance, diversity, and sensitivity is changing the American Right. &ldquo;It certainly changed me,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>And now this new, fuzzy multicultural American Right has a champion running for the White House in 2016: Rand Paul.</p>
<p><b>The futility of it all</b></p>
<p>There is nothing new about any of this. The Republican Party is always trying to turn itself into something else. George W. Bush justified his run for the White House on the grounds that his &ldquo;compassionate conservatism&rdquo; represented a new era for the party and a break with the cold rhetoric of the past. He also said that he could win Hispanic voters &mdash; since he claimed to speak Spanish. Ken Mehlman, who is Jewish and later came out as homosexual, headed the Republican National Committee from 2005 to 2007 at a time when liberals bemoaned &ldquo;Christian theocracy.&rdquo; Mr. Mehlman spent much of his tenure apologizing for the conservative base and urging more outreach.</p>
<p>Michael Steele justified his time as head of the RNC on the grounds that he could make an impact on black voters, and that the GOP had previously been &ldquo;unconcerned about minorities.&rdquo; Senator John McCain, who has been one of the most vocal supporters of amnesty in the Republican Party, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-sen-john-mccain-sen-robert-menendez/story?id=18316360&amp;singlePage=true">argued</a> that the GOP should support comprehensive immigration reform because &ldquo;we are losing dramatically the Hispanic vote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, in the more distant past, there was Jack Kemp, a former NFL player who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/us/03kemp.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">claimed</a> that he was uniquely concerned about black voters because &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help but care about the rights of the people I used to shower with.&rdquo; Mr. Kemp&rsquo;s proposals for &ldquo;enterprise zones&rdquo; in depressed urban areas are practically identical to Senator Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;economic freedom zones.&rdquo; The record of the attempts of Ken Mehlman, Michael Steele, John McCain, and Jack Kemp to win over non-white voters speaks for itself. Rand Paul&rsquo;s stale rhetoric and patronizing outreach has been part of the failed Republican playbook for decades.</p>
<p><b>Who speaks for us?</b></p>
<p>Republican incompetence and failure is not the point. The point is that Rand Paul turned his back on his own constituents, who voted for him because he campaigned as a populist, anti-establishment candidate who would restrict immigration. Nor is Rand Paul simply adopting a socially moderate tone to be acceptable to the mainstream media. He is quite willing to take media criticism for aligning with the Religious Right. He has written a bill that would define life as starting with conception, and has been a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. He even <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/12/nation/la-na-nn-rand-paul-obama-gayer-20120512">joked</a> that he couldn&rsquo;t see how President Obama&rsquo;s position on marriage could get &ldquo;any gayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when it comes to anything that would advance white interests on immigration, racial preferences, or crime, Rank Paul dances to the media&rsquo;s tune. He has even <a href="http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=news&amp;id=855">claimed</a> the American justice system is biased against blacks.</p>
<p>This is what happens when ambition comes before what might once have been convictions. Rand Paul&rsquo;s father Ron was once explicit about the dangers posed by multiculturalism and mass immigration, <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2005/08/ron-paul/immigration-and-the-welfare-state/">writing</a> that &ldquo;we must address the cultural aspects of immigration&rdquo; and calling for a vigorous defense of the southern border. However, once he became a national figure and the tribune of the libertarians, he <a href="https://vdare.com/articles/worse-than-a-crime-a-blunder-ron-pauls-tragic-turnaround-on-immigration">reversed his position</a>.</p>
<p>Rand Paul is making the same transformation as he sets his sights above being the junior senator from Kentucky and positions himself as a contender for President. In order to appeal to corporate donors and ensure the support of the libertarians who comprise his national following, Senator Paul has made the strategic decision to abandon even implicitly white racial politics. Instead, he will run as a pure &ldquo;Constitutional conservative,&rdquo; mouthing platitudes about limited government while raking in donations from companies lusting for cheap labor. In the end, Rand Paul has become all but indistinguishable from Beltway Right hacks such as open-borders apologist Grover Norquist or corporate lobbyist Dick Armey.</p>
<p>In his journey from promise to pointlessness, Rand Paul occasionally talks like a Jacksonian nationalist, but his ideological core is by-the-numbers libertarianism. Not only does he not recognize whites as a group with collective interests, he doesn&rsquo;t recognize America as a nation with interests. Instead, America is simply a place where deracinated, rights-bearing individuals live and compete with each other about who gets to make the most money. Although for electoral purposes Senator Paul had to give the nod to immigration restriction, his ideological core is being played out before our eyes–open borders, cheap labor, and utter indifference to the demographic makeup of the country.</p>
<p>This may actually understate Rand Paul&rsquo;s uselessness. As shown in his nondefense of the principle of free association, whenever libertarianism conflicts with political correctness, Senator Paul bows to the latter. Though he said he would fire anyone proven to be a &ldquo;white supremacist,&rdquo; he has no problem speaking to racially collectivist groups of nonwhites. When there is pushback from the Left, Rand Paul retreats. The only targets libertarians feel free to attack are white conservatives.</p>
<p>Rand Paul, like the Beltway Right, sees cultural and racial trends as essentially fixed. Like weather patterns, they are beyond human control. Therefore, all Mr. Paul can do is try to carve out a niche for libertarianism in the areas permitted him by the media gatekeepers. Thus, he can talk about why libertarianism is good for blacks as a group, but not why it is good for whites. He can promote libertarian opposition to &ldquo;racist&rdquo; drug laws but not libertarian opposition to the forced-association consequences of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
<p>And this is the essential problem of Rand Paul. The libertarian takeover of the Republican Party is not a liberation from feckless and corrupt leaders. It&rsquo;s a takeover by people who are unwilling to show even symbolic solidarity with the white Republican base. The tragedy is that Rand Paul was ideally positioned to lead a real political insurrection, to turn the Tea Party into the Middle American Revolution prophesied by Sam Francis. He had a real opportunity to create a movement that could roll back the multicultural state, stop illegal immigration, and reverse anti-white discrimination. Instead, we have someone who is afraid to talk about limiting immigration but thinks it&rsquo;s a winning issue to <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37273085/ns/politics-decision_2010/">defend</a> British Petroleum after a catastrophic oil spill.</p>
<p>The worst of it is that Rand Paul is dependent on increasingly dispossessed whites. Angry white voters who understand that the financial, cultural, and political elites despise them are looking for a leader. Senator Paul struck a revolutionary pose but ultimately lead his followers into familiar dead ends. Worse, he takes promising activists and leaders and neuters them.</p>
<p>Instead of opposing a political class that enables mass immigration, the rise of Rand Paul and Beltway Libertarianism has given us a generation of enthusiastic and intelligent young activists fighting for the immigration and cultural policies of George Soros. It&rsquo;s worse than a safety valve; it&rsquo;s outright misdirection.</p>
<p>This is why Rand Paul wins our award as White Renegade of the Year. He has heaped far more scorn than he had to on his party, his people, and himself. Even when he doesn&rsquo;t need to, he defends the anti-white narrative of the media. Even when it would be to his advantage, he avoids fighting for the cause of his constituents, and clings to clichés or outright fabrications to avoid being called a racist. In so doing, he condemns his own cause to inevitable political defeat and his own people to demographic destruction.</p>

<p>We can take one note of grim satisfaction. No matter how many outreach centers he opens, how many aides he fires, how many embarrassing, groveling speeches he makes, Rand Paul will always need race-conscious whites.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we need him.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-409948" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for pointing out Jeff Sessions. He is not perfect, but probably the best we have. If Sessions kept up his tack on immigration control (he seems to be pushing for a moratorium on all immigration, legal and illegal), and adds to it a commitment to do whatever it takes to bring our international trade into balance (his record is mixed), and calls for undoing affirmative action policies as the cherry on top, then I think he could roll over the Human Pear (a/k/a Hillary!) and into the White House. Ah, a white in the White House, how sweet the sound.</p>

It pays to study and watch them on all the issues. Observe their dialogue and see how thy flounder from topic to topic. They walk a fine line between worrying about their public image as opposed to standing for what they believe in. The result is infuriating and disheartening to their fan base.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-409468" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The trite and way too simplistic way to summarize the career of William F. Buckley is that the CIA sent him in to wreck the right wing. </p>
<p>(That axiom suffers from an accuracy problem: Buckley&rsquo;s involvement with the CIA came after he founded NR.)</p>
<p>I think the more accurate way to put it is that WFB was the establishment&rsquo;s emissary to the right wing of American politics, in that his political activism was not in good faith. Basically WFB&rsquo;s goal in his professional life was to neuter the right so that it was not a threat to the establishment, even if they did happen to win the occasional election.</p>
<p>Before WFB and NR, the right was isolationist-protectionist north of the Mason-Dixon Line and segregationist-racialist south of it. WFB gladly let people from both camps into the NR orbit when he started it, but slowly and surely, one by one, picked them off. What we&rsquo;re left with today is &#8220;conservatism&#8221; that is entirely an abstraction at heart, but egalitarian-universalist all the way. </p>
<p>Ever wonder why the left wing today loves WFB so much, why they gush over his &#8220;integrity?&#8221; It&rsquo;s because he was a beautiful loser.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-409599" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Your theory about WFB merely drifting leftward over the decades is supported by the fact that in 2008, not long after he died, either his son or nephew endorsed Obama. The lamer cons were fit to be tied over that, but I think that if WFB would have lived, he would have done that. IOW, the son or nephew that endorsed Obama was merely taking over the leftward march of WFB himself.</p>

I remember two of NR&rsquo;s purges during my youth, first when they had a symposium (which I think they pompously released as a book) to intellectually tar and feather Pat Buchanan as an anti-semite and then soon after they did the same to Joe Sobran for the same reason. Presumably both were guilty of only being against the fabricated case for war against Iraq in 1991, which in turn produced the backlash promulgated by the Israeli lobby and the Military Industrial Complex. I soon dropped my subscription to NR not long after.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-408270" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There was a similar debate on Occidental Dissent. Rand Paul was one of the finalists, the others being Paul Ryan and Pope Francis.</p>
<p>I had to go with the Pope, mainly because there are perhaps a billion Catholics, all of whom as a matter of faith believe that Pope Francis is the Vicar of Christ, whereas Rand Paul Ryan, if they both run for President in 2016, will be splitting that big time 5% Republican constituency that voted for Jack Kemp in 1988.</p>

<p>2. That Mr. Hood didn&rsquo;t write anything about Rand Paul&rsquo;s most notable &#8220;accomplishment&#8221; of the year, his more than half a day long filibuster against a bill that was going to pass anyway to drone on about drones, is understandable, because it really had nothing to do about race per se. But the more time goes on, the more useless that filibuster seems. Not only is it useless, and probably publicity-seeking, it&rsquo;s counterproductive and disingenuous on top of that. For the only time that we have ever used armed drones against &#8220;American ctiizens&#8221; are in foreign countries against &#8220;citizens&#8221; with names like Mohammed al-Terroristiqua. Nobody except for a few whackjobs is actually proposing their use on regular domestic American territory. However, Rand Paul&rsquo;s droning about drones did nothing but unnecessarily confuse people on the issue. All the while, and at about the same time as the drone filibuster, he was running around, as Mr. Hood points out, to one Hispanic race lobby and Razatard group after another promising that &#8220;we&rsquo;ll find a place&#8221; for all their illegal alien squatter job thieves.</p>
<p>3. Rand Paul and Ron Paul are a lot more alike than even this article admits on race and immigration issues. Any notion that they aren&rsquo;t is purely a result of mendacity on the part of both of these individuals.</p>
<p>4. OT: Mr. Hood alludes to the BP gulf oil spill. One news story that ran way under the radar in the aftermath is that the whole thing may have been caused by the failure of some crucial mechanical part that was made in China.</p>

It&rsquo;s like those who knew and enabled homosexual pedophile Jerry Sandusky all those years.</p>
<p>These never ending, never winning Ron and Rand Paul presidential campaigns give Jamie Kelso and others in the cult something to do. There are meetings, debates, it gives a small group of White people something to do, some type of life.</p>
<p>Lot&rsquo;s of our people need to &#8220;get a life&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Whites who were with Ronald Reagan way back when Reagan was governor of California in the 1960s, they wouldn&rsquo;t disavow Reagan when he was old and senile in his second Presidential term.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think it can generate a sense of bond and commonality. Granted individuality and economic freedom are great things and, I would posit, character traits of our people, but&hellip;</p>
<p>The ideology has been no more successful in correctly identifying the root problem than any other acceptable modern ideology. </p>
<p>I mean on the one hand I get it. Our specific government and those like it have STOLEN our hard earned wealth and GIVEN it to others. Furthermore this process has been carried out by a government civil service that is in no way a meritocracy. Therefore it&rsquo;s quite natural for a racially aware White to hate his government and what it is doing.</p>
<p>But is this an inherent quality and function of government or simply what a government based on flawed ideology resorts to in order to impose its broken ideology? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not sure that libertarianism has the potential to rally our people and to lay the groundwork for a feeling of community and oneness. I trust my White economic overlords no more than my White political overlords. Both have sold us downriver and bricked themselves up in secure enclaves.</p>

<p>Pardon me, but how is libertarianism good for whites? Sure you can pick and choose pieces of the whole that are good for whites, but the whole, the gestalt, of libertarianism, denies the right of people to engage in collective tribal socio-political organization.</p>

<p>With statements like this, you only show your lack of comprehension of the change in power that this country is in the process of undergoing. </p>
<p>If you think that this future multi ethnic, multi racial US will be a happy place then you are sorely mistaken. When multiple ethnic and racial groups are all struggling over power because no one is in the majority, meritocracy is the first casualty. Pure ethnic/racial loyalty wins out every time.</p>
<p>Most of us who gather here on AmRen have a clearer picture of where this country is headed than you. We understand that white racial awareness and solidarity is going to be crucial for the survival of our children and future white generations in this country.</p>

We only have about 20,000 distinct genes in the human genome, vastly fewer than had been imagined.</p>
<p>I use &#8220;environmental&#8221; in the most general sense of the term - I just read a paper about the influence of mindfulness meditation techniques on epigenetic expression that goes a long way to explain why meditative techniques are often healthful. &#8220;Environmental&#8221; intervention could involve a lot of different techniques, which could be improved upon by a better understanding of individual and racial genetics.</p>
<p>As far as &#8220;frankenscience&#8221; is concerned, it is going on as we speak. The potential for curing many diseases through genetic/epigenetic modification is a hot area in medicine. There is little to reason to doubt that the same techniques that show promise against cystic fibrosis could not be used for low intelligence as effectively.</p>
<p>If you find the idea abhorrent, let me assure you that China does not. Both the Chinese government and most Chinese parents are eager to boost the intellectual capacity of the next generation. Mr. Engelman provided a helpful chart of bell curves for different races. Imagine a world in which the numerically superior Chinese shifted the bell curve even further to the right, vastly increasing the number of IQ 140+ people even further.</p>

<p>Obviously my &#8220;frankenscience&#8221; barb was made in jest, but now I think I will use it in all seriousness. I have to ask, do these genetic manipulations result in the abuse or loss of human life, either in testing or in practice? And by human life I mean fertilized eggs, fetuses, and every stage of human life after birth.</p>
<p>But if so, then yes, I do find it abhorrent, and yes I am not surprised that the Chinese do not. If these genetic manipulations do not abuse human life and they only raise intelligence and reduce genetic defects, than i am OK with it. But I get the feeling that is not the case, and not only are humans are harvested and discarded for their genetic material, but they are also genetically manipulated for certain traits that a wicked ruling class might find useful.</p>
<p>I also suspect that these genetic experiments are going on surreptitiously in the Western world as well. The wickedness of man ever finds new ways to defile human life even though we are told that there is nothing new under the sun.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-409932" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>No apology needed, Johnny. Believe me, my days in the university are many decades behind me 🙂</p>
<p>There certainly are moral questions that need to be raised about genetic and epigenetic manipulation. In our discussion, I must state that my own career has been as a physical scientist, and I cannot claim more than an intelligent layman&rsquo;s knowledge of molecular biology, embryology and genetics.</p>
<p>Until recently, virtually all medical research in humans focused on eliminating severe genetic abnormalities in offspring focused upon changing the DNA to eliminate defects in the genetic code. I am not referring to medical interventions such as in-vito fertilization and screening of embryos - these certainly would result in the destruction of embryos that were found to carry a negative mutation. One area of research had been to replace the defective gene that causes cystic fibrosis, and some success was obtained by using a virus to inject the &#8220;patch&#8221; into nuclear DNA. The technique was used successfully on infants, but obviously the idea of using a virus to modify DNA (even though that is what viruses do) made most people uneasy.</p>
<p>The development of epigenetics has been very recent, resulting mainly from the successful sequencing of the human genome. We are starting to develop the capacity to change the ways that genes express themselves, and this opens up many new vistas for treatments that do not require modification of the genetic code in DNA itself. Most of our genes have molecular &#8220;switches&#8221; - some on/off and some multi-position - that can change the types of proteins they make. It&rsquo;s possible to study these kinds of interventions in tissue cultures or in adult volunteers to a large extent.</p>
<p>As you stated, the first emphasis in this work has to remedy the effects of undesirable genetic expressions, whether cystic fibrosis, Down&rsquo;s syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease or whatever. The same body of knowledge that will enable the reversal of these conditions could be employed to enhance abilities rather than to correct defects - at some point, to make people more intelligent and less aggressive, for example.</p>
<p>You point out correctly that there are a LOT of moral concerns about this kind of work that need to be addressed. Still, I believe that the work will get done - above ground or underground, in America or in North Korea - and that it is better to have a seriously debate about what to do about it.</p>

Yes it protects its borders from mass-immigration but although there is (still) a majority of white Jews, the whole population is multiracial and multi-ethnic, and seem a real melting pot. There are Jews from Ethiopia, Yemen, Iran, Morocco etc If the white Jews ever wake up and stop miscegenating (after all they are there as many leftists as here) it will be too late I think because Israelis are a few millions and so the mixing was/is very fast.</p>
<p>I foresee the general Israeli Ashkanaze high IQ to get lower<br/>
(~100), and therefor a notable decrease of Jewish achievements (1/3 to 1/2 less).<br/>
To stay an outpost of Western civilization, you need whites,<br/>
i.e. a big, proud and strong majority of whites. Israel is metamorphosing as much as our Western countries. Remember all is in the numbers, 50% or so of whites is not enough, sometimes 10% of non-white is enough to trigger third world aspects.</p>

Iranian Jews in America, too, seem to be very successful.The Ethiopians are, of course, Blacks, but the miscegenation rate for them is still low, lower than it is in America. As the intermarriage rate between the Askenazi and Sephardi Jews increases(as well as the ethnic Russians in Israel) you will probably see reduced IQ but still a first world, Jewish society.</p>

But there is also North Africans and there is a difference. Same with Iranian Jews. They can be successful but they are not white, although still Caucasians.<br/>
I don&rsquo;t know what is the miscegenation rate with Ethiopians but even a low one will have consequences as time pass, socially, politically and genetically. From articles like Razib Khan&rsquo;s &#8220;Genetics &amp; the Jews&#8221; in DiscoverMagazine, I gather that Ashakanaz Jews have an average of 5% Sub-Saharan DNA, what happens if this increase?</p>
<p>My post was addressed to John who 1) admires Ashkenaze for their IQs and 2) supports miscegenation and 3) wish to move to Israel. I am pointing to him that the Ashkenaze IQs will decrease to an average of 100 in one or two generations due to miscegenation, and so the average Israeli IQ will also sink. So I am not sure how much of a first world society Israel will end up being, unless it becomes racially aware. </p>
<p>Similarly the trend is happening in the western countries too, but we are ahead with sites like Amren and because our white demographics are bigger. But John writes &#8220;Public opinion in the United States is moving in my direction [&hellip;]. This can be seen in the growing acceptance and practice of<br/>
interracial marriage. Things that bother you are not even issues any<br/>
more.&#8221; I would like him to see the necessity to reject interracial marriage, to be bothered by it like we are, unless he is willing to witness lowering IQs: he may want only Chinese-Jewish-white marriages, but those seem the minority&hellip;: the Public opinion doesn&rsquo;t discriminate. One needs to choose his battles, what is more important.</p>

<p>There is no &#8220;meritocracy&#8221; to be a casualty. White males go to the back of the bus in job applications, school applications, scholarships and fellowships. It is disgraceful that a poor, disadvantaged white kid from Appalachia who happens to be more qualified for a job, scholarship, etc. will be passed over every time he has to compete with a person from one of the favored groups.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-414119" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Ahasuerus, the wandering Jew, is nothing but the<br/>
personification of the whole Jewish race. Since he sinned grievously against the Saviour and World-Redeemer, he shall never be delivered from earthly existence and its burden and moreover shall wander homeless in foreign lands. This is just the flight and fate of the small Jewish race which, strange to relate, was driven from its native land some two thousand years ago and has ever since existed and wandered homeless. </p>
<p>On the other hand, many great and illustrious nations with which this pettifogging little nation cannot possibly be compared, such as the Assyrians, Medes, Persians, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Etruscans and others have passed to eternal rest and entirely disappeared. And so even today, this gens extorris, this John Lackland among the nations, is to be found all over the globe, nowhere at home and nowhere strangers. Moreover, it asserts its nationality with unprecedented obstinacy and, mindful of Abraham who dwelt in Canaan as a stranger but who gradually became master of the whole land, as his God had promised him (Genesis 17:8), it would also like to set foot somewhere and take root in order to arrive once more at a country, without which, of course, a people is like a ball floating in air. Till then, it lives parasitically on other nations and their soil; but yet it is inspired with the liveliest patriotism for its own nation. This is seen in the very firm way in which Jews stick together on the principle of each for all and all for each, so that this patriotism sine patria inspires greater enthusiasm than does any other. </p>
<p>The rest of the Jews are the fatherland of the Jew; and so he fights for them as he would pro ara et focis, and no community on earth sticks so firmly together as does this. It follows from this that it is absurd to want to concede to them a share in the government or administration of any country. Originally amalgamated and one with their state, their religion is by no means the main issue here, but rather merely the bond that holds them together, the point de ralliement, and the banner whereby they recognize one another. This is also seen in the fact that even the converted Jew who has been baptized does not by any means bring upon himself the hatred and loathing of all the rest, as do all other apostates. On the contrary, he continues as a rule to be their friend and companion and to regard them as his true countrymen, naturally with a few orthodox exceptions. Even in the case of the regular and solemn Jewish prayer for which ten must be present, a Jew turned Christian, but no other Christian, may be present if one of the ten is missing. The same holds good of all the other religious acts. The case would be even clearer if Christianity were to decline and cease altogether; for then the Jews would not on that account cease to exist and to hang together as Jews, separately and by themselves. </p>
<p>Accordingly, it is an extremely superficial and false view to regard the Jews merely as a religious sect. But if, in order to countenance this error, Judaism is described by an expression borrowed from the Christian Church as &#8216;Jewish Confession&rsquo;, then this is a fundamentally false expression which is deliberately calculated to mislead and should not be allowed at all. On the contrary, &#8216;Jewish Nation&rsquo; is the correct expression. The Jews have absolutely no confession; monotheism is part of their nationality and political constitution and is with them a matter of course. Indeed it is quite clear that monotheism and Judaism are convertible terms. </p>
<p>The fact that the well-known faults attaching to the Jewish national character, of which a surprising absence of all that is expressed by the word verecundia is the most conspicuous, although this fault is far more useful in the world than is perhaps any positive quality; the fact, I say, that such faults are to be attributed mainly to the long and unjust oppression they have suffered, excuses them, it is true, but does not do away with them. </p>
<p>I am bound to praise absolutely the rational Jew who, on giving up old myths, humbug, and prejudices by being baptized, quits an association that brings him neither honour nor advantage (although the latter occurs in exceptional cases), even if he should not take the Christian faith very seriously. For is this not the case with every young Christian who repeats his credo at his confirmation? To save him even this step, however, and to bring to an end in the gentlest manner the whole tragi-comic state of affairs, the best way is certainly for marriages to be permitted and even encouraged between Jews and Gentiles. The Church cannot object to this for there is the authority of the apostle himself (1 Corinthians 7:12-16). Then in the course of a hundred years, there will be only a very few Jews left and soon the ghost will be exorcized. Ahasuerus will be buried and the chosen people will not know where their abode was. </p>
<p>This desirable result, however, will be frustrated if the emancipation of the Jews is carried to the point of their obtaining political rights, and thus an interest in the administration and government of Christian countries. For then they will be and remain Jews really only con amore. </p>
<p>Justice demands that they should enjoy with others equal civil rights; but to concede to them a share in the running of the State is absurd. They are and remain a foreign oriental race, and so must always be regarded merely as domiciled foreigners. When some twenty-five years ago the emancipation of the Jews was debated in the English Parliament, a speaker put forward the following hypothetical case. An English Jew comes to Lisbon where he meets two men in extreme want and distress; yet it is only in his power to save one of them. Personally to him they are both strangers. Yet if one of them is an Englishman but a Christian, and the other a Portuguese but a Jew, whom will he save ? I do not think that any sensible Christian and any sincere Jew will be in doubt as to the answer. But it gives us some indication of the rights to be conceded to the Jews.</p>

Instead, we got the tax revolt, the election of Ronald Reagan, and a Republican ascendancy that persists.</p>
<p>When Ronald Reagan was elected I knew he could not cut taxes, raise defense spending, and balance the budget like he promised to do. I over estimated the economic damage of the deficits his Voodoo Economics would cause. I did not foresee the decline in the world price of oil, which saved him.</p>

<p>You still have not explained. Do you intend to exterminate them? Do you intend to drive them out? </p>
<p>When I asked that question awhile ago someone said that if the government of the white ethno state stopped paying welfare checks the blacks would leave. That is not true for most blacks. They have jobs. It is true for an even smaller percentage of Orientals Nd Jews. Most of them have better jobs than most white Gentiles. </p>
<p>The slave trade should have never existed. The Immigration Reform Act of 1965 should not have been passed. We can&rsquo;t go back in time and undo those. There is a large non white population in the United States. There is no nice way to get them out.</p>

I suggest that we are going to have to redefine the terms of the &#8220;battle&#8221; from a political to a biomedical/genetic front. If we have learned one thing from the Human Genome Project, it is that the interplay between environment and genetics is a hell of a lot more complex than we ever thought it was. We can affect the expression of genetic traits - we are doing so already, to a certain extent. Bringing the genetic capacity of the entire population up to a higher intellectual and moral level seems Utopian, but I believe it is less so than trying to develop a successful racialist political organization.</p>

Why is it that every proposal to shut down all immigration is decried as immoral? National and cultural self preservation is healthy and normal and therefore moral.

<p>While the Platonic idea that evil is purely the result of ignorance<br/>
may not be fully correct, intelligence and evil do not often seem to go<br/>
hand in hand. In real life, one rarely comes across a Professor Moriarty<br/>

<p>As statisticians are fond of telling us, correlation is NOT causation. Possibly the moral imagination that you referred to along with intelligence itself are part of another quality, such as the ability to see things from another person&rsquo;s viewpoint. Or perhaps all of those things are part of some yet unknown fourth quality?</p>

I mean let&rsquo;s say you have an intervention that raise the IQ by 30 points (one such intervention albeit momentary is education, raising some 7 points), will all groups get the same intervention? </p>
<p>If so, the gap won&rsquo;t close: for example Caucasians after the intervention will still have some 15 points more than African Americans and so on. (Worse, what if the changes are not linear but exponential?The intervention may strenghten the differences.)</p>
<p>If not, then you will get called a racist, silenced if not more, to insinuate that for example African Americans needs more of the intervention than North East Asians. </p>
<p>Of course you may answer that you think the intervention will level the differences, but I think this would be wishful thinking. The idea that human intelligence is &lsquo;magical&rsquo;, not biological, is<br/>
not rational for me. It has a physical base like everything else in<br/>
existence. I think the difference of IQ is a fruit of evolution: environmental, adaptation, admixture etc. So unless your intervention is a brain implant&hellip;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-409940" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good points, Anna. We don&rsquo;t know enough about the epigenetic expression of intelligence to know whether an intervention would raise the IQ of all subjects equally or whether there would be different effects depending upon the baseline IQ. That is a reason I would like to see research in this area. We know of a variety of interventions in other areas that have differing results depending upon the seriousness of the condition - for example cholesterol-lowering statin drugs have far more effect upon people with really bad lipid profiles than upon ones with only moderately elevated lipids.</p>
<p>If we raised the median IQ of the black population to 100 (on today&rsquo;s scale) while raising the median white IQ to 115, I think we would be better off. Higher IQ will mean a better ability to engage in complex work, but more importantly, it correlates negatively with criminality and anti-social behavior.</p>

<p>1) every time we helped non-whites, it had come back to haunt us&hellip; </p>
<p>2)Also whites are tired of helping the others, why can&rsquo;t we help ourselves first?!: Will there be racial quotas for the distribution of your intervention? Shouldn&rsquo;t the intervention being done on whites first if white are the creators and enablers? </p>
<p>3) Anyway, not everybody will agree for the intervention, so what then? We will still end up with low IQs making many kids and the others bringing them in, paying for them etc.</p>
<p>4)Also to check the safety of such intervention will take a few<br/>
generations, and we don&rsquo;t have this time, our group is under attack NOW.</p>
<p> 5) Many whites here don&rsquo;t care about IQs, they just want to<br/>
be left alone in their own country with their kins. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if<br/>
the non-whites have 85, 100 or 130 IQ. </p>
<p>6) IQs correlates with criminality and anti-social behavior, but is it causing it or else? Will a higher IQ stop those or maybe trigger worse? The difference between the races, is not only IQs. </p>
<p>7) By 2050 there will be less than 300 millions whites and 2 billion 500 millions Africans. Can a higher IQ stop jealousy, ressentment and victimhood? Humans are tribal, intellect won&rsquo;t change that, natural instincts will remain the same but now you have created billions of non-white people with more intellectual skills: tell me why whites should trust a positive output. Science ahead of ethical matters can be a recipe for disasters&hellip;</p>
<p>8 ) Check Pathological Altruism, by Barbara Oakley et al.:</p>
<p>&#8220;PA is generally defined as a sincere attempt to help others that instead harms others or oneself, and is &ldquo;an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one&rsquo;s own needs.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&#8220;PA is likely when people &ldquo;falsely believe that they caused the other&rsquo;s problems, or falsely believe that they have the means to relieve the person of suffering.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;the false belief that one&rsquo;s own success, happiness, or well-being is a source of unhappiness for others.&rdquo; PA &ldquo;often involves self-righteousness,&rdquo; and can result in &ldquo;impulsive and ineffective efforts to equalize or level the playing field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;glorifying altruism is both recent and Western.&#8221; &#8220;a society must<br/>
have a certain level of material wealth before it can value certain<br/>
kinds of altruism.&#8221; &#8220;only Europeans have decided &ldquo;to elevate altruism above other culturally promoted ideals, such as tribal patriotism and glory-at-arms, which our ancestors considered paramount.&rdquo; They have gone even further, extending tribal altruism to the entire world, though &ldquo;some other cultures consider this Western quality to border on madness.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But the whites who say it is madness are accused of racism.</p>
<p>They are told that &#8220;Humanity as a whole might benefit the most if individuals made no sacrifices for their local group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems the whites are the only race who don&rsquo;t know about the<br/>
prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma! They cooperate! But all the other groups don&rsquo;t. Check that game theory: we lost, they win. Will your intervention fix this too? &#8220;if groups want to act altruistically towards other groups they should at least look for groups that follow the same rules.&#8221;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-410676" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>1 and 2) Hard to say who will develop the intervention techniques - remember all those Asians and Ashkenazic Jews who so heavily populate the upper reaches of medical and scientific research? If it they are developed first by a Chinese researcher, should they be available only to Chinese?</p>
<p>Again, there would be clear advantages to whites to higher IQ and improved social mores among blacks and Latinos. Clean water, sewage treatment and vaccination benefit the entire community - so do more intelligent and virtuous citizens.</p>
<p>Many other medical advances in recent years have plummeted in prices shortly after adoption - antiretroviral drugs for AIDS come to mind.</p>
<p>3) Some people certainly will refuse the intervention techniques for their children, and their children will be less intelligent and have more social and moral problems than would otherwise be the case. I don&rsquo;t know that the &#8220;refuseniks&#8221; would be more common among blacks or Latinos than among whites. How many people of any race would refuse to give their children these advantages? Ironically, some might be extremely liberal whites who are uncomfortable about giving their children even more &#8220;white privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>4) Safety is a concern, but bear in mind that epigenetic modification is less radical and more reversible than monkeying around with the actual structure of DNA. Some of these techniques might be purely environmental rather than pharmaceutical - increased sensory stimulation in infancy, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>5) No doubt true, but we live in a society with large numbers of people of other races. Whether they live next door or in a different part of the city, people with higher intelligence and better moral sense are to be preferred to the alternative.</p>
<p>6) Good point. I did state that correlation is not causation. We do not know whether the expression of intelligence itself means better impulse control and less criminality or whether all these traits may be part of an as yet undetermined factor. We DO know that criminality is strongly linked with low IQ - Professor Moriarty and &#8220;Heisenberg&#8221; are fictional characters, and their real-life counterparts are pretty rare.</p>
<p>7) Another good point. Would greater intelligence increase resentment of past perceived wrongs or reduce it? I can&rsquo;t positively say one way or another, but it does in general seem to me that as people have a wider range of options in life, they are GENERALLY (not always) more interested in taking advantage of those options than in settling old scores.</p>
<p>8) I certainly don&rsquo;t maintain that increasing intelligence and moral sense will automatically cause people to transcend group identification. There are examples both ways: for example, educated young Europeans tend to think of themselves as Europeans. On the other hand, in eastern Europe and the Balkans, we have seen ferocious intergroup hatred flare up, even between objectively similar groups such as Serbs and Croats.</p>

The issue is not immigrants .<br/>
The issue is there is an elite group of rich powerful and politically connected globalists who profit from immigration and pass on all the social, economic and environmental costs to us. By dumbing down western countries with massive immigration, they make the population easier to dupe and the nations easier to plunder. So far everyone that goes to Washington gets corrupted by them or they are removed.<br/>
Term limits might help, but it will be hard to beat them. However, our one hope is they always thought they could change A and B and C would stay the same. But C is waking up. But we have been asleep for a long time.<br/>
if anyone has time, go on youtube and watch the interviews with Sir James Goldsmith with Charlie rose. Goldsmith was a billionaire who warned against globalism 20 years ago and died shortly after .<br/>
He also wrote an excellent book warning about our future called The Trap.<br/>
Rand paul is a sheltered libertarian and a shallow thinker. he was never our leader. Any person on the right that preaches small government, or on the left that preaches disparity of income or the environment, but refuses to acknowledge the effects massive immigration has on their core issue, is not to be taken seriously. By their fruits you shall know them. Don&rsquo;t give up anyone. We are at the end of an era and a new one is waiting.<br/>
C is waking up.<br/>
Immigration is a wonderful litmus test to a persons thinking and a big time saver for us. If a person has immigration wrong, there is no need to waste any time or energy or thought on them. immigration can help is keep focused more than our enemies, stay focused people.<br/>

Maybe the problem is that we invested so much hope in him to begin with. Knowing what we know now, there was probably ample evidence hiding in plain sight from the first moment he started running for office that he would turn out this way. Even if there was, though, his overtures toward immigration patriotism and his disagreeing with his own father on the question of the Ground Zero Mosque in 2010 made us think that he was distancing himself from his father and doing so on ideological grounds and not just pure political expediency.</p>

Getting from there to Duke&rsquo;s position, however, is a leap too far. Look how hard it is to convince folks that the Republicans are just as bad as the Democrats! </p>

<p>Duke has no more chance than Romney. If the GOP plans to win, it needs to appeal to the largest segment of voters. Turncoats and fair-weather friends like Paul and SO many other republicans and right-leaning independents are not an asset. </p>
<p>Politically we worry that tossing someone like Paul out would open the seat for a democrat. Possible, sure. But, will anyone actually notice a difference? If they don&rsquo;t stick to their platform, toss them out.</p>

<p>One problem I know for anyone in national level politics is the money. They need vast sums of it. And the easiest way to get it is to suck up to the corporatists and banksters. To do that, they absolutely must kowtow to the PC media as the media would otherwise crush their benefactors with &#8220;racist&#8221; &#8220;sexist&#8221; &#8220;homophobe&#8221; labels. In the current environment, Rand Paul would have buried his political career if he had stuck with his comments about the Civil Rights Act or any of his immigration remarks.</p>
<p>I do believe there is a very large number of white Americans fed up with this and looking for change. They&rsquo;re not listening to the media except to scorn it. Even talk radio is missing the mark. But for whatever reason, these people aren&rsquo;t here on Amren. Maybe they&rsquo;re scared off by the lowbrow and even vulgar &#8220;white interest&#8221; sites? Unaware of a venue such as this? Maybe they&rsquo;ve just abandoned hope and turned inward, becoming preppers and isolationists within their family or very small social circle? Whatever the case, they&rsquo;re not here and this begs the question: How, when the media is 100% opposed to our interests, do we reach them?</p>

<p>If hundreds of politicians say the same, then the one with a pro-family, pro-white, anti-immigration etc message will get the spotlight, or at least the attention of the awakening whites. Actually, I am ready to just have ONE message for a start: anti-immigration, okay anti-illegal immigration. And then grow from there, after being elected. </p>
<p>I think the fed up Americans are not yet on Amren because the site is not known enough. But I predict this will change, more and more anti-white news are bringing people here. I was one of them a couple of years ago. Not everybody comments, it took me one year or so.</p>
<p>I comment here but also on the mainstream media blogs. Everyday, more of us tolling the bell, citing Jared Taylor and others, will bring recognition to our cause. It just takes time to find the listening ear or to unbrainwash a critical mind.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-412498" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Bear in mind that modest shifts in the midpoint of a normal distribution produce large shifts in the outliers. Caucasian Gentiles have a median IQ right around 100, Ashkenazic Jews about 110-115. That is almost a full standard deviation higher, resulting in a much larger proportion of extremely high IQ persons. Add in some cultural factors, and you&rsquo;ve probably pretty well covered the overrepresentation.</p>
<p>Again, Unz does not claim that pro-Jewish bias was a factor in universities outside the Ivy League. Places likeMIT, Caltech, U of Chicago, Stanford all have Ashkenazic overrepresentation as well.</p>
<p>Courtesy of Wikipedia: &#8220;While Ashkenazi Jews make up only about 2% of the U.S. population,[2] 27% of United States Nobel prize winners in the 20th century,[2][3] 25% of Fields Medal winners (mathematics),[4] 25% of ACM Turing Award winners (computer science),[2] 6 out of the 19 world chess champions, and a quarter of Westinghouse Science Talent Search winners[4] have either full or partial Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.&#8221;<br/>
It seems unlikely that bias could explain those chess grandmasters or science talent search winners.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-409492" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Even in a local election, money is king. I have some direct knowledge in this area both in running local campaigns and being an insider in others. Even something like a county commissioner or water district commissioner pays a decent salary and more importantly has health benefits and a retirement program much better than the private sector. Additionally, even these small city or county elections can cost a LOT of money. A smallish county election could easily run $200,000. That money comes from local businessmen who want illegal laborers. And there is the whole white status contest for who panders the most to the Afros which is pervasive. A candidate explicitly running on &#8220;white interests&#8221; would stand no chance whatever. And if someone became a champion for white interests once in office he risks losing his job perks (social circle now including the movers and shakers of the community) along with salary, health insurance, and pension.</p>
<p>In truth, about the best we can hope for is a candidate who doesn&rsquo;t pander to Afros or support illegals. Populism MIGHT have a shot in local politics as long as the guy NEVER says anything negative about Afros or illegals or anything positive about whites (racially). Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t see much utility in this. What is this guy going to be able to do for us?</p>
<p>The change MUST happen socially FIRST. The taboo on disparaging Afro culture must be broken. The taboo on disparaging mestizo culture must be broken. This can only be done with effective propaganda and since the media is 100% against us, it&rsquo;s a mammoth challenge. Still, it is our only chance.</p>

<p>Well said. The Rand Paul problem is also true on the local level. Even in &#8216;red&rsquo; voting towns and counties, almost all of their local politicians want to be successful and so will not touch racially or culturally taboo topics with a 10-foot pole.</p>

If not, here is one point treated in the book: there is this Hindu immigrant to France, who joins a bunch of proud French nationalists when France is overtaken by millions of non-white refugees. He is very verbal about his love/respect for the West and the white race and about his complete disagreement/dislike, with all the multiculturalists and multiracialists (I call them multists) and fight against them to death despite knowing the nationalists won&rsquo;t be able to stop the destruction of France. He told the nationalists they shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised of somebody like him, that why can&rsquo;t there be a &#8220;black&#8221; loving/respecting the white race and civilization and fighting for it when sadly so many whites are traitors to those two.</p>
<p>That said, I agree with all what you said about the muslims. Except ethnic cleansing, I prefer deportations to one&rsquo;s ancestors homeland. Humans are tribal, diversity brings friction: as I am against friction, I am against multism.</p>

<p>In addition, since hispanics are considered White for many purposes, polling being one of them, I suspect that the increase in the hispanic population contributes mightily to those statistics you mention. </p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the inherent flaw in polling; methodology is all important to understanding poll numbers. If you have not studied, and understand the methodology of a particular poll, you are unable to judge the veracity of it. The numbers mean nothing in and of themselves.</p>

<p>I have to say I tended to like what Ron had to say and was attracted by some of the positions he held and the way he could pierce logic through the usual fake positions of the usual suspects in main two parties you have over there.</p>
<p>It is a shame that Rand is throwing it all away.</p>
<p>Also, it is not exactly a surprise that this Ken Mehlman fella is part of a clique that has crawled into the movement and has sought to take it on a different route. To those in the know, I do not think it will be surprising either. </p>
<p>When it comes to the matter of &#8220;White Renegade&#8221; of the year, I originally presumed that it would be about the best or most successful person that has brought change for the better to our movement. Our own white renegade against the state of things, if you like. </p>
<p>So in an effort to try and promote some positive aspects to our cause, I would like to suggest that Amren has a dual award. One for the biggest turncoat to our people and one for somebody or some group that has done important or successful work for our cause.</p>

To shift the discussion to whether AA is in decline or not (a facetious argument at best considering AA is nearly universally practiced in order to avoid discrimination lawsuits) does a disservice to this debate over immigration. </p>
<p>You ameliorate your position on immigration by implying that even if White Gentiles become a minority they will still be part of a majority of White Gentiles, Jews, Orientals and East Indians. How is that good news? There will still be racial and cultural conflict between those groups. Your selective universalism is deceitful and self serving. You want the benefits of cheap labor, culinary choices, and prospective spouses that come with diversity, but you also want an alliance with the &#8220;best&#8221; races in order to protect yourself from the dark side of diversity.</p>
<p>I have nothing against small amounts of cultural sharing in any society, but to dress up what is clearly a war on Western Civilization and the middle class as progress is either ignorance or malevolence on your part. I am inclined to think the latter as you spend too much time on a this website posing as the &#8220;reasonable&#8221; leftist while ever reminding us that you, too, are a race realist because you also notice that black Africans are a disagreeable lot.</p>

My German naturalized x-husband, a PhD EE and I are still [friends] and business partners. We own a Berkeley/Menlo Park based R/D corporation which has made us a great deal of money from his nanotech patented inventions.<br/>
We hire exclusively graduate students or unemployed programmers/engineers. When one moves on, we replace him with another grad student or out of work U.S.A. Tech worker. We do NOT hire non-Americans. Not when Silicon Valley U.S. engineers and programmers are out of work, on unemployment, homes under water, thanks to greedy Tech industries hiring from abroad for half of what an M.S.E.E. would earn.<br/>
Almost every name encountered when a new grad applies for work here through an agency is clearly Indian, there existing a disproportionate representation <i> not only of Indian programmers but Indian recruiters. </i><br/>
It is common knowledge that India has a surplus, that there are many staffing firms from India operating in the US.<br/>
Silicon Valley is awash with Indians. For a reality check, visit a lunch room in one of the corporations. You will encounter mostly Indians. Don&rsquo;t tell me they &#8220;earned&#8221; those jobs. They are useful fools who will live 3 to a room, work for $12.50/hr.<br/>
More galling is the industries requiring a displaced American engineer/programmer to train a lesser skilled and educated Mr. Singh to do his lost job from the ground up.<br/>
As some discouraged Siliconers say: &#8220;just try applying for an IT job in the U.S.!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you flipped your lid, QD?&#8221;</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s beside the point. It doesn&rsquo;t take much mental horsepower to see how all but the first are social issues. But even foreign trade, which is seemingly an economic and only an economic issue, is actually a social issue at its bedrock. Ask yourself this: Why are almost all free traders also racial-ethnic egalitarians and advocates of open borders? Because the foreign trade question is loaded with the same undercurrent of universalism vs particularism as are the immigration and race equality questions.</p>

<p>Jr replies,</p>
<p>Open, blatant treason to your own people, open political prostitution doesn&rsquo;t win votes in Presidential elections. If it did, Jack Kemp would have been elected President.</p>
<p>Economic Conservatism/Libertarianism doesn&rsquo;t sell to voters in Presidential elections, never has, never will. so Rand Paul is reduced to pandering to e worst Blacks, homosexuals, Muslim immigrants, anyone and anything non White anti White. What will he gain from is this terrible treason?</p>
<p>Some media face time on the vicious, anti White MSM.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Judas at least got 30 pieces of silver .</p>

There are two primary strategies to counter the race-card play.</p>
<p>The first is direct honesty. Sadly, it is also the least effective and, therefore, seldom used by politicians. </p>
<p>The second is indirect aversion. That&rsquo;s what Ron Paul is doing. He is &#8220;proving&#8221; he is not a racist by reaching out to non-whites. Opening an office in Detroit is for show, but at least he&rsquo;s doing it on his terms. He knows the race card will be played and he&rsquo;s minimizing its effect. </p>
<p>Libertarian philosophy advocates freedom of association and, in my humble opinion, is consistent with race realism. Unfortunately, not everyone who wears the libertarian mantra embraces libertarianism.</p>

It&rsquo;s flat out racial treason, selling out our people for a little free MSM TV time. Rand Paul will now agree with ever what the hostile anti Whites in the room or interviewing want him to say, then he adds some Libertarian spin.</p>
<p>Rand Paul will suck up and pander to the worst Blacks, LaRaza, Muslim extremists, homosexual extremists are next on the boot licking pandering circuit.</p>
<p>Rand Paul needs to get a sex change operation&hellip; Become a man. </p>
<p>And folks, understand, he&rsquo;s not in any way one of our leaders.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the White traitor of the year for 2013. The worst.</p>
<p>I saw this one coming.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to include much of anything else except to note that Rand Paul and his small percentage of cult supporters also do the terrible American Right Wing trap of pushing wild, unsubstantiated Conspiracy Theories. Most fall under the insane idea that every single (White) American involved in any way with law enforcement or the military is part of an all powerful CONSPIRACY to kill or imprison regular Americans and implement an anti Christ one world government etc.</p>
<p>Rand Paul actually wasted our time with a filibuster demanding that the US Government stop targeting US citizens with get this:</p>
<p>Drone attacks!</p>
<p>The facts of the matter is the US military did kill some nasty Afro Arab Islamic extremist leader in Yemen. Rand Paul and Ron Paul and their cult insist this ugly, alien terrorist was a full US Citizen like you and ai based on the insane legal technicality of &hellip;</p>
<p>Birthright Citizenship!</p>
<p>These obsessions with wild, race denying conspiracy theories are a huge problem with White American Right Wingers, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to afflict nationalists in Europe.</p>
<p>No White American has ever been killed by a US military drone attack. We might as well become obsessed that beautiful Russian teen is stars are conspiring to sexually attack us! Anybody see Maria Sharapova plotting to come &#8220;get me&#8221;. Please give her my phone number.</p>

The problem the White-Right invariably runs into is a Catch 22 which dictates, in order for their Politically INcorrect candidate to be VIABLE they must conform to the Politically Correct status quo of the political establishment.</p>
<p>This is a sad reality that every candidate either knows about or soon learns after entering the political arena and is the result of the Democrat Party&rsquo;s move to the far-left and the Republican Party&rsquo;s move to the center.</p>
<p>This is what happens when the bad guys have been in control of the flow of information for fifty years.</p>
