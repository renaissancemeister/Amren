<div class="intro-paragraph">
Common Core Standards come to California.</div> 
</div> 


<p>It is late on a Tuesday afternoon and I am sitting in the school library, which was recently converted into a computer center. This means it can no longer be used as a library, but libraries are considered obsolete in the coming Common Core Standards (CCS) era. It appears that at least one third of the books have already been given away or boxed up and sent to the downtown book depository.</p>
<p>You see, Common Core Standards set new &ldquo;literacy expectations,&rdquo; reflecting a &ldquo;shared school responsibility,&rdquo; using new &ldquo;metacognitive strategies&rdquo; to &ldquo;direct thinking and learning,&rdquo; in order to prepare students for &ldquo;life in a technological society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Got all that? Neither have I.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CoreJumble.jpg?208409"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107246" alt="CoreJumble" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CoreJumble.jpg?208409" width="550" height="276"/></a></p>
<p>The CCS is just one more in a long line of schemes cooked up to &ldquo;close the gaps&rdquo; and try to improve black and Hispanic school performance. Among other things, the CCS will shift &ldquo;literacy&rdquo; away from the Western Canon to what will be 70 percent non-fiction. This will include how-to books, technical manuals, court opinions, &ldquo;global informative/explanatory texts,&rdquo; and &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; government documents such as the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Recommended Levels of Insulation, and California&rsquo;s Invasive Plant Inventory. Dead white authors are not part of the CCS agenda.</p>
<p>Common Core promises national standards that are &ldquo;robust,&rdquo; &ldquo;real world,&rdquo; &ldquo;aligned with college and work expectations,&rdquo; and &ldquo;evidence based.&rdquo; It will use &ldquo;best practices,&rdquo; be &ldquo;internationally benchmarked,&rdquo; and promises to close the pesky racial achievement gap that 50 years of &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; have failed to close.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CCS.jpg?208409"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107248" alt="CCS" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CCS.jpg?208409" width="550" height="413"/></a></p>
<p>Do not be fooled. CCS is a particularly insidious program of socialism, white guilt, global citizenship, self-esteem, and culturally sensitive language.</p>
<p>Words such as &ldquo;fireman,&rdquo; &ldquo;policeman,&rdquo; and &ldquo;chairman,&rdquo; are strictly forbidden in CCS. Instead, we must talk about fire fighters, police officers and chairpersons. Naturally, no one is ever &ldquo;disabled.&rdquo; He is &ldquo;differently abled,&rdquo; &ldquo;has disabilities,&rdquo; or is &ldquo;physically or mentally challenged.&rdquo; Students who commit outrageous crimes on campus are, believe it or not, &ldquo;behaviorally challenged.&rdquo; Students who fail repeatedly are &ldquo;at potential,&rdquo; as opposed to those who are likely to fail, who are &ldquo;at risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other day, all the teachers at our school were called in for a lecture on the new standards. &ldquo;We are honored today,&rdquo; the principal began, &ldquo;to have the area superintendent, recently voted educator of the year, to conduct our professional development and help us get ready for Common Core Standards implementation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get started right away,&rdquo; the area superintendent announced, writing a series of education acronyms on the board. &ldquo;This school is a designated Intensive Support and Innovation Center, an ISIC school, and it is the teaching methods, the <i>pedagogy </i>that needs to change. Teachers here are focusing on <i>product</i> and not on content and delivery methods, which is causing our students to fail repeatedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s our fault. We teachers call students who fail the same classes repeatedly &ldquo;The F Troop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So what does it mean to be an &ldquo;Intensive Support and Innovation Center, an ISIC school&rdquo;? It means ours is one of the worst-performing schools. Since bad test scores are our fault, it means the bureaucrats in their plush offices have decided to lather us up with a whole new layer of bureaucracy and browbeating. Among other things, this means &ldquo;professional development&rdquo;-teacher training every week. I can&rsquo;t tell you how much teachers hate this. The ISIC motto is the usual drivel: &ldquo;We Innovate and Transform Learning to Inspire Excellence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced around the room at the weary faces, and knew everyone was tired of being blamed for student failure. I looked at the math department and realized that not a single teacher among them had fewer than 25 years of experience. What is it we haven&rsquo;t tried? How<i> dare</i> this overpaid functionary lecture <i>us</i> about teaching methods? And what on earth does he mean by &ldquo;product,&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;content&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Although I knew better than to challenge district officials on education dogma, I was fed up with being browbeaten by out-of-classroom, clueless bureaucrats who work in cushy offices far from school campuses. &ldquo;How do we help students who enter our 11th grade classrooms with third grade reading skills?&rdquo; I asked stupidly, knowing district administrators are well trained to handle any sign of opposition to what they are so well paid to promote. The area superintendent was ready with a canned answer: &ldquo;You must scaffold, break down the lesson to make it more understandable for those students who need extra help in catching up. I suggest you break the students into small groups and have them teach each other the lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;how are students who read far below grade level expected to do homework assignments from the 11th grade text which I am mandated to assign to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homework shouldn&rsquo;t be assigned,&rdquo; the area superintendent responded sternly. &ldquo;The district superintendent himself said that homework should count for no more than 10 percent of a student&rsquo;s grade. You are focusing on productivity and not content and delivery. What do you think this is, a factory? A student who does not do homework falls behind the rest of the class and will be unable to catch up.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_107250" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lazy.jpg?208409"><img class="size-full wp-image-107250" alt="He might fall behind on homework." src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lazy.jpg?208409" width="550" height="322"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">He might fall behind on homework.</p></div>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t dare ask the question I really wanted to pose: &ldquo;How are students supposed to take the new, essay-only CCS tests on iPads, which we haven&rsquo;t yet received, in a school like ours that does not have WiFi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew that not one other teacher in the room would demand answers to my questions about CCS; they wanted me to shut up and let the superintendent finish so they could go home.</p>
<p>Friday was career day for 11th graders. The first speaker was an official from the Department of Power and Water. He started by asking the students: &ldquo;Where does most of our water come from?&rdquo; One student raised his hand: &ldquo;the ocean.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good answer, the official said, but most of our water comes from the Eastern Sierras.&rdquo; The official asked another question: &ldquo;Does anyone know where most of our power comes from?&rdquo; Another student raised his hand: &ldquo;From the sun.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the right track,&rdquo; the presenter said, &ldquo;but we haven&rsquo;t developed solar power to a great extent yet, most of our power comes from far-away generators.&rdquo; For raising their hands and answering the questions, each kid received a prize. That&rsquo;s the only way to get them to participate in a session like this one. Maybe these students need Common Core literature after all, I thought.</p>
<p>Later, that same afternoon, after a long week and as I was packing up to go home, the assistant principal knocked on my classroom door: &ldquo;We are getting a new student on Monday,&rdquo; he tells me casually, &ldquo;who has Sudden Death Syndrome. If any of your students see him passed out on the floor in the bathroom or out on the PE field, tell them to report it to the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wrote to a cyberpal in St. Louis about CCS: &ldquo;I see that your state, Missouri, is trying to opt out of the Common Core Standards that are being forced down our throats in California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the Democrat governor is the only politician in the state who wants it. Republicans, who dominate the state legislature, don&rsquo;t want it because it&rsquo;s another Obama boondoggle. Black Democrats reject it because they&rsquo;re bought and paid for by the teachers&rsquo; union, which doesn&rsquo;t want it because teachers&rsquo; careers, especially for teachers in urban black districts, will be at the mercy of their black students&rsquo; test scores.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_107249" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Opposition.jpg?208409"><img class="size-full wp-image-107249" alt="Opposition" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Opposition.jpg?208409" width="550" height="455"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Protesters in Indiana.</p></div>
<p>We should be so lucky in California. The state has embraced Common Core and plans to implement it in full this spring. Teachers like me are set up to take the fall when CCS, like all the grandiose programs before it, inevitably fails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Urban&#8221; law enforcement is almost, but nowhere near as bad, as education, when it comes to empty headed cliche-filled strategies. The main difference is that the buzz words change all the time but they refer to something which usually works. You hear the words &#8220;hot spot policing.&#8221; All it means is what cops are supposed to do, go to where the bad guys are and put them in cuffs.</p>

The modern sorting process does not consider micro ancestry, or ancestry of individuals, it considers the ancestry of a country as a whole.

Their 12 foot rotors are balanced to the thousandths of grams. The aerodynamic blades are made of very advanced alloys to handle the enormous centrifugal forces and corrosive effects of super-heated steam. The ingenious labyrinth seals are built to incredible tolerances since their is no actual contact between the rotor axle and the supporting frame. The axles themselves are huge chunks of high-strength alloy steel that must be precision turned on 100 foot long lathe beds that themselves are trued and accurate on the order of tens of thousands of an inch over their long run. The bearing surfaces are hardened and polished to a flawless, adamantine finish.</p>
<p>A steam turbine, even without considering the electronic controls, is in every meaningful sense of the word, &#8220;high tech&#8221;. Show me one (1) backwards country that has the ability to manufacture an advanced steam turbine and I will concede your argument.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-409442" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&rsquo;ve seen steam turbines in action, and they are anything but low-tech. For one, the shaft might start as a billet of white hot steel weighing 150 tons or more as giant presses bear down on it with thousands of tons of force to slowly work it into the correct shape. Then it&rsquo;s off to a furnace for heat treating then a dip in a vast water and chemical bath to further strengthen the steel. Then huge lathes and other machine tools turn the forging into a precision part accurate to a ten-thousandth&rsquo;s of an inch or better, necessary because it will be spinning at thousands of RPM as it powers the generator, itself a marvel of technology. The particular turbine I toured was at a nuclear power plant, it was as big as several tractor-trailer trucks and powered a generator to produce 1,200 megawatts of 12,000-volt electric current at full power. Three massive cables as thick as a man&rsquo;s leg carried the current to a step-up transformer, one of the most efficient machines ever invented by man, which raised the voltage to 500,000 volts then fed it to the electrical grid that powered homes all across the state. It was as big as a house, that transformer. The whole plant was state of the art technology, there is nothing low-tech about steam turbines, which also power nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers. The introduction of the steam turbine transformed ships from slow, fuel guzzling behemoths to fleet, fast vessels that ultimately were more fuel efficient and far more reliable than their reciprocating engine predecessors.</p>

<p>Maybe I have a skewed perspective since we actually have good quality schools in our county. Our only gripe is the limited selection of electives these days. </p>
<p>But the real benefit to the public education of our children has been their own awakening to the hypocrisy and outright lies regarding the relations of races in the US. If I had educated them in a petri dish, how would they have ever become aware? The hard way? I have children who know the signs of trouble from non-whites as well as some unsavory whites. </p>
<p>We have to teach them to survive within the rules and limitations of the environment they find themselves in. Not some fantasy world from the 60s that I personally got to watch fade into history. The irony of course is that most of what all the &#8220;evil white racists&#8221; were objecting to when desegregation of schools became law, have come to pass.</p>
<p>How does the world react when racists are actually right about something? They bury it.</p>

<p> Example 1 - the diagram that looks like the schemata for a weaponized atomic washing machine - says absolutely nothing, represents absolutely nothing more complex than what teachers have done for decades, centuries, millennia. It is nothing but the most ho-hum jargonized no-duh process of planning the course of a subject material.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not brain surgery and almost any reasonably intelligent person who gets paid more than 60,000 a year should be able to come up with easily. The biggest secret in professional education is that there is no big secret. There is no magical methodology to make all the lights pop on and prove that everybody is the same blank slate equal Mr. Boas (and Marx) assured us we all are.</p>
<p>The second one, the bullet of words aimed ultimately at our hapless kids (after ripping through our teachers first, of course) heads? Creepy. The creepiest part, however, is the fact hat the powers that be of &#8220;education&#8221; don&rsquo;t even get how creepy it really is.</p>
<p>Again, the worst part of this is the shocking Truth that in order to function as the brainwashing organ of our propaganda machine, the purpose of which is to institute civilizational suicide and racial genocide, our educational system has morphed from symbiotic to parasitic in nature over the course of the Affirmative Action brave new world era.</p>

<p>No to all of these. As a clarifying graphic it is an utter, abysmal FAIL. If this were included in the assembly instructions of the vacuum cleaner you had just purchased, would its format provide you with a clue as to how to proceed? What to take up first? And a sense of sequence?</p>
<p>As for the first graphic, if it is any reflection of the program&rsquo;s organization then it is also a FAIL. It appears to be a composite of word-association responses the organizing principle of which is a random scatter somewhat like a cross word puzzle.

<p>That today we are shutting down our Vocational Training in so many of our schools is distressing. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with hands-on learning. In reality, we all learn that way, though some of us go on to develop the ability to learn from books. How many of these dropouts would stay in school if they were enrolled in vocational rather than textbook orientated programs?</p>

The demand for jobs requiring higher IQ is increasing unfortunately the US population is showing a reverse trend. The best and least politically correct solution is to pay lower IQ women and men not to have children.<br/>

<p>Some children do learn better in different environments. Everything I know about chemistry I taught myself at the age of twelve and thirteen from a Gilbert Chemistry Set and reading on my own. I forgot what I learned from a high school class in the twelfth grade. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, excellence usually requires discipline. It always requires superior intelligence. Little can be taught to the illegitimate children of unmarried welfare mothers, violent street criminals, and drug dealers. </p>
<p>It is unfair to expect school teachers unfortunate enough to be assigned to ghetto schools to get the same results they could have gotten from kids with high IQ&rsquo;s who are trying to get into the college of their choice. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in several upper elementary classrooms over the past few years. The kids were taught according to the new liberal theories, and had no prayer of learning multiple-digit multiplication and division because they still drew dot diagrams to do 4 x 7. And a good portion of these classrooms were full of white, middle-class students.</p>

And I don&rsquo;t know what, if anything, is being taught under the rubric &#8220;new math&#8221; now. But it has nothing to do with liberalism or &#8220;progressive education&#8221;. The basis of it is that mathematics is about logical relationships between abstract structures, and that the way to teach it is to show the student how to establish those relationships. Certainly, any form of mathematics requires intelligence, but I should think that anyone with the brainpower to get through the math curriculum, could get through the new curriculum and do so faster and with deeper understanding. For those with IQs under 100, give them a calculator and hope for the best.</p>

<p>It was in Europe that modern rules for arithmetic were invented. The more primitive methods were effective, but much more difficult. </p>

If I ran education my plan would be simple:<br/>
1. All schools are private<br/>
2. Money is allocated to each student for 12 years 1-12 grades.<br/>
3. Parents choose from a myriad of schools.<br/>
4. Each state would set core standards and provide some oversight.</p>

<p>Kids are brainwashed with the following:</p>
<p>*America&rsquo;s Constitution is irrelevant because it was written by White slave holders</p>
<p>*Native Americans were peaceful, nature worshipers that protected mother Gaia.</p>
<p>MLK and Mandela were saints to be endlessly worshipped and honored.</p>
<p>Che and Mao were great leaders of the people.</p>
<p>*All races are have equal potential; IQ doesn&rsquo;t exist (except in death penalty cases).</p>
<p>*All cultures are superior to White American culture.</p>
<p>*ALL Whites are irredeemably racist, homophobic, sexist, barbaric and bigoted due to a legacy of slavery and colonialism.</p>
<p>*Guns are evil; the Second Amendment is outdated and needs to be eliminated.</p>
<p>* Global Warming is a proven fact.</p>
<p>Closed systems like the anti-White state religion are a breeding ground for monstrous contradiction and absurdity. Political correctness means that White genocide is the most honorable of all causes and that opposing White genocide is the most despicable of all acts.</p>
