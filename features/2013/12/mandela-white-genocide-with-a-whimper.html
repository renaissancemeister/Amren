<h1 class="title">Mandela: White Genocide with a Whimper</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Gregory Hood, American Renaissance, December 5, 2013</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
Madiba&rsquo;s true legacy.</div> 
</div> 



<p>Nelson Mandela is dead, and South Africa without &ldquo;Madiba&rdquo; will be much the same as it was before: a wreck of a country with slowly collapsing infrastructure, high crime, and the slow-motion genocide of Afrikaners.</p>
<p>None of this much matters to the opinion makers of what used to be the West. For them, the true hallmark of leftist totalitarianism isn&rsquo;t brutality &mdash; it&rsquo;s kitsch, and we&rsquo;ll see plenty of that. Mandela will be on every magazine cover, the Internet will be drowning in sentimental schmaltz, and Facebook will be littered with sanctimonious status updates.</p>
<p>The truth is, the saintly visage of Mandela &mdash; all crinkly eyes and warm smiles &mdash; conceals a violent past as a terrorist. He was the founder of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umkhonto_we_Sizwe">Umkhonto we Sizwe</a>, the armed wing of the African National Congress, and played a key role in the ANC&rsquo;s embrace of armed struggle after a &ldquo;general strike&rdquo; failed miserably. The first terrorist attacks took place in <a href="http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/umkhonto-wesizwe-mk">1961</a>. In 1962, Mandela left South Africa on an international trip to win support for a violent struggle against the South African government. He negotiated for aid for the African National Congress with various anti-Western governments, including East Germany and Communist China.</p>
<p>Among the countries that pledged him <a href="http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/armed-and-trained-nelson-mandela%E2%80%99s-1962-military-mission-commander-chief-umkhonto-we-sizwe-a">full</a> support were Communist Cuba and the Egyptian government of Gamal Abdel Nasser, a fellow &ldquo;anti-colonialist.&rdquo; Mandela&rsquo;s international activities also included detailed meetings on strategy with Algeria&rsquo;s National Liberation Army. Perhaps most importantly, with Mandela <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CE0QFjAE&amp;url=http://scnc.ukzn.ac.za/doc/AAmwebsite/AAMCONFpapers/Shubin,%20Vladimir.doc&amp;ei=7dfPUYKSGpLm8wTPtYGwCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6sqYz_jPpUvvu6nNATEuhuGQfAA&amp;sig2=uPqX44CAcBF7JlO3X7pPcg&amp;bvm=bv.48572450,d.eWU">acting</a> as an international agent for the ANC, the Soviet Union provided <a href="http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=250154&amp;sn=Detail">massive amounts of financial and military aid</a> to Unkhonto we Sizwe.</p>
<p>After this perverse version of international diplomacy, Mandela underwent intensive military training in Ethiopia, where he learned sabotage, bombing, and guerrilla warfare. Upon his return to South Africa, Mandela was arrested for leaving the country without a passport and for inciting a strike. Later, he was tried along with other members of the ANC in the famous <a href="../../../PDF_Books/rivoniaunmasked.pdf">Rivonia Trial</a>. The government alleged 235 separate acts of sabotage.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the South African authorities captured documents about Operation Mayibuye, a <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mandela/mandelaoperationm.html">plan</a> for a sweeping military confrontation with the government. Mandela was found guilty, along with almost all the other defendants. Because of international pressure, Mandela was sentenced only to life imprisonment rather than death, even though the government believed it had prevented a bloody civil war.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MandelaPrison.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-104763" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MandelaPrison.jpg" alt="MandelaPrison" width="550" height="390" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MandelaPrison.jpg 550w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MandelaPrison-300x212.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"/></a></p>
<p>Though Mandela was imprisoned before he could personally direct his organization&rsquo;s campaign of terror, there would still be blood. Mandela&rsquo;s group and the African National Congress went on to kill scores of innocent people, some via the infamous &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necklacing">necklacing</a>&rdquo; technique <a href="http://century.guardian.co.uk/1980-1989/Story/0,,110268,00.html">endorsed</a> by Mandela&rsquo;s wife, Winnie. The group became notorious for its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umkhonto_we_Sizwe#Bombings">bombing campaign</a>, most notably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Street_bombing">Church Street bombing</a> which killed 19 people. The group also mined rural roads used by farmers, which killed at least 120 people, many of them black laborers.</p>
<p>In 1985, the South African government offered to release Mandela if he would repudiate violence as a means to bring about political change. He <a href="http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/president-p-w-botha-offers-nelson-mandela-conditional-release-prison">refused the offer</a>. Mandela was later forced to admit that the African National Congress &ldquo;routinely&rdquo; used <a href="http://africanhistory.about.com/b/2013/04/14/14-april-1990-anc-admits-it-used-torture.htm">torture</a> against suspected &ldquo;enemy agents.&rdquo; Many of the ANC&rsquo;s violent activities were not directed at the apartheid government but against the Zulus and their political movement, the Inkatha Freedom Party. However, whites always remained a special target. Even after his release, Mandela was willing to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKiePbTcAfY">indulge in musical fantasies about killing whites</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of his trial, Mandela denied being a member of the Communist Party &mdash; <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/nelson-mandela/9731522/Nelson-Mandela-proven-to-be-a-member-of-the-Communist-Party-after-decades-of-denial.html">something we now know was a lie</a>. Mandela <a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/winnie-nelson-joe.jpg">worked closely with the Communist Party of South Africa</a>, and the African National Congress was <a href="http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=250154&amp;sn=Detail">sustained and supported</a> by the Soviet Union. Mandela never renounced any of his ties with Communist leaders. Only last June, the Huffington Post, which is scandalized by just about everything sensible, casually <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/27/nelson-mandela-fidel-castro_n_3509710.html">reported</a> on the close relationship between Nelson Mandela and Communist dictator Fidel Castro.</p>
<p>Because of these long-standing associations and violent tactics, Margaret Thatcher condemned the African National Congress in 1987 as a &ldquo;typical terrorist organization,&rdquo; and said anyone who thought they would ever run the government was &ldquo;<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/from-terrorist-to-tea-with-the-queen-1327902.html">living in cloud cuckoo land</a>.&rdquo; The Conservative Party youth distributed propaganda calling for him to be <a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hang_mandela-195x260.gif">hanged</a>.</p>
<p>The United States listed the African National Congress as a terrorist organization until 2008, and President Ronald Reagan strongly resisted efforts to impose sanctions on the beleaguered South African government. In this, he was supported by most of the American conservative movement, although Republicans such as Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, and <a href="../../../opinion/2012/05/shed-no-tears-for-richard-lugar.html">Richard Lugar</a> argued for confrontation with the white government, promising it would &ldquo;win Republicans the black vote.&rdquo; (Some things never change).</p>
<p>However, as tempting as it is to simply point out Mandela&rsquo;s past as a Communist terrorist, in some ways his reinvention as a &ldquo;reconciliator&rdquo; is worse. It is true that as President of South Africa, Mandela did not unleash a campaign of state directed violence against whites. Instead, he largely maintained the economic system for the benefit of those already in power, while systematically dispossessing middle class and working class whites, especially Afrikaners. Nor was this particularity surprising, considering Mandela and the ANC&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Though the African National Congress was aligned with the Communists, they received far friendlier treatment from big business than <a href="../../../features/2013/05/when-patriotism-meets-conservatism.html">did their nationalist Boer rivals</a>. Secret meetings were held between the African National Congress and South African business leaders even as the guerrilla war continued, and British business interests were instrumental in setting up talks between Afrikaner elites and the ANC. No such efforts ever took place between the captains of industry and the would-be leaders of an independent Boer Republic, suggesting that business leaders feared Eugene Terre&rsquo;Blanche&rsquo;s concept of an economy run for the &ldquo;folk&rdquo; more than they feared black rule.</p>
<p>In the negotiations that preceded the end of white rule, the ANC, business leaders, and the ruling National Party formed a united front against Boer nationalists and Afrikaner patriots, even to the point of opposing leaders such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constand_Viljoen">General Constand Viljoen</a>, who betrayed a Boer secession plan in exchange for a promise that a Boer homeland would be considered. Once Mandela got the concessions he wanted, he refused any such consideration.</p>
<p>President Mandela and his new regime concentrated on reconciling whites to the new government by means of widely publicized symbolic efforts while stripping them of any collective economic, social, or political identity. Mandela won praise for letting &ldquo;Afrikaner leaders&rdquo; such as F.W. De Klerk serve in his government, but this was nothing more than continuing his working relationship with collaborators.</p>
<p><a href="../../../nuusbriewe/hh/hh15/report.pdf">Poverty</a> among Afrikaners has <a href="http://censorbugbear-reports.blogspot.com/2012/04/afrikaner-poverty-soars-by-400.html">soared</a> in the years <a href="http://newint.org/columns/essays/2010/01/01/afrikaners-hit-bottom/">since the end of apartheid</a>, with thousands reduced to living in squatter camps. South Africa has one of the <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/14564621">highest crime rates</a> in the world and is famous for its gated communities and private security companies. The nation also has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_South_Africa">high rate of HIV/AIDS infection</a>, which isn&rsquo;t helped by black government officials who think the cure <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/international/garlic-aids-cure-minister-sidelined-1-1139699">is a diet heavy in garlic</a>. Mandela&rsquo;s response has been to criticize the media for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela#Presidency_of_South_Africa:_1994.E2.80.931999">focusing too much on crime</a>. He did nothing to stop what is now widely accepted as the opening stages of <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2012/08/genocide-looms-for-white-farmers/">genocide</a> against Boer farmers, and implemented anti-white racial preferences even as whites became an all but powerless minority.</p>
<p>Mandela achieved a reputation for magnanimity, presumably because he didn&rsquo;t simply try to kill all his political enemies, as many of his &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; colleagues did in other African countries. A great deal of this was simply media friendly gestures, such as Mandela wearing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_rugby_union_team">Springboks</a> jersey (a tale worthy of <a href="http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2010/05/24/review-of-invictus/">movie</a> apparently) or honoring former State Presidents when they died. Mandela was smart enough to understand that South Africa depended on whites keeping their wealth and technical skill in the country; he wanted to squeeze the goose that laid the golden eggs, not kill it. Wealthy South Africans and business interests, who were his allies early on, kept the South African economy from collapse, albeit from behind gated communities guarded by private security forces.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Afrikaners <em>as a </em><i>people </i>have been destroyed. The names of Afrikaner heroes have been torn from towns, streets, and public squares, and replaced with those of &ldquo;anti-apartheid&rdquo; leaders. The collective white defense forces known as &ldquo;commandos&rdquo; have been <a href="/news/2012/12/whites-and-guns.html">outlawed</a>, meaning that those unable to afford private security companies are left vulnerable to black violence.</p>
<p>Since Mandela refused any consideration of a Boer homeland, numbers alone ensure that Afrikaners are politically disenfranchised. More than 750,000 whites have <a href="http://digitaljournal.com/article/267776">left</a> the country, but Boer farmers are trapped. Their wealth &mdash; their farmland &mdash; is illiquid. If they did try to leave, confiscatory taxation would leave them all but penniless. Mandela&rsquo;s magnanimity consisted in keeping whites around to pay taxes to keep his one-party ANC dictatorship going, but denying them meaningful representation.</p>
<p>It will only get worse. His critics on to his left, including his murdering ex-wife, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2010/0311/Ex-wife-criticizes-Nelson-Mandela-and-many-South-Africans-agree">c</a><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2010/0311/Ex-wife-criticizes-Nelson-Mandela-and-many-South-Africans-agree">omplained</a> that black poverty has not notably improved since the ANC takeover. Because there is no thought to lifting the <a href="../../../features/2011/12/into-the-cannibals-pot.html">restrictions</a> on white economic activity and thus creating more wealth for everyone, blacks are turning to their usual policy alternative: outright confiscation. Julius Malema, former ANC youth leader, is forming a new political party with the specific purpose of &ldquo;fighting white males.&rdquo; The government is even trying to <a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2013/04/23/ngo-too-white-for-donors">stop charities from helping poor whites</a>. South Africa is already exploring &ldquo;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22967906">land reform</a>&rdquo; on the Zimbabwean model, which has plunged the former Breadbasket of Africa into dystopian chaos &mdash; to the indifference of the world.</p>
<p>Even the largely symbolic magnanimous gestures, like keeping the Springboks, have been reversed. As the social norms of the state founded by whites fade away, everything declines. Today, the State President of South Africa is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma">polygamous Zulu</a> who thinks you can wash away HIV with a shower, and he&rsquo;s probably better than whoever is coming next.</p>
<p>Mandela deserves full responsibility for all of this. From the beginning, his dream was of a unitary South African state dominated by black voters supporting a leftist political party, with a thin crust of whites to fund it and keep it going. South Africa&rsquo;s decline into criminality and chaos is simply these ideas playing out to their logical conclusion. Independence, apartheid, and even the terrorism of the AWB were all Afrikaner attempts to avoid exactly what has occurred: political dispossession followed by measures that will lead to collective economic and social extinction.</p>
<p>If anything, a sudden outbreak of anti-white violence upon Mandela&rsquo;s death would be a good thing. It would give the Afrikaners &mdash; a warrior people if there ever was one &mdash; a reason to fight back. Instead, the legacy of Mandela is the slow genocide of the people who turned South Africa into a First-World nation in the midst of the Dark Continent. Though some whites will be suffered to live, work, and die for the benefit for their black masters, whites have no future in South Africa, and what few opportunities they have for even a decent life are shrinking every day. Mandela represented exploitation under the guise of magnanimity, murder in the name of democracy, genocide with a smile. We should mourn the old terrorist&rsquo;s death only because he didn&rsquo;t live to see his destructive work undone on the day when the Boers &mdash; and the rest of us &mdash; are once again free.</p>

I&rsquo;ve never met a black that does not believe that Africa was the beginning of world civilizations, and that African men were all kings, geniuses, architects, philosophers etc. What happened was whites stole all their knowledge and gifts. My question to them which has never been answered and causes automatic flipout is: If that were ever so, how is it that no black people&rsquo;s group or people have ever repeated this greatness or ever replicated it? Usually if a people are a great people they can always thrive no matter where they are; somehow they find a way to survive. With the negroes it has never happened so it is impossible that it ever took place in Africa, unless it was built by Egyptians or Arabs which are no relation to them, and they think they are. So that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re always wearing Egyptian style jewelry. It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>

This idea of &#8220;stolen knowledge&#8221; is purely an invention made up by simple-minded primitives to excuse the mental shortcomings of a society that never went past the most rudimentary uses of fire. Every other civilization in the world save the Africans and the Australian aborigines either invented or happened upon and recognized the uses of the wheel, among other things.<br/>
Knowledge is not a tangible object that can be physically touched, handled or &#8220;stolen&#8221;. What one person of a group discovers and uses, others of the group see and if it is an improvement to the quality of their lives, the others learn, use, and understand. Even a 3 or 4 year old child understands the advantages of using a round object to move large or heavy loads, even if it&rsquo;s just a piece of a tree trunk that rolls!</p>

The usual explanation is they didn&rsquo;t have draft animals to pull wagons so didn&rsquo;t need it. I&rsquo;ve never bought that- the wheel is a pretty useful multi-purpose thing, even without oxen or horses. Still, I guess it&rsquo;s some excuse for them and the Abos. But SSA? They had some proximity to the mideast where the wheel was in use. What the hell is the blacks&rsquo; excuse for wheel-lessness? The idiocy is astounding.</p>

I say this not to apologise for Jews, but merely for the sake of accuracy. Our enemies are the elitists who want to destroy the white race through soft genocide (and a hard genocide in South Africa and Zimbabwe). Their main weapon is their ability to create money through the fractional reserve system, as coordinated by the Federal Reserve and similar privately-owned and controlled central banks in other countries.

<p>I, too, up until a day ago, thought that Mandela was a communist-terrorist who did incalculable harm and no good, but when I stated this backward opinion on a website filled with GoodPeople™, I was properly instructed otherwise. I have decided to mend my ways, and work towards a brighter future for humanity.</p>
<p>I learned some things about myself  &mdash;  that I am the Grand Dragon of the KKK, a Nazi, a Fascist, a racist, a bigot, a rightwing lunatic, a moron, in need of a library card, a stupid-nasty-little-man, uneducated, brainwashed, and lacking the ability to think critically.</p>
<p>I learned some things about other people as well. I will quote some of that wisdom here and now, so that you awful people can be properly illuminated:</p>
<p>Quote from a member of GoodPeople™ Incorporated:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Science does not support your racist opinion. Cultural values are taught to all people and differ. Education in the values and virtues taught by all religions can propel mankind to greater heights. Although individuals have differing capacities, each and all races have equal capacities and capabilities when properly educated in the arts and sciences. Science proves this repeatedly.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And this (after I said that everyone is always better off when black people are properly managed, since they cannot manage themselves):</p>
<p><i>&#8220;You think that skin pigment inhibits self government? Do you have any moles on your skin? Does that limit your thinking?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I am not making any of this up. These are actual quotes from GoodPeople™. I copied and pasted these.</p>
<p>So, my epiphany is now complete. I&rsquo;m moving to South Central Los Angeles. Gonna make some new friends there. Who will join me?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-392785" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>After reading this piece on Amren, I rushed over to CNN and left a comment that as of now has 117 upvotes and 32 downvotes. CNN must be in shock at the number of negative comments on Mandela, many of which were deleted. What I wrote was this:</p>
<p>Quote:<br/>
Yes, CNN would prefer that we forget Mandela&rsquo;s terrorist activities and the fact that he was an anti-white Communist until his death, squeezing to death the white goose that laid the golden egg. The genocide of the white Africaners under Mandela will only get worse, but don&rsquo;t expect to read about it here. You have to go to the British newspaper websites (even the far left ones) to get the truth. If not for the Daily Mail, and even the leftist Guardian, the only thing I would know about SA is the leftist propaganda, which ignores the genocide on whites, Pakistanis, Asians, and even Somalis by SA blacks. Anarchy will now be complete with Mandela dead.&#8221;<br/>
End quote.</p>
<p>Naturally, there was furious backlash, the dumbest of which was that the white government of SA genocided the blacks. Yeah right, that&rsquo;s why there are so many blacks in SA and why Mandela was allowed to live.</p>

Through their actions of questioning the media, and whether or not issues are are presented as one-sided, it seems that there are many people here that are not unAmerican, but are American.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget Mandela was a front man. The destruction of SA had a lot to do with money, diamonds, and hatred of Whites. But Mandela had nowhere near the abilities needed to be a true leader, to take over so to speak. He&rsquo;s simply a puppet, like Sharpton in the US, but on a larger scale. Kind of like Obama one could say. His handlers tell him what to do, what to say, and he gets out there and puts on the show. Joe Slovo is someone to keep in mind. Look him up, who he was, what he was.</p>

<p>The media and its plutocrat masters care.

His family are now the new super rich, latest Mercedes driving, gold mine owners in South Africa while the masses still starve,<br/>
One man&rsquo;s terrorist is another&rsquo;s freedom fighter, depending on who wins in the end.<br/>
I never see any gratitude for when we &#8216;evil&rsquo; Whites relinquish control, so why do we bother?<br/>
But then how much power do us individuals really have, I&rsquo;ve never seen a platform that I&rsquo;d subscribe to get past the grass roots level, as rich big business conservatives seem to speak for all conservatives these days, like the way progressive liberals seem to speak for all liberals.<br/>
That &#8220;the power of one&#8221; is a platitude left for those who give that which was not theirs to start with to the masses, where as downsizing, restraint, self reliance are not populist issues.<br/>
Democracy surely must inevitably lead to socialism and then communism, once people get to vote for whoever gives them the most. The super rich like corporate citizens, live in a global, border less world free of sovereign nations. Where they can hop from country to country shopping around for the worst laws for workers rights to manufacture in and then the lowest high income tax rates countries for the super rich to live in, it&rsquo;ll take centuries for them to run out of countries to liquidate, rape and plunder too.<br/>
Us proles aren&rsquo;t meant to notice any of this, as we&rsquo;re kept divided and conquered fighting amongst ourselves for the scraps and our forever overlapping rights being conflicted by all these opposing groups, who&rsquo;re strategically and deliberately put in close proximately to each other.<br/>
Look after yourselves South African Whites.</p>

It&rsquo;s really just an inside joke, poking fun at the Chairman Mao, Che Guevara Hipster T shirt crowd i.e. what I think they really ought to be wearing in this bumper sticker slogan, politically trendy epitaphs world (think of how iconic that Obama &#8216;Hope&rsquo; poster was&hellip;.I hope he goes away soon).</p>
<p>I have a couple of &#8216;racist&#8221; T shirts, with text such as &#8216;white&rsquo; or &#8216;Question diversity&rsquo; (yes, made in honor of Amren&rsquo;s QD) and even as innocuous as those are, I still find that I don&rsquo;t have the energy to defend those ideas out in public(thanks again to the benefactor if you&rsquo;re still out there). Maybe softer slogans that have a general pro-white message would be safer like simply &#8220;I&rsquo;m proud of my heritage&#8221; or see some of the ethically specific designs over at CofCC i.e. &#8220;German, Celtic, Swedish pride&rsquo; etc.<br/>
Or maybe something as simple as &#8220;Western Civilization, you&rsquo;re welcome&#8221;. But if you get you ass kicked for simply saying you&rsquo;re proud of being German descended, it shows how screwed up the world really is.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s quite as clear, though, that the interests of South African blacks were not in some ways advanced by the reversal of power there. I can really only answer this for myself, but I&rsquo;ll pretty much always choose freedom and self-determination - even if it means I might get myself into trouble - over being husbanded around like a domesticated animal, just so that I don&rsquo;t get myself into trouble. I know that&rsquo;s oversimplifying things, but I see that as being one of the fundamental structural changes that SA underwent as Apartheid broke down.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-392731" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>From the chancellor, we at Berkeley received this:</p>
<p>Dear Campus Community:</p>
<p>Today, the UC Berkeley campus mourns the loss and celebrates the life<br/>
of Nelson Mandela. We are all part of a global community united in<br/>
grief and reverence for a man whose clarity of moral purpose and<br/>
extraordinary perseverance brought freedom to the oppressed, hope to the<br/>
hopeless and light to all the dark places where human dignity struggled<br/>
to survive. We pause to not only mourn but also to reflect with<br/>
gratitude on the good fortune we had to witness all that<br/>
Nelson Mandela accomplished and exemplified.</p>
<p>At Berkeley we also remember the special ties that will forever bind<br/>
our campus to this man and his movement. As we know, the Bay Area was<br/>
the epicenter of the American anti-apartheid activity due, in no small<br/>
measure, to the passionate engagement of Berkeley students. In 1990, on<br/>
a worldwide tour after serving 27 years in prison, Mandela spoke to a<br/>
crowd of 60,000 at the Oakland Coliseum. During that speech South<br/>
Africa&rsquo;s future president specifically cited our university&rsquo;s &ldquo;Campaign<br/>
Against Apartheid&rdquo; as having been particularly significant in hastening<br/>
the end of white-minority rule in his country. That recognition<br/>
highlights what is, in my opinion, one of Berkeley&rsquo;s proudest moments.</p>
<p>Today, I am also thinking about something Nelson Mandela said that<br/>
goes to the heart of who we are and what we stand for as a university:<br/>
&ldquo;Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the<br/>
world.&rdquo; With that in mind, I have asked our academic leadership to begin<br/>
working on a Spring event that will celebrate Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s life and<br/>
extend his legacy through an exploration of, and discussions about his<br/>
historic accomplishments.</p>
<p>Words alone cannot pay adequate homage to an extraordinary life that<br/>
so deeply altered the course of history. We can truly honor<br/>
Nelson Mandela only through our ongoing individual and collective<br/>
efforts to ensure that every man, woman and child reaches the final<br/>
destination on humanity&rsquo;s long walk to freedom.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Nicholas B. Dirks<br/>
Chancellor</p>

<p>Nationalism *IS* divisiveness.</p>
<p>That is the whole point here: You cannot have both nationalism and &#8220;inclusiveness&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;White English South Africans don&rsquo;t consider themselves British&#8221;<br/>
Well, that&rsquo;s partly true. Its more a generalized multicultural internationalism than that old-fashioned Britishness. That&rsquo;s also why you &#8220;White English South Africans&#8221; can turn into &#8220;White English Australians&#8221; in absolutely no time at all. Why? Because &#8220;South African&#8221; is only a geographic distinction with no ethnic meaning. It will change as soon as you change your geography, i.e. as soon as you step out of the plane you&rsquo;ll be indistinguishable from a &#8220;White English Australian&#8221;.</p>
<p>A real ethnic identity, with a specific culture and language cannot be changed so fast and so easily.</p>
<p>The last thing Whites need is some internationalist melting-pot. We need small independent healthy nations that are independent from each other and also in peaceful competition with each other.</p>
<p>If &#8220;White English South Africans&#8221; were a real ethnic group, they would have founded their own Orania or Kleinfontein by now. But they are not and that is why Orania and Kleinfontein will exist in 100 years while &#8220;White English South Africans&#8221; will be long forgotten.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-392926" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Centralism is not working.</p>
<p>I have already posted how centralism destroyed the Italians, Germans and Europeans in general.</p>
<p>Another example is the USA: When the &#8220;union&#8221; was in fact not a real union but a weak federation, the Americans conquered the continent. Also at that time the states had different religions and radically different laws. After the civil war it gradually became a centralized state (a real union) and the USA deteriorated to what it is today.</p>
<p>Centralism may have some benefits in the short run but in the long run it always destroys.</p>
<p>And now you propose a centralist system for all Whites - are you sure you are on the right side?</p>
<p>Also, the whole hatred between Afrikaners and English exists only because they were forced to live in the same country. When different people live in different countries there normally is no hatred between them because there is no quarrel about the ethnicity of the president, there is no quarrel about the school curriculum, etc.</p>
<p>So yes, we need to divide to reduce the tension. No language shall be enforced upon anyone and every ethnicity must have the right to make their own laws.</p>
<p>Oh and BTW, the coloureds verengels quite fast these days. In 30 years Afrikaans will be the language for Whites and English for non-Whites.</p>
<p>The same thing also happens on a global scale. Even the French blacks call themselves by the English term &#8220;Blacks&#8221; and not by the french term &#8220;noires&#8221;.</p>

I reject Afrikaner nationalism for the failure that it is, especially in the unique South African context with multiple groups of whites - not just Afrikaans and English.</p>
<p>It was this same sort of &#8220;Afrikanerdom&#8221; mentality that sold Rhodesia out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe if we show the world how much we support black majority rule in Rhodesia, they will leave our little South Africa alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, white nationalists all over the world where screaming their heads off at this narrow-minded, naive mentality. And like we had predicated, 20 years later South Africa met the same fate.</p>
<p>Remember, you &#8220;Afrikaner nationalists&#8221; also have a certain level of inclusiveness. You would not like to see tension between the French Huguenot descendants and Dutch descendants, but every so often it flares up again. You also try to bring together those that identity as &#8220;Boer&#8221; or just as &#8220;Afrikaner&#8221;.</p>
<p>Afrikaners are nothing more than a language group based on a Dutch dialect.<br/>
If Steve Biko was able to bring together different bantu tribes with different languages to support a common black consciousness, then why can&rsquo;t we do this for whites?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already happening though. The global white nationalist movement is bigger than any other nationalist movement. Even the Golden Dawn pledge common European solidarity.</p>
<p>The unfortunate consequence of rejecting a common white consciousness will mean the creation of a new &#8220;Jewish race&#8221;.<br/>
If &#8220;Afrikaners&#8221; like you do not acknowledge this fact, it will result in Afrikaners being known as the &#8220;new Jews&#8221;, ie - a tribe that does not and cannot assimilate into any other common European identity.</p>

<p>When centralism did not work for the Germans, the Italians, the Europeans, the Americans&hellip;</p>
<p>Why do you think it will work for Whites?</p>
<p>Can you even cite one example in history where centralism really worked?</p>
<p>Do you still not understand that Whites always prospered when there was freedom and always declined when there was centralism?</p>
<p>Bismark united the Germans. The birthrate immediately fell from 5 per woman to 2.5 per woman in one generation. Do we need that for Whites?</p>
<p>What you are proposing is a hell where Whites will kill each other for the leadership positions. It is a hell where different lobbying-groups constantly fight over power (just look at the USA). It is a hell where the centralized state would crush any dissent with force and kill White families as collateral damage. It is a hell where internal power-struggles suppress any positive energy. It is a hell where White soldiers are forced to fight pointless overseas wars. It is a hell where a single person is so insignificant and without power that an aura of helplessness and despair.</p>
<p>Goddamnit - it happened so often in history, why are people still so brainwashed to think that &#8220;this time it will be different&#8221;?</p>
<p>The White race will not be saved by trigger-happy childless bachelors in torchlight-parades.</p>
<p>It will be saved by hardworking families in free societies.</p>
<p>You join your torchlight-parade with all the other childless hedonists who will be forgotten in 30 years. </p>
<p>I am raising a family - and my children are not your property. I am building the future, you are just masturbating in delusional thinking.</p>

<p>When did Afrikanerdom work in South Africa? Besides handing over South Africa to terrorists, what else did your beloved broederbond do?</p>
<p>The fact remains that we are part of a global nationalistic movement based around white racial consciousness. This is why AMREN has articles on South Africa because they feel solidarity with us. Most &#8220;awakened&#8221; Europeans also have a common white identity.</p>
<p>The only people i&rsquo;ve met who oppose a common white identity are people like you who are still bitter about the Anglo-Boer wars and hate everything English.</p>
<p>If you really cannot understand the need for a common white consciousness in South Africa where whites make up only 9% of the population, then you are lost.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-392963" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;When did Afrikanerdom work in South Africa?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the South African Union.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides handing over South Africa to terrorists, what else did your beloved broederbond do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, I agree with you fully here. The apartheid-system was terrible for Whites: The White taxpayer had to support useless Bantustans and useless welfare-recipients. Whites soldiers had to die defending Black bantustans.</p>
<p>So why was this terrible system in place? Because power-hungry politicians wanted to lord it over the whole of SA. If Verwoerd would have reverted the Treaty of Vereeniging, this terrible history would not have happened.</p>
<p>But wasn&rsquo;t the apartheid-system exactly what *YOU* are proposing? To force all Whites into one state and hoping that all will be well? To think that &#8220;a common white identity&#8221; will be enough to support the state?</p>
<p>In fact that is exactly what I mean. The apartheid-system did not work, because OF COURSE Afrikaners and English were in a constant power-struggle. Power-hungry people from both Afrikaners and English were able and willing to sell their peoples out for short-term gains.</p>
<p>The apartheid-system was yet another example of why centralism does not work. OF COURSE the various sub-groups of a centralist state will fight with each other for power.</p>
<p>The solution is of course that each group has to respect each other group. Instead of engaging in endless power-struggles and pointless intrigues, every group should build up their own vision. That way the strong can thrive and the weak can copy the strong.</p>
<p>Also it would have been a good opportunity to lose the bantustans once and for all. If the SA is abolished and no free White republic assumes ownership of the bantustans, they can be just treated as foreign lands - and Whites would be much more than 9% of the remaining republics.</p>
<p>Now I certainly agree that Whites have to stand together in times of organized war, i.e. when a centralized command is needed to implement a military strategy (i.e. concentrating forces to attack a weak spot of the enemy).</p>
<p>But we are not in an organized war, we are in an unorganized war. A union between the Cape and Pretoria does not benefit either in any way or form. So I would certainly agree to something along the lines of NATO, but certainly not to a unified state.</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t you realize that your global perspective prevents you from actually doing something? When you are waiting for the &#8220;world revolution&#8221;, you will likely wait forever.</p>

<p>In India, the political fragmentation made it possible for the British to colonize the continent, despite the fact that they were woefully outnumbered - whereas large scale European colonization of China was impossible precisely because China was a unified and centralised state.</p>

<p>How would a union between White English and French people help either to defend their homeland? (How does the EU help?)</p>
<p>The fact is it would not and that the EU does not. On the contrary, the whole &#8220;unionization&#8221; brings a huge load of political baggage that just makes solving the real problems harder and not easier. Just look at the EU.</p>
<p>The contrary way is the solution: A split up Scotland has much more chance to solve the immigrant problem than the &#8220;United&#8221; Kingdom. The UK would have it much easier to solve its problems without the EU.</p>
<p>I fully agree that friendship and mutual appreciation are needed, but that cannot exist in a union. Appreciation can only exist when you accept that the other group exists and exists in a way different than your own. And that means that you have to accept that the other people may choose a different tax-system a different school curriculum and also a different language than yourself.</p>
<p>Also you must know that creating a &#8220;union&#8221; was a major motive for these wars. In America, the &#8220;union&#8221; was also the major motive for the civil war.</p>
<p>Unions cause tension and war.</p>

Yorkshire is a classic example, as they have a very strong regional identity, but there are others which could be based largely along the lines of the old Saxon kingdoms. 53+ million people under one centralised govt, which is what the population of &#8220;England&#8221;is now (and fast increasing) is absurd. 5 million under one govt is already far too many but would be a big improvement. I would prefer it to be no more than 100,000 per political unity, united in a loose confederation of like-minded mini-states and city-states.</p>

<p>The advantage non-English-speakers like for example the Welsh have is of course that their language can act as a shield against non-Whites - there are almost no non-Whites in Irish or Welsh language schools.</p>
<p>I think that in 100 years, only groups that have some identity that differs from the Anglo-American mainstream will survive - that can be a different language but maybe a religion or something else.</p>
<p>Britain has become is truely terrbile and suicidal. If you live in a suicidal society, you have to isolate your family from it, otherwise your family will dissappear, too.</p>

Good for them. Just don&rsquo;t ever tell us Whites hypocritically that WE Whites and ONLY Whites need to be multicultural but not anyone else. That is the very height of hypocrisy.<br/>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the twelve(12) senior executives of the &ldquo;Big Six&rdquo; media corporations, nine(9) are Jews or have Jewish spouses. This is a numerical representation of 75%. Jews are approximately 2% of the U.S. population.* Therefore Jews are over-represented among the senior executives of the &ldquo;Big Six&rdquo; media corporations by a factor of 37.5 times(3,750 percent).&#8221;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-393050" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Mary McGrory, in her May 12, 1994 column said that &ldquo;Nelson Mandela has won what the [Washington] Post calls &lsquo;one of history&rsquo;s sweetest victories over racial subjugation&rsquo; and he is going to keep it clean and beautiful so that newspaper readers will think they are reading scripture when they read dispatches from South Africa that cannot be read except through tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the left for you folks. Mandela as messiah. Mandela&rsquo;s South Africa has given the world terms (Google them if you don&rsquo;t know what they are) like &#8220;rape gates&#8221; and &#8220;jack rolling.&#8221; Under Mandela South Africa went from prosperous nation to third world toilet - what nation on the planet has the highest rates of rape and one of the top highest rates of murder? Google it. Thirty years ago South Africa had a space program, today if you Google &#8220;baby rape epidemic&#8221; you&rsquo;ll see that South Africa comprises most of your top results. Gee thanks, Mandiba.</p>
<p>Mary McGrory made a prediction almost 20 years ago and it turned out wrong. I&rsquo;ll make a prediction too. Twenty years from now South Africa will come to increasingly resemble Zimbabwe (another nation that threw off the &#8220;onerous&#8221; burden of white rule - once the &#8220;bread basket of Africa&#8221; now the &#8220;basket case of Africa&#8221;). Whites will continue to flee, at least the ones who can afford to (see the BBC story &#8220;Do white people have a future in South Africa?&#8221;) the rest will continue to dwindle in number as atrocities rise. The Western world will continue to ignore all this just assuming that history had a happy ending in South Africa when Mandela rose to power (any dissent from that position will be shrugged off as racism). Any problems will be shoved in the bulging file labeled &#8220;legacies of Apartheid.&#8221;</p>

Summary:</p>
<p>Of the sixty-four(64) senior executives of the major television broadcast networks, cable networks, and production companies, fifty-seven(57) are Jews or have Jewish spouses. This is a numerical representation of 89%. Jews are approximately 2% of the U.S. population.* Therefore Jews are over-represented among the senior executives of the major television broadcast networks, cable networks, and production companies by a factor of 44.5 times(4,450 percent).</p>

<p>* According to latest statistics from the US Department of Homeland Security, about 129 South Africans were granted asylum between 2001 and 2010;</p>
<p>* Immigration New Zealand&rsquo;s general manager for settlement, protection and attraction, Stephen Dunstan, said 48 South Africans had applied for refugee status since 2006. All were rejected; and</p>
<p>* Germany&rsquo;s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees received nine applications for asylum between 2009 and 2011.</p>
<p>As for Brandon Huntley who tried to seek asylum in Canada after being attacked repeatedly in SA DUE TO THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN:</p>
<p>&#8220;Former Canadian prime minister Joe Clark believes the decision to give &#8216;racial oppression victim&rsquo; Brandon Huntley refugee status in Canada should not have happened.</p>
<p>A diplomatic row erupted last month when Huntley, 31, was granted refugee status in Canada on August 27 after claiming he had been attacked because of his race.</p>
<p>In his application Huntley, who grew up in Cape Town, claimed he was persecuted as a white man in South Africa, had been the victim of seven attempted robberies and that the South African government was doing nothing to protect him.</p>
<p>But the Canadian government is challenging the board&rsquo;s decision in the Federal Court. &#8216;Most Canadians were astounded by the ruling,&rsquo; said Clark. He refused to speculate whether Huntley would be deported.&#8221;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-393271" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The first step is to give up the term &#8220;racist.&#8221; I always put the word in quotes. It is primarily a smear word against whites. Sam Francis had an article discussing this about a decade ago. The least problematic definition of &#8220;racism&#8221; is an explicit double standard that benefits one race at the expense of another. This is still problematic, though, since the only such double standards we have these days are anti-white.</p>
<p>The fact is that the universe itself is &#8220;racist,&#8221; since it gives different innate average characteristics to different races.</p>

Everything I have learned of the Dutch,German and French descended Afrikaners has given me the utmost respect for these beautiful, physically powerful, intellectual and artistic people.<br/>
Who literally carved a country out of that savage land armed with their faith (and rifles), with their unique culture and phenotypes still proudly existing to this day, 400 years after arriving in the heart of Darkness.<br/>
For them to be subjected to the world&rsquo;s first concentration camps, but to then be rewritten as histories villains is one of those great injustices that only a few people will ever know about.<br/>
They&rsquo;re magnificent rugby players too, if the ANC left them alone, they&rsquo;d be the constant no.1. but they&rsquo;d prefer to be 2nd while forcing racial quotas.</p>

It is an easier and quicker process if you actually go there. You can stay legally up to six months. While there, get to know people and look for work. Also, get involved with a church. Church people are often kind and professional. They would be good contacts and go the extra mile to help you. Also, get in touch with other SA expats living in Australia. </p>
<p>The UK is overpopulated, expensive and they have a horrible crime problem. As you know, their non-whites are terrorizing whites there with dispossession, assault, rape, murder, and mutiliation. The schools are being destroyed, and white school children can go nowhere unmolested. In the UK, only the very wealthy can live in relative peace and safety. The UK is becoming South Africa. Other countries in Western Europe are suffering the same fate. The United States has black rule now. WE ARE SOUTH AFRICA. </p>
<p>Australia has problems, but at least there is still hope for them. I suggest you go there. You cannot simply apply from your home country and expect results. You probably will not be accepted. You actually have to go there and get your foot in the door.</p>

<p>Seriously folks, the media and the its corporate backers are making a<br/>

<p>How?</p>
<p>By lowering wages by increasing the supply of labor and by increasing the number of consumers and workers in america,</p>
<p>The corporations want more consumers and more cheap 3rd world labor,<br/>
and one way they get it is by raising the social status of nonwhites.<br/>
Making Mandela a demigod is one way to doing this.</p>

Amazing that not one so called &#8220;white&#8221; country wants to allow them in as either immigrants or refugees. Certainly they look more Australian, Canadian, British, Dutch, Belgian, Swiss or German than the trash they take in by the 10s of thousands now. We are our biggest enemy.</p>
<p>Now look at the background. Despite being poor the Afrikaners are much neater than the blacks in a similar run-down township. Sure they don&rsquo;t have the money to paint the house or buy shoes but I spot a little flower garden and I don&rsquo;t see any chicken bones or lots of rubbish all over the place. Even in the worst circumstances we are better than them.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-394505" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thank you. I have for reasons previously given stopped posting on AmRen except occasionally when English concerns are raised. I know what you are talking about, especially in the South African context, though I have a more nuanced explanation; I appreciate what Harold Soref did in Britain and Percy Yutar in SA . </p>
<p>The BBC has surpassed even our print media in its &#8220;predictably relentess&#8221; (Rod Liddle) coverage of Xhosa Christ. I am planning to expose this fabrication of the &#8220;liberal&#8221; media in a chapter in a book to be called &#8220;Leftist Lies and Legends&#8221; to which I have to give priority. Their Emperors have no clothes, though their dupes have their T-shirts.</p>
<p>The &#8220;anti-fascist&#8221; ethnically Anglo BBC Director, Huigh Carelton-Greene, laid down a specific rule: &#8220;No place for &#8216;racism&rsquo; in the BBC&#8221; &amp; its programmes. South Afriica (like South Vietnam) was the target of constant attack, often with sheer falsification. The word &#8220;racism&#8221; then, as elsewhere, incrementally redefined, and &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; in its widest application. Writers like Ed West (qv) actually understate the case against TV leftist bias and infiltration, including (please note) its Palestinian sympathies.</p>
<p>All for now, but thanks again.</p>

2.

3. I hoped that AmRen could be mainly a constructive forum for positive, practical and inter-national action, rather than just a commentary on the latest usually depressing news-item.</p>
<p>I still read AmRen, support its basic aims, and will make occasional sporadic comments, particularly if the English people are attacked.</p>

How did we not notice the exponential increase of their numbers to the point where now the treasonous newsmedia presents them as the real English, in the hope that people will not notice? How far gone do people have to be to not notice it? There&rsquo;s another movie that looks like London in the not-too-distant future and it&rsquo;s called &#8220;Children of Men&#8221;. I really got scared by some of those scenes in that movie. Are we being softened up for the future, or primed so we aren&rsquo;t shocked when it does happen? I don&rsquo;t know, I believe not to count chickens before they&rsquo;re hatched and I see a lot of white people becoming far more vocal these days because they see this encroachment for the first time.</p>

When you view it as a means to protect and advance a society while preserving ethnicity and race then it makes sense. Right now Christianity is a strange parody of Monasticism which is why whites can&rsquo;t connect to it. Whites are denied all of their ancestral history that created Christianity, while Negros are free to invent a history that never existed. Many whites can figure this out instinctively, but all whites are denied a common voice to express it openly.</p>

The latest word is that the odious Westboro Baptist Church plans to go to South Africa and picket his funeral. Normally I think they ought to be ignored or better yet, exterminated. However in this case, I think it might be a wonderful idea! They are outwardly white, and therefore would provide the dark citizens of South Africa with some nice entertainment, and the provision of such would rid us of them, as well. Might I suggest necklacing?</p>

Your SADF sure did kick A against those Cubans and Soviets, against superior numbers, but then your/our enemy are dirty preferring to fight woman and children after coming out of the shadows.<br/>

But, when another (white) teacher tried to suck up to her and say how much better South Africa is because of Mandela and the ANC, she was having none of that. Neither was I. We both turned on this moron and told him just how bad things are for the white farmer in South Africa; how he&rsquo;s being raped, tortured, and murdered; how the president of South Africa gets on TV and sings about killing the white farmer; how it&rsquo;s nothing short of genocide in that country.</p>
<p>I was mystified, actually. How can my colleague both cry over the death of Mandela and yet understand exactly what&rsquo;s going on to whites in South Africa?</p>

And they are not white. Neither are the people really in charge. You arrest a few for some things and sometimes they&rsquo;ll spit that in your face. That&rsquo;s ok. There&rsquo;s nothing like sitting them in a holding tank next to one of their multi-cult tools. They use blacks and browns but they are actually terrified of them. And all the dark folk see is another white man to prey on. Tough luck. They&rsquo;re the ones who worked as a conniving group to ruin this country.</p>

We see them in gangs here in L.A.. But from their behavior and low intelligence levels you can bet they would be more at home in some Central American jungle with a blowgun, hunting monkeys for breakfast. They are so unaware of the wider world around them that it still amazes me after years of having to chase them down.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-396967" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I couldn&rsquo;t figure this out until recently.  My best friend is a Russian Jew whose family fled before the Iron Curtain fell in the 80&rsquo;s.  Then like today the Jewish &#8220;leaders&#8221; are constantly tearing down whites, Christians, and Western civilization at all costs.  The elite Jews, like the elite whites, remain unaffected by their policies.  The elites in Russia turned against the evil &#8220;Kulaks&#8221; (in America we&rsquo;d call them Rednecks).  The Jews in the shtetl suffered their policies and hatred as the white Christians.  In their &#8220;Jewishness&#8221; they blamed the world but in reality it was their own.  In the city the Jews the didn&rsquo;t play along where considered &#8220;rich capitalists&#8221; and were destroyed.  Ayn Rand talked about this at great length.</p>
<p>Now we have an entire modern mythology about the &#8220;suffering&#8221; of Jews because of whites, as opposed to the lunacy of their leaders.  In South Africa the Litvaks organized and rallied against the white Christians chanting &#8220;Kill the white Farmer!  Kill the Boer!&#8221;  That went really well until the Boers weren&rsquo;t around to kill.  Then what whites are Left?  The Litvaks.  Guess who is targeted next?  The Litvaks.  Who do they blame?  Everyone but themselves.  Now we&rsquo;re presented with an endless stream of Mandela the messiah as Jews lament the passing of Joe Slovo and Jewish domination in South African politics as seen in Haaretz recent article.</p>
<p>Now in Israel there&rsquo;s Orthodox Jews that riot against the state, launder money, live off of welfare, and refuse to serve in the army.  This is what my Russian friends complain about the most - the Orthodox.  The Orthodox see themselves as the perennial outsider fighting against the world, even when the world is Jewish.</p>

I&rsquo;ve wondered this for years and can only see that they have to, at least, take a portion of the country for themselves, if not all of it.  Occasionally I read that some Black Africans long for the day when Rule of Law would return.  That, in my mind, would mean the return of power to White People.<br/>
Just thinking about how all this will pan out over the years, after all people need to eat don&rsquo;t they?</p>

Then we could use our respective Citizenships to free them, bring them to countries which aren&rsquo;t as bad, and then have three or more children with them.  We don&rsquo;t need to wait for official governmental policy to change!  We do it ourselves!  It keeps them alive and we grow!  Who likes this idea?  How do we do it?</p>

Since our arrival in Africa in 1652, we have been fighting for survival. Nothing has changed much during the last 300 years, but this time around we decided to throw our weapons on the ground in the hope for peace through dialogue. (1994). I remember the day when Nelson Mandela was released from prison. I was about 11 or so.</p>
<p>Since then I have fled from SA to Europe out of fear for my family`s lives. I have 2 small children aged 6 months and 3 years for whom no future in SA exists. Some mornings I wake up in my new home here in Switzerland wondering how I ended up being a refugee. How could it be? It all still feels like a weird dream. </p>
<p>I am not one for racial talks and tension so note that I have no agenda. What I can say is that what you hear about a white genocide in SA is absolutely and shockingly true. Children, parents, and especially the old people are targeted due to their skin color. The crimes that are being committed are nothing short of hideous and unjust. I grew up on a farm in the old Transvaal just outside of Pretoria. One day we discovered our neighbor having been burnt with an iron and strangled to death with a kettle cord. She was a 70 year old who could not and would not hurt a soul. </p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the Boer in SA are in dire need of help. Please hear our call.</p>
