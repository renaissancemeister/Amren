<p>When I was in school, the schools in my district (Ferndale, Michigan) were all named after presidents, with the exceptions of one of the junior high schools and Ferndale High (which had once been Lincoln High). I went to Washington, Jackson, and Theodore Roosevelt Elementary. The other five elementaries were Harding, Taft, Grant, Jefferson, and Wilson. The one junior high was Coolidge (where I went). I graduated from Ferndale High in 1991.</p>
<p>Either our Founding Fathers will be painted as terrorists (Aaronson, Jones, and Rutherford in 1984), or they&rsquo;ll somehow disappear down the memory hole.</p>

Half of the nation&rsquo;s young probably can&rsquo;t name a single president between Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt because so much attention is given to the &#8220;progressives&#8221; when they are taught history. All of the attention is put on the &#8220;founding fathers&#8221; (usually to decry them as racist slaveowners) and all of the more recent presidents from FDR on. Very little attention is given to 19th c. presidents from before and after the Lincoln-Reconstruction era.</p>

<p>That would have to include even some black people, because there were free blacks who owned slaves.</p>
<p>I am not condoning the evil of slavery, but not everyone during the time here was slavery in America, who owned slaves, was an evil person. For example, Thomas Jefferson was a liberal by 18th Century standards.</p>
<p>Indeed, there were kind, good, and ethical slave owners who considered it immoral and unethical to free a slave, unless you first had that person taught to read and write, taught and gave that person other skills, needed to survive upon emancipation.</p>
<p>One time during the Revolutionary War, a slave was captured by the British Army. This slave could have enlisted in either a black Loyalist regiment, or a black British regiment, and have acquired his freedom. But instead, he chose to risk his life to escape-back to his master!</p>
<p>Hollywood usually portrays slavery as the master living in a big house, with the slaves getting whipped by overseers in the field. But more often than not, a family would own perhaps four or five slaves, who would work alongside with their master in the field, small factory, shop, or other small business, and eat with the master, and his family.<br/>
However, Hollywood would never make such a movie about such lower middle class slaveowners, because it just would not be dramatic enough to sell movie tickets at the box office.</p>

From the Wikipedia entry for the book &#8220;Time on the Cross&#8221; by Professors of Economics, Fogel and Engerman:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fogel and Engerman asserted that slavery had a reciprocal economic benefit for slave owners and slaves. They wrote, &#8220;[S]lave owners expropriated far less than generally presumed, and over the course of a lifetime a slave field hand received approximately ninety percent of the income produced.&#8221;(p. 5-6) They were estimating the value of housing, clothing, food and other benefits received by the slaves and argued that they lived as well in material terms as did free urban laborers; life was difficult for both classes.&#8221;</p>
<p>NOTE: SLAVES KEPT 90 PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME. YOU PROBABLY GET TO KEEP 50 PERCENT. WHO&rsquo;S THE SLAVE?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-399276" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>That&rsquo;s a good quote, but let&rsquo;s be clear. Not slavery itself, but slavery under the White man and more importantly White civilization. Even something as oppressive as slavery is better under Whites than freedom is under blacks.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t exclusive to blacks either. Most people don&rsquo;t know their history, partly because the media is nothing but anti-White propaganda and they lie by omission every chance they get. Did you know that most White immigrants to early America were under the yoke of slavery? Most people don&rsquo;t know that. Most European Whites who wanted to immigrate were impoverished, they had no way to pay for the trip over and no prospects once they got here, so they willingly sold themselves into a form of slavery, indentured servitude. This was temporary slavery for a certain period of type and then Whites won their freedom.</p>
<p>Of course African freedom posed a problem because blacks were a different race, so we could not allow them to win their freedom and assimilate with society. Blacks were and still are a biological threat to our civilization and race, so they had to be kept in perpetual bondage and separated from Whites. At the time Whites were far more rational and didn&rsquo;t want their race amalgamated. </p>
<p>The Brits had a much better strategy for dealing with miscegenation than their Latin counterparts in South America, and instead of a racially mixed caste system which provided upward mobility for non-White admixture, we had a hard color line in North America with the one-drop rule.</p>
<p>We hear so often how terrible slavery and segregation were, but in fact keeping blacks oppressed and separated had a very beneficial effect for White survival and racial purity. Without it we would be more like Brazil today and the struggle would be over.</p>
<p>Another example is even imprisonment in Northern European countries offers a better standard of living than freedom in African countries, LOL.</p>
<p>Come on, we all know this to be true, it&rsquo;s obvious. As much as third-worlders bemoan White &#8220;racism&#8221; and inequalities between the races, they come to White nations in droves, they risk their very lives to get here and live under &#8220;White privilege&#8221; because they know their lives and their children&rsquo;s lives are immensely better. What thanks do Whites get? The dark hordes are brazenly ungrateful, resentful and want to destroy us without remorse.</p>

But have you ever listened to Pierce&rsquo;s <i>American Dissident Voices?</i> You can listen to them on : <i>Dr. William Pierce Audio Archive (308 Radio Broadcasts)</i>.They are full of insights and still a source of inspiration. Pierce wrote also a book called <i>Who We Are</i> which can serve as a history of the white race. It can be read on line.</p>

A mob of black demenstrators, led by &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Al Sharpton, occupied and closed the Statue of Liberty recently, demanding that New York be renamed Martin Luther King City &#8220;to reclaim it for our people&#8221;.<br/>
Hmm. I hate to agree with Rev. Al, but maybe a name change is in order. Welfaria? Zooville? Rapetown? Dirtburg? Lazyopolis?<br/>
But Al, the Statue of Liberty? Next time, hold that demonstration at a food stamp bureau or crack house.&#8221;<br/>

Just because it&rsquo;s higher than so many non-white groups does not mean that the average white person is some kind of genius. You&rsquo;ll find that the lower one goes in IQ, the more emotional and less logical people become. Less intuitive. Less creative. More shortsighted. The more intelligent a person is, the fewer people he will find in the same class of intellect. Such should be considered when one looks at the original construction of the American Republic, which was never meant as a mass democracy.</p>

<p>4 religions(philosophies) originated from the sub-continent area which went on to greatly influence East, West Asia (even West eventually to an extent) while only a violent cult originated from the Arab world.

South America, NA, Australia, Europe, Greenland - nearly all continents have countries that either have a White majority or significant White population. East Europe is still largely White, just like sub-saharan Africa is largely Black. Large swathes of US are largely White too. If not for the huge Hispanic population in the US, which is largely illegal, US would be significantly (upwards of 75%) White right now. Can&rsquo;t blame anyone else for a country not protecting its borders, can you ? Not even the Jews, honestly.</p>
<p>I often hear Japan being cited as a model for a homogeneous country. While I completely agree with the benefits of such composition, Japan is an exception in the world, not the rule. It is a tiny island overshadowed by a giant next door with similar racial makeup. Whites ventured out to all corners of Earth and mixed with others, brought some back to their homelands as well. Japanese never ventured out this way. The other example cited is Israel. Mark my words, Israel is a ticking time bomb. A place similar to Japan actually is Papua new guinea, a small island with high levels of homogeneity. </p>
<p>And with populations swelling, communications and travel becoming easier, businesses expanding heterogeneity becomes inevitable to a degree. When world population falls back say 1900 levels at some point for whatever reason you&rsquo;ll again see the level of isolation that existed earlier. </p>

destruction of our schools and Universities and we have forgotten our past. I<br/>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-405905" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Oppression, abuse and genocide of White/Europeans in Western Countries.</p>
<p>(Oppression)</p>
<p>Impoverishment - Creating an unstable economy with a high-rate of low-income jobs, a very low minimum wage, a high-rate of people with unseen and unattended health and medical problems - either because they can&rsquo;t afford it or the national health care can&rsquo;t. Increases homelessness, increases prostitution, increases depression and insomnia, increases suicide, increases tension and conflict and thus crime.</p>
<p>Second-class Citizenship - Degrading the people of the founding nations to a second-rate group, who, despite being the biggest tax payers, automatically come last-served for everything essential and needed for them to live properly. This is exploitation in pure form, and is any BUT privilege.</p>
<p>Insufficient Housing - This makes people homeless and completely poor, especially working-class whites who are way at the bottom of the social ladder. The working-class, non-whites get treated as royalty in comparison.</p>
<p>Insufficient Jobs - This makes people jobless and poor. People are even more likely to need benefits. This increases tension, increases crime and robbery, and puts an even bigger strain on the economy.</p>
<p>Insufficient Land Space - Destroying the heritage of the land, the hills and countryside, and cramming it with over-population and facilities. Creating a claustrophobic environment with reduced overall life quality.</p>
<p>Affirmative Action - Reducing the likelihood of skilled and well-educated whites getting jobs who must step aside first for any non-whites, even if they are unskilled and poorly-educated. And action put in place to feebly hide the inherent inequality of IQ and competence of different races. As usual, whites pay for it.</p>
<p>(Abuse)</p>
<p>Physical Abuse:</p>
<p>Murder – Constantly increasing from the non-white immigration, making the environment less safe, more fearful, more unpredictable, and subsequently, reducing white numbers even more with higher incidents of death by murder.</p>
<p>Rape – Constantly increasing from the non-white immigration, again, making the environment less safe, more fearful, more unpredictable, and subsequently, reducing white numbers even more with (forced) conceiving of mixed-race children.</p>
<p>Molestation – A physically violating and emotionally destroying act that white children are being horribly subjected to more and more, particularly with increasing Muslim immigration.</p>
<p>Emotional Abuse:</p>
<p>Gas-lighting - Repeatedly denying that (intentional) race-replacement is an act of ethnic cleansing, while it is happening to us and all around us. Telling us that we are wrong and nothing destructive or harmful is happening to us. Teaching our people we don&rsquo;t exist as a people or racial group, and encouraging us to breed-out with non-whites through endless propaganda. Teaching our people we are inherently bad and deserve to suffer and pay for our history. Teaching the non-whites the same thing and encouraging them to feel-free to abuse our people, either emotionally or physically, and take full advantage of our hospitality.</p>
<p>Invalidation - Dismissing and/or disregarding our serious fears and concerns for our people and culture on the basis that we are simply racist.</p>
<p>Humiliation - Mocking, teasing and rubbing it in our faces that we&rsquo;re quickly becoming a racial minority in our own nations, which is somehow justified and inevitable. Telling us how great and enriching it is for us while dismissing our feelings and opinions at the same time - even getting us to celebrate our declining influence and numbers, and dispossession.</p>
<p>(Genocide)</p>
<p>Declining Birth Rates – Forcing mass immigration with a high-birth rate onto a declining population with a low-birth rate can only be intentional, thus all the more genocidal in nature.</p>
<p>Abortion – Intentionally destroying our white numbers before they&rsquo;re even born, on top of our low-birth rate.</p>
<p>Race-Mixing – Giving beauty and brains to other others races when they receive our admixture - while being consumed in the process in a form of what can only be genetic canabalism, and thus reducing our numbers even more - suicidal even as our birth-rate is already too low. The heinous mutilation of the beautiful and creative white race though race-mixing is perhaps beyond evil, especially when intentional. It&rsquo;s a win-win situation for non-whites.</p>
<p>Rape – Forced sexual acts and the possibility of forced race-mixing from non-white men raping white women at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>Murder – White numbers reducing through the murder of whites by violent and aggressive non-white influx.</p>
<p>White Flight – The mass immigration of non-whites and their alien culture, their crime and poverty, and their unwanted presence encourages - almost forces white people to move out of towns, cities, and areas, eventually leading to those places becoming predominantly non-white, not to mention crime-ridden as hell.</p>
<p>Suicide – The grinding strain and psychological effects of being terribly wronged by our governments, dispossessed, made to live in intolerable situations, impoverished, homeless, robbed, attacked, raped, abused, confused, and saddened. The fear, anxiety and unpredictability of our bleak future and living in the wake of our catastrophic destruction in the coming decades when our people and culture are reduced to minority status in our own nations, when we are completely surrounded by a dangerous, alien nation. This is naturally going to result in major depression and post traumatic stress disorder in a lot of our white people. It might be epidemic! This will lead to a sudden rise in suicides, which will only deplete the white numbers and demographics all the more.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-406420" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Neither of the two posts above this one know squat about Lincoln or Lincolns war. Lincoln was the head of the society in Illinois to ship blacks to Africa or South America, before the war. During the war his administration continued the project, up until Lincoln was shot.<br/>
The war was started by Lincoln to keep the Union intact, and everyone in the North and South knew that fact. Halfway through the war Lincoln was not winning and he decided to &#8220;free&#8221; the blacks in hopes they would rise up in the South. Of course he could not &#8220;free&#8221; the blacks and the blacks did not rise up. Even in the areas the Union had invaded and occupied, the blacks were not freed by Lincoln.<br/>
When the word got out that Lincoln was going to &#8220;free&#8221; the slaves, there was much anger in the Northern ranks. The North was tired of the war and wanted no part of blacks taking their jobs after the war. NYC had riots so great that the army had to come in and put down the riot with force, many died.</p>

<p>Go look through history, you will find their hands in all of it, no matter what country or era you look at. Read books written by their fellow tribesman, you will learn alot about what they think of the &#8220;Goy&#8221; or &#8220;Gentiles&#8221;&hellip;</p>
