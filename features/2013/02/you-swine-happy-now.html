<div id="dsq-comment-message-195909" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>A simpler explanation is this:<br/>
Blacks are a population with an enormously elevated rate of paranoid schizophrenia. This is a dirty little secret that you will find hard to prise out of the psychriatric community, but it&rsquo;s a fact nevertheless. Couple this with the other predominant persnality traits of impulsiveness, bullying and aggression and you have an explosive cocktail, the psychological equivalent of fulminate of mercury. Just look at scenes of everyday life from any sub-Saharan African nation.<br/>
A subsidary point is that the modern education industry and I use that word industry deliberately, especially amngst the academic second raters of the so-called social &#8220;sciences&#8221; is basically just a a massive mutual masturabation society, a great big circle jerk (if the moderator and Amrenners forgive my langauge), in which second raters boost themselves in a status game, played with each other in showing off &#8216;who is lefter than thou&rsquo;. This is the way to gain kudos in the land of the perpetual Ivory Tower circle jerk, all you do is say something dumber and even more outrageous, call people who &#8216;don&rsquo;t understand you&rsquo; &#8216;stupid&rsquo; in true Hans Christian Anderson style and thus get digits on the Marxist tool and more strkes to rarified lefty nirvana.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-195988" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>That being said, I think Blacks and other non-whites are more likely to reject meds, so maybe that&rsquo;s the reason. Psychiatry and &#8220;Meds&#8221; are seen as rich white people stuff&hellip; they are also more distrustful of the medical community and less likely to seek help. So maybe they are just less medicated than whites.</p>
<p>I have been inside psych wards myself (I&rsquo;m bipolar) and the demographics are similar to prison- whites are a minority there, even in white areas.</p>

<p>I was remembering the unbelievable torrent of venomous hatred that was exploding out of the mouths of the liberals on TV, back during the GOP Convention when the cameras panned through the convention center and there was that sea of white faces in the audience. That seemed to trigger some kind of bizarre, uncontrollable, vitriolic hysteria out of the liberals on TV and they dropped their masks and began to spew massive amounts of raw, unfiltered race hate at the GOP and its &#8216;White base&rsquo;. Prior to 2012, I had never seen such an open, in our faces display of that sort - and I sensed that something had definitely changed in the minds of the Cultural Marxists who own and control our mainstream media. It seemed to me that the anti-White tirades were now being encouraged, whereas in the past, the media owners had a policy of keeping such outbursts toned down to a more subtle level.</p>
<p>No doubt about it. I believe that the word has come down from the top - and there is now a bright green light which lifts the restrictions that might have once served to temper minority hate whitey outbursts.</p>
<p>This is one of Jared&rsquo;s best and most provocative videos. Good job, Jared.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-197079" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Sorry, I have to disagree. Frankly, I am very disappointed in Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s use of the word &#8220;swine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jared Taylor is a hero of mine, a rare soul that has the courage to speak the truth in bold, unvarnished terms. However, one of the things that I always loved about Mr Taylor was his LACK of name calling and ad-hominem attacks. As he is often fond of saying &#8220;When you are reduced to name calling, that&rsquo;s the most graceless way of losing the argument.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes, I can understand why he used the word. Perhaps he&rsquo;s seen just one too many beautiful white women murdered senselessly and finally lost his patience. I don&rsquo;t blame him one bit. </p>
<p>But it still didn&rsquo;t seem right when I heard him utter the word &#8220;swine.&#8221; It reminded me of what Middle Eastern tribes do - call their enemies &#8220;pigs&#8221; and &#8220;dogs.&#8221; Far be it from me to criticize a man who has done SO MUCH for this movement. But I do hope that he remakes that video - or simply continues to refrain from name-calling in the future.</p>

But think of the articles you&rsquo;ve read and videos you&rsquo;ve watched by Jared. Has he ever even shown the slightest sign of impatience,even when dealing with the types of immaturity he&rsquo;s encountered on the Queen Latifah show or at the college seeking a white student organization this past summer?</p>
<p>If he calls some of the most vile people,with the most vile intentions,a name,just one time,I think it is simply saying that he has had enough and he truly despises them. It&rsquo;s not as if he just started ranting and swearing. It was one word with a direct recipient and it was meaningful as it was inspiring and provocative. </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t compare this to some trivial argument between some tribesmen that ends in a cacophonous burst of curses and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s enough to criticize. Wait until he&rsquo;s made a habit until you find fault in his words. He&rsquo;s a great teacher and we should really be taking lessons from this speech.</p>

<p>But something occurred to me today, or rather, a clever but sadly tragic way of putting our dilemma and our situation: Art Bell and George Noory get five hours a night on public airwaves to talk about space aliens, but Jared Taylor is lucky to get one hour a year on public airwaves to talk about illegal aliens. People bet a total of $100 million on the <i>COIN FLIP</i> outcome of the Super Bowl, not the game itself, but the coin flip before the game, but none of the same people would give $100 to the New Century Foundation to help save their own race.</p>

<p>And that is the terrible consequence of falling down in to conspiracy theory paranoia. You end up just confused about everything. Somethings aren&rsquo;t confusing, aren&rsquo;t complicated from our side - things like Black crime, Black welfare mothers haven&rsquo;t 8 bastard children, things like mass immigration of Central American Mestizos, Muslim throat cutters, rapists from Pakistan. </p>
<p>What happened to Detroit? In 1950 Detroit was a prosperous city with the highest per capita income of any city in the world. Now it&rsquo;s a third world hell whole. Are you confused about what happened to Detroit, think there is some super secret, sci fi conspiracy that has nothing to do with racial realities that took down the once safe, prosperous city of Detroit? </p>
<p>We need to be much more like mainstream Japanese people, mainstream Swiss people, Japan and Switzerland are safe, prosperous, very racially homogeneous countries. Swiss and Japanese people don&rsquo;t fall down in to paranoid, race denying conspiracy theory sci fi nonsense.</p>
<p>If you or anyone you support is falling down in to conspiracy theory paranoia, get help, get out.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-209600" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Great post. Conspiracy theory nonsense is one of the biggest things holding nationalism/racial back as a movement in America. As you note, it&rsquo;s not a big phenomenon on the nationalist right in Europe, which is far more successful. Conspiracy theories take the focus off of the real issues and waste effort in political dead ends. Conspiracy crap has been a recurring problem on the right in America for generations. </p>
<p>Stormfront has been overrun with conspiracy theory freaks over the last six years of so. These types seem to believe in racialism only as part of a general tendency to go against the official version of everything rather than for love for their own people or though logic. Many of these people appear mentally unwell. Way too many people on white nationalist internet sites want to wallow in despair or vent anger rather than find solutions.</p>
<p>Our movement should have a zero tolerance policy for people with defeatist attitudes or who believe in crazy nonsense about 9/11, the Masons etc.</p>

You know, like money grubbing, control of banking, media, movies, the concept that they work together to milk the Goyim, that they have no scruples, etc. etc. Is there another side to the coin or are they really innocent victims, as clean as the driven snow, who just happen by coincidence to attain these same stereotypes everywhere they go? Why is it the very same ethnocentrism and bigotry is not visited upon the Japanese diaspora or any of the other examples i could provide?</p>

For a balanced rather than chauvinistic, &#8220;lachrymose&#8221; or merely apologetic view of Jewish history, you could read Bernard Lazare, Norman Cantor, Albert Landemann, Avi Schlaim or Chaim Bermant (among others); I do not intend to do your work for you by putting long quotes and page references on this site and thereby making readers heartily sick of the subject and your tediously declared, blind &#8220;love&#8221; of all Jews (and Chinese).

The Jews are an ethnic group (perhaps more precisely a combination of four closely similar and related groups [see Richard Lynn, "The Chosen People" (Whitefish, MT 2011) ch.2]). So people see them and they see themselves as culturally different from other peoples, and this has caused some culture clash in different places and at different times (including the Middle East today). If Jews were no different from anyone else except in their average intelligence, we would not know who were Jews or who were not. You yourself note an ethnic difference when you suggest that Jews (not others) are entitled to own and occupy the land between the Mediterranean and the Euphrates.<br/>

The vast majority of whites in the US worked their own land, John, unlike the majority of jews whilst in Europe and unlike the jews in Israel who suck off the europeans in the US. If asking why the jews refuse to carry themselves makes me some kind of racist then perhaps I am. But there is no such thing as antisemitism. Resentment of jewish exploitativeness wasn&rsquo;t a pathology in europeans; entitlement was the problem in the jews. On occasion there occurred a two-way street, but remember that jews started calling european blonde women &#8216;abomination&rsquo; well before the Czars called them that back.

It is not just a matter of being a collection of clever individuals.</p>
<p>For a particular group to make a claim to a territory to the exclusion of other groups it must have some cultural or historical character different from that of others. The &#8220;Jewish&#8221; claim to &#8220;Israel&#8221; therefore must depend on an ethnic self-identification, which has nothing to do with IQ or moral behavior, whether this claim is justifiable or not.</p>
<p>Given that Jews are ethnically different from other groups, there is a prima facie possiblity that friction might arise between their ethnic behavior and that of others. It need not be due solely to envy of intelligence or legitimate achievements. What is called &#8220;antisemitism&#8221; has not been ended by the creation of the state of Israel, but seems now to have spread to other groups in its geographical area.</p>
<p>Now for the quite different point you make that White people have a weaker claim to live in and control the USA than Jewish people have to the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan (or Euphrates), perhaps you could expand on your criteria for occupation, including the dates.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-198487" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>These quotes answer your own question as to what distinguishes Jews from other people other than higher average intelligence.<br/>
Not all scripture scholars see in these ancient statements any justification for the Zionist occupation of Palestine from 1947-8 - not even those who take the Old Testament as literally true and divinely inspired; e.g. Stephen Sizer, &#8220;Zion&rsquo;s Christian Soldiers&#8221; (Nottingham IVP, 2010). Many Christians have taken the view that Jewish possession of Israel depended on fidelity to the Lord&rsquo;s commandments, and this ended with their rejection of the Messiah and the subsequent destruction of the Temple.<br/>
Personally I don&rsquo;t believe any of these stories about God actually &#8220;appearing&#8221; to Abram any more than I believe that God walked in the Garden of Eden or told Noah to build an Ark; and it is worth mentioning that many Jews inside and outside Israel do not believe these ancient tales either.<br/>
I do think the west should prevent the Israeli people from being killed by Arabs, but there is much more to the problems of the area.</p>

<p>Jews have experienced &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221; in many countries other than those run by Whites. It is not because of any superior jewish intellect, which is a myth, but it is often because jews frequently undermine and attack the foundations of non-jewish societies.</p>
<p>For example, Japanese or Chinese communities are not, and never have been, under threat from their White neighbors because of their higher average IQ. This is because these Far Easterners do not teach their children that their hosts are evil or subhuman, both of which many jews are taught from birth.</p>
<p>You keep asking for evidence, yet somehow never produce any yourself. So why not produce examples of Whites attacking jews because they think the jews are smarter?</p>

<p>- Adolf Hitler, from Mein Kampf,&#8221; Volume I, Chapter II, &#8220;Years of Study and Suffering&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, the intellectual abilities were schooled in the course of centuries. Today the Jew is looked upon as clever, and in a certain sense he has been so at all times.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Adolf Hitler, from &#8220;Mein Kampf,&#8221; Volume I, Chapter XI, &#8220;Nation and Race&#8221;</p>
<p>In &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221; Adolf Hitler makes it clear that he did not begin to hate the Jews until failing in his efforts to become an artist and an architect. Living in Vienna as he did at the time he saw plenty of Jews who had succeeded in both endeavors. Secular antisemitism is the politics of envy.</p>

I&rsquo;m a white Christian conservative gentile from a Red State - Indiana and I support Israel and the Jewish people. Based on documented evidence, the Jews are not only the smartest people on the planet but their contribution to science, technology, music, arts, medicine, religion/ theology and finance is priceless. Jews are an asset to any civilization, be it Austria-Hungary/ Prussia, Spain or even Persia. Despite period of progroms, persecution and forced deportation from some foreign lands, the rulers of those lands also had the good sense to invite such a talented ad intelligent race back to improve their economy.</p>
<p>Dislike or opposition to Jews/ Israel is a clear sign of envy and deep seated inferiority of their detractors. Whenever I see a bunch of low IQ muslims, blacks (Nation of Islam types) or white Neo Nazi retards attacking Jews, I see epic losers!</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-197285" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Nate,</p>
<p>Antisemitism is the politics of envy. </p>
<p>A book I recommend to you is &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution.&#8221; I learned about it here:</p>
<p><a href="/ar/2009/05/index.html#article1" rel="nofollow">/ar/2009/05/index.html#article1</a></p>
<p>A chapter in the book is entitled &#8220;Medieval Evolution: How the Ashkenazi Jews Got Their Smarts.&#8221; The argument is that for over a thousand years Jews in most of Europe faced religious discrimination. They were excluded from most trades and from owning land. Consequently they lived by commerce and money lending. These professions require superior intelligence, so Jews who could not learn the necessary skills left the faith, or did not have children. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, money lending did not win friends for the Jews, and perpetuated prejudice against them. People do not like to have to borrow money. They do not like to have to pay it back. Nevertheless, it is interesting that discrimination made Jews more intelligent. Many liberals blame discrimination for making blacks less intelligent. </p>
<p>A comparable selection process was happening in China. Brilliant young men who could pass the imperial exams entered the Scholar Gentry. They were expected to have several wives, and many children. Because they were well paid most of their children survived and reproduced. It did not matter if they came from humble origins. What mattered was passing the exams. </p>
<p>While this was happening, intelligent peasant boys in Europe entered the Roman Catholic priesthood and were forbidden to have any children at all.</p>
<p>For American Indians and Negroes in Africa fighting ability mattered more than intelligence. Hispanics are a hybrid race composed of whites, American Indians, and a few blacks. </p>
<p>These factors explain why Ashkenazi Jews tend to be more intelligent than Chinese, who tend to be more intelligent than white Gentiles, who tend to be more intelligent than Hispanics, who tend to be more intelligent than blacks. </p>
<p>What happened to the Ashkenazi Jews is now happening to the entire human species. Computer technology enables a small number of geniuses to amass vast fortunes. It enables individuals of superior intelligence to make good incomes. It reduces the economic value of jobs most people are able to learn. </p>
<p>I cannot claim to be benefiting from the process, but I recognize that it is happening.</p>

The involvement of Jews in the modern porn industry has been far from negligible (for example, the Golds in Britain), though the explanation is more likely an eye for profit than a conspiracy to corrupt Christendom.

And I say this as a white red blooded gentile who has dated Jewish girls in the past. I&rsquo;m now happily married to my white conservative mid western American wife of German ancestry. Would you call Jews like Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johannson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Bar Rafeli, Esti Ginzburg, Patricia Arquette, Goldie Hawn ( when she was young) &amp; Elizabeth Taylor unattractive?</p>
<p>Also, Israel has some of the most beautiful women I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Tel Aviv was voted in the top 10 cities for having the most beautiful women in the world. </p>

I personally think dark complexioned Mediterannean women from Italy, Spain, Portugal, Israel, Lebanon, Tunisia, Greece and Armenia are some of the most beautiful women in the world outscoring both blondes and red heads. Also, if what you state is true, than explain why quite a few white &amp; Jewish men including very wealthy, famous and good looking ones prefer Asian women ( &#8220;Asian Trophy wives&#8221;) over white women. </p>
<p>If you think a few ordinary white and some ordinary non white men fondling your red/ blonde hair makes you attractive than what can be said about extraordinarily wealthy, powerful, famous and good looking white &amp; Jewish men dating/ marrying Asian women? Even Jared Taylor had a Japanese lover when he was younger.</p>
<p>Some examples of white men-Asian women relationships include but are not limited to: Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook founder/ owner), Nicholas Cage, Rupert Murdoch (Media Mogul &amp; owner of Fox News/ 20th century Fox etc), Jean Todt ( CEO of Ferrari Auto), George Soros ( Powerful Businessman &amp; the &#8220;King maker&#8221; in American politics), British glam actor Hugh Grant, etc</p>

<p>Your comment reveals more about you than Jews. You have not and cannot document any of your assertions.</p>
<p>Jews have contributed to the United States from the beginning. This is what George Washington wrote to a Jewish congregation: &#8220;the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.</p>
<p>It would be inconsistent with the frankness of my character not to avow that I am pleased with your favorable opinion of my administration and fervent wishes for my felicity.</p>
<p>May the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants-while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid.</p>
<p>May the father of all mercies scatter light, and not darkness, upon our paths, and make us all in our several vocations useful here, and in His own due time and way everlastingly happy.</p>
<p>G. Washington<br/>

I have been unable to access Stormfront on through my previous providers/servers or my censored county library computer, and have had no particular wish to do so after getting through a few times out of recent curiosity. David Duke and David Irving are also locally censored, though a few recent inquiries there (e.g. the pornography issue) did turn up a few relevant important points. However, I prefer a more detached sociological analysis of Jewish-Gentile interactions, from classical antiquity to present times, and have learnt much from Jewish historians, including Roth, Poliakov, Lindemann, Katz, Muller, Cantor, Wistrich, etc, etc.<br/>
But I have other interests in what remains of my life.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-196271" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>By what criteria is Israel a mess? Israel is the only stable democracy in the Mid East.</p>
<p>This is what &#8220;The CIA World Factbook&#8221; has to say about Israel: &#8220;Israel has a technologically advanced market economy. Its major imports include crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Cut diamonds, high-technology equipment, and pharmaceuticals are among the leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable trade deficits, which are covered by tourism and other service exports, as well as significant foreign investment inflows. </p>
<p>&#8220;The global financial crisis of 2008-09 spurred a brief recession in Israel, but the country entered the crisis with solid fundamentals - following years of prudent fiscal policy and a resilient banking sector. The economy has recovered better than most advanced, comparably sized economies. In 2010, Israel formally acceded to the OECD. </p>
<p>&#8220;Israel&rsquo;s economy also has weathered the Arab Spring because strong trade ties outside the Middle East have insulated the economy from spillover effects. Natural gas fields discovered off Israel&rsquo;s coast during the past two years have brightened Israel&rsquo;s energy security outlook. The Leviathan field was one of the world&rsquo;s largest offshore natural gas finds this past decade, and production from the Tama field is expected to meet all of Israel&rsquo;s natural gas demand beginning mid-2013.&#8221;<br/>

Ask any Israeli traveling outside that country how hard it is to make a living there, and get an earful. </p>
<p>The economy is in the hands of criminal gangsters, and the body politic is increasingly in thrall to the ultra-Orthodox fanatics who ruthlessly haggle for more state subsidies while refusing to work or serve in the army. As their numbers grow, so too do their demands on the state.</p>
<p>If you ever go to Israel, (as I have) you&rsquo;d see up close and personal how unworkable a Jewish state is. It is just like the Soviet Union, another unworkable scheme that finally collapsed upon its own internal contradictions.</p>

<p>Ever heard of Goldman Sachs and the recent mortgage meltdown? Lloyd Blankfein? Bernie Madoff, the Jewish thief who the Jewish community turned on, only because he began ripping off fellow Jews?</p>
<p>Can you produce a White who has stolen as much?</p>
<p>&#8220;Antisemitism&#8221; is a problematic term, mostly because:</p>
<p>1) The overwhelming majority of &#8220;Jews&#8221; today are a genetic pot-pourri of people with very little, real Semitic DNA.</p>
<p>2) Several groups of people today exercise claims to Jewishness that would, by necessity, override the Jewishness of other groups (&#8220;Beta Israel&#8221; vs Yemini Jews vs Kaifeng &#8220;Jews&#8221;).</p>
<p>3) Jews have been at war with and hated the Arabs since they existed, meaning there is no point in time where Jews themselves have not been antisemitic.</p>
<p>4) The Jewish religion encourages antijaphetism and a general hatred toward non-Jews.</p>
<p>It is unfair and unjust for a group with high levels of insular practices to condemn other groups for having the same practices. Yet, this is what organized Jewry does the world over.</p>
<p>Before Jews complain about antisemitism, they should check their own antijaphetism and antigentilism.</p>

Read from the damned thing sometime. Ruth Buzzy Ginsberg, on the &#8220;court that looks like America&#8221; says that the &#8220;&hellip;Talmud is her daily guide to life.&#8221; or something to that effect. The propaganda machinery in the press and education ensures that the message of &#8220;our friends Israel&#8221; and rampant &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221; echo without decay throughout every aspect of American life. No one anywhere has ever suffered as a Jew suffers. Another enlightening read is &#8220;The Holocaust Industry&#8221; by Finkelstein. These people as a collective, hate American Christian culture as surely as blacks hate whites BUT they DO have the intelligence and forbearance to implement their own sort of social destruction in ways much more insidiously and therefore malignantly than the most violent hateful blacks.</p>
<p>Remember the Christian-hating Jewish supremacist Schneerson, who was actually reputed the be Christ by some, getting the Medal of Freedom?! This is the kind of inordinate political power these people wield by through calculating cliqueish insinuation into all organs of power by virtue of superior treachery genes. We eject Israeli spies with regularity from this country -far more than anyone else -even that other superior group -the Chinese.</p>

I respect other people&rsquo;s right to an opinion, but what liberal&rsquo;s have done to this country goes far beyond expressing an opinion. they are engineering the destruction of America by going after those in power, namely the White, heterosexual, Christian, males. And they have been successful because we have been trained to allow it.</p>

I do know that the Great Depression caused economic distress also to many ordinary Jews, some of whom then reinforced the ranks of the American Communist Party which was for them something of a natural home because of the earlier refugee influx from Russia. Some Gentiles who had believed the &#8220;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&#8221; - whose authenticity I have refuted in a previous post - saw in the Crash a fulfillment of a &#8220;prophecy&#8221; therein that Jews because of their control of gold would engineer an economic crisis that would send revolutionary workers onto the streets.<br/>
The interactive conflict between an international people and national peoples has indeed an ethnic dimension. Most Jews are still raised with strong ethnocentric attitudes, reinforced by Hitler&rsquo;s cruelly mistaken actions. Some of their leaders of opinion have shifted historically back and forth from &#8220;socialism&#8221; to &#8220;capitalism&#8221; to &#8220;socialism&#8221;; q.v. Jacques Attali, George Soros and many &#8220;neo-cons&#8221;. The ethnocentric Theodor Herzl wrote: &#8220;When we sink, we become a revolutionary proletariat&hellip;.when we rise, there rises also our terrible power of the purse&#8221; (&#8220;The Jewish State&#8221; [London 1934] p.26). Professor Norman Cantor writes: &#8220;Empirical data support the contention of French and German anti-Semites in the 1920s and 1930s that Jews were both capitalists and communists&hellip;.&#8221; (&#8220;The Sacred Chain: A History of the Jews&#8221; [NY 1995] pp.274-5).</p>

An answer about difference (other than average IQ between Jews and white Gentiles) in the form of a question for you to answer: what is the difference between an Israeli Zionist and everyone else? The answer is: ethnic identity. Most Jews (whether clever or stupid) are still raised to think of themselves as ethnically different from non-Jews. If you think they are mistaken, tell them why.</p>

<p> <a href="/ar/2009/05/index.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2009/05/index.html</a></p>
<p>Gregory Cochran and Harpending discuss those genetic defects in their explanation of the superior average intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews. </p>
<p>Their argument is that for about one thousand years after the fall of the Western Roman Empire Jews in most of Europe were discriminated against in ways that forced them to support themselves as money lenders and merchants. These professions require superior intelligence. Jews who could not learn the necessary skills left the faith or did not have children. </p>
<p>In addition, periodic pogroms forced Jews to live by their wits. </p>
<p>The Ashkenazi had to evolve superior intelligence very quickly. In the process they picked up some dangerous genes. The same genes that are dominance for superior intelligence are recessive for the genetic diseases.</p>

<p>That said, I agree with you about the historical imbalance in Christian-Jew persecution.

We know from Gibbon alone that Jews have been just as capable of atrocity as anyone else.</p>
<p>To broaden your own viewpoint, I suggest you read all the references to Jesus and his punishment in the Talmud, the Toldoth Yeshu, and also one of the rare Jewish historians of antisemitism who do adopt neither a self-righteous nor lachrymose viewpoint, such as Albert Landmann.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-201267" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Actually parts of an anti Pauline viewpoint survive in the New Testament.</p>
<p>The Gospel of St. Matthew 5:17 - 19, which was probably written after the death of St. Paul reads, &#8220;Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.&#8221; </p>
<p>This upholds the Law of Moses against St. Paul&rsquo;s assertion that most of it was unimportant.</p>
<p>The Epistle of St. James, which may have been written by St. James, the next oldest brother of Jesus and the first Bishop of Jerusalem reads 2:14, 17 &#8220;What doth it profit by vrethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith save him?&hellip;Even so faith, if it hath not works is dead, being along.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an obvious polemic against St. Paul&rsquo;s doctrine of justification by faith alone. </p>
<p>The Gospel of St. John has unfortunately been used by antisemites because Jesus opponents are not named as &#8220;scribes and pharisees,&#8221; but &#8220;the Jews.&#8221; The Gospel of St. John was the last Gospel to be written. It reflects a time when the division between Christianity and Judaism had become deeper.</p>

<p>1. &#8220;The fourth evangelist is spreading to the synagogues of his own time the blame that an earlier tradition placed on the authorities [not just a few scribes]. The oldest extant Christian writing speaks of &#8216;the Jews who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets&rsquo; (I Thessalonians 2.14-15). John and/or his confreres have been driven out of the synagogue for professing that Jesus in the Messiah (9.22, 12.42). Within a few decades there was introduced into synagogue prayer (Shemoneh Esreh) a curse against followers of Jesus. At the end of the first century, expulsion from the synagogue exposed Christians to Roman investigation and punishment, even death&hellip;[16.2]&#8220;. - Professor Raymond E. Brown (Papal Pontifical Commission, &#8220;A Crucified Christ in Holy Week&#8221; (1986), pp.62-63.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;Jesus is dealing a death blow to a claim that the Jew believed he was safe because he was a descendant of Abraham. They are seeking a way to kill him, precisely the opposite of what Abraham did (Genesis 18.1-8). When the Jews said to Jesus they were not the children of any adulterous union they meant they had never gone astray from God. There may have been something more personal: the Jews put it about that Mary had been unfaithful, that her paramour had been a Roman soldier&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real father of the Jews is the devil, characteristically a murderer. When the Jews and Jesus met, inevitably the false tried to destroy the true. By calling him a Samaritan they meant that he was a foe of Israel, a law breaker and a heretic. In the original Aramaic the word for Samaritan would be Shomeroni, a title for the prince of the devils. His answer was that, so far from being a servant of the devil, his one aim was to honor God, while the conduct of the Jews was a continual dishonoring of God.&#8221; - Professor William Barclay (Glasgow University), &#8220;The Gospel of John, Vol.2&#8243; (1975), pp.22-32.</p>

You are a multiracialist, who says he would prefer to live in Vietnam or Israel, but welcomes a multicultural USA, ZPG for &#8220;white Gentiles of European ancestry&#8221; plus their race crossing with others, Chinese ascendancy over the West, etc.<br/>
The only connections that I can see is that you regard the Jews as cleverer than the rest of us on the basis of IQ reports on this site and that you experienced violence by some black people. Otherwise you are a cuckoo in the wrong nest.

<p>In the United States there is too much of a taboo against criticizing blacks and against drawing attention to the environmental and economic costs of all immigration, especially Hispanic immigration.</p>
<p>American Renaissance is a website where a contrary view to the politically correct consensus can be expressed, and where forbidden facts can be posted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this website attracts a number of posters who are motivated by hostility toward anyone who is not a white Gentile of European ancestry. These are bad for the image of American Renaissance, and make it vulnerable to its enemies.</p>
<p>Also, there is a difference between recognizing that a large black population is a problem, and disliking a person simply because he happens to be black. </p>
<p>Many of the comments in the &#8220;Could the Next Pope Be Black? Ghanaian and Nigerian Cardinals Are Both Possible Replacements for the Pontiff&#8221; thread expressed hostility for all blacks regardless of personal qualities.</p>

<p>Maurice Clemmons (February 6, 1972 – December 1, 2009) was an American felon who was responsible for the November 29, 2009, murder of four police officers in Parkland, Washington.[1] After evading police for two days following the shooting, Clemmons was shot and killed by a police officer in Seattle.</p>

<p>Lawyers for accused cop killer plan to use insanity defense<br/>
By KOMO Staff Published: Feb 4, 2013 at 9:05 PM PST</p>
<p>SEATTLE   &mdash;   The lawyers for accused cop killer Christopher Monfort are planning an insanity defense for their client.</p>
<p>Monfort&rsquo;s lawyers filed their notice of intent in King County Court on Friday.</p>
<p>Monfort is accused of gunning down Seattle police officer Timothy Brenton as Brenton sat in his patrol car on Halloween night in 2009. He&rsquo;s also charged with the attempted murder of training officer Britt Sweeney.</p>
<p>In addition, Monfort is charged with first-degree arson in connection with the October 2009 fire-bombing of four Seattle police vehicles at a city maintenance yard.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege Monfort was attempting to wage a one-man war against the Seattle Police Department. He was shot by officers during his arrest and is now paralyzed below the waist and confined to a wheelchair.</p>
<p>King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg has said he will seek the death penalty if Monfort is convicted.</p>

<p>I find it very telling that both of those men killed white police in the Seattle area, one of the first cities in the country to promote anti-white &#8220;white privilege&#8221; propaganda in the public schools. Seattle is only 6.8% black and full of sheltered white liberal &#8220;academics&#8221; bemoaning their &#8220;white privilege&#8221; to each other in what seems like a perverse contest to &#8220;out-progressive&#8221; each other.

<p>If so, I also saw a clip of that show and Whoopi Goldberg was spewing all sorts of gleeful anticipation of Whites being reduced to minority status and she was sarcastically dropping not-so-subliminal innuendos that had a definite threatening tone to them about what was in store for &#8216;Whitey&rsquo;. Alongside Goldberg sat the resident liberal cast of smirking, virulently anti-white females of that certain alien tribe - Joyce Behar and Barbara Walters and these vile women were sporting huge smiles and they both were nodding their heads and beaming with excitement over the garbage that flowed from Whoopi&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>A few feet away, sat one or two White European women - who said nothing during the tirade by Goldberg, but I watched the expressions on their faces and thought I could see faint signs of apprehension briefly pass over them. Clearly, these women - whoever they were, were going through a slow revelation on the realities of race and neither of them seemed to see any humor in what Goldberg was saying.</p>

We wont forget who tried to feed us to the wolves in order to make a university/media career where they would have had none. This video motivates me to make another donation to this site. Taylor is also correct that the republicans are worthless cowards, they are only a half a degree better than those who are feeding us to the wolves. They watch it happen, but pretend it isn&rsquo;t happening, and again, they play this game of denial and pretend for their own gain. That wont be forgotten either!</p>

I don&rsquo;t think more and more white people are going to wake up until they are pushed balls to the wall. It&rsquo;s amazing that white people as a race have allowed ourselves to fall so low.</p>

There will be small white areas full of working white men and women rebuilding ONLY whites. Imagine that for paradise, there will be hardly any crime and a sense of community and above all, HONESTY. I know that there will be former libs, leftists, college professors, marxist whites that are clamoring for entry and for safety from the rape and cannibalism outside these areas. I can smell a lefty lib a mile away, I can tell them by their dress, shoes, even their accent and speech patterns. If I have any say they will NOT be allowed in. Let them live in the paradise they wanted. The only people I&rsquo;d be sorry for is their children, but they should have thought of that.

However, our less honest opponents will accuse us of racism and then bring in the Holocaust as its archetypal example, whether we like it or not. We can only go on appealing to the common-sense, fairness and experience of the reasonable majority which will also include some Jews and even thoughtful non-whites.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-198530" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Without investigating the forces and causes behind anti-white hatred, we flail around in blindness. Study the Israeli Lobby and tell me that white subjugation has not been *partially orchestrated* by zionists and by widespread jewish support of that movement even if much of it is de facto, and unwitting. The analogy is to be a Christian one must at the least believe that Jesus was divine, as opposed to just some historical personage or even martyr. To be a jew one must conceive of oneself as a separate people bound together by blood and an absolute imperative to side with jews against all others. That concept is inherent to the self-concept of judaism. It&rsquo;s not some caveat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to maintain diplomacy with &#8216;caucasian&rsquo; ethnicities on here for the sake of unity; I was ethnically cleansed as a young girl by southern italians. Abducted and molested by one at 14, and raped by one of his neighbors and ethnic clan by another at 19. They felt they could treat a redheaded female like this as in their eyes my red hair was unattractive after *hunting* me down to punish me for achieving academically and athletically over them, and for having a father who a) worked and b) didn&rsquo;t kill people for his living . They felt insecure in their own italian identity, for good reason as one was mafiosa and the other just a weak, self-loathing person and male and g*****. Because their ethnicity and that of the jews were in the whopping majority, there were not enough northwestern european males around to defend me. But I have demurred from elucidating this, even under fairly intense pressure from some of my own ethnicity&rsquo;s males to &#8216;prove&rsquo; my claims of being assaulted. I did not want to offend some of the mediterraneans who are not all hateful and cowardly. They are a group that as a whole also face discrimination and hate from the anti-white forces so I try to respect their feelings, as much as I can, even to my own discredit or detriment sometimes, all the while knowing if I had confronted some of my most ardent challengers I could have at least halted some of their anger towards me. I am truly committed to the cause of defending the rights of white people and to me that includes anyone who has to check the white box.</p>
<p>But the jews are compelled by their very creed to act as a nation or political entity at odds with any &#8216;other.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t judge them as individuals but I do by their own admitted value and resultant attitudes and behaviors.</p>

You&rsquo;d think that, if according to these Marxist professors that if we **incurable Whites<br/>
are incapable of being anything other than oppressors, no many how much we<br/>
apologize and promote own decline, that would be a good argument for separation<br/>
in itself, but then where ever we choose to separate ourselves too would still<br/>
no doubt be cause for jealousy.<br/>
**Genetic determinism perhaps? Does that go both ways?<br/>
Notice how these leftists use the worst parts of historical racism against us<br/>
such as<br/>
-The one drop rule, now one drop of black blood=black success, beauty or<br/>
intelligence.<br/>
-AA is just discrimination spun around 180 degrees.<br/>
-Being color blind, post racial or the nation of cowards challenge is all a<br/>
racial one way street, with the burden only being on Whites to take the high<br/>
road and close their eyes and minds to reality.<br/>
-Group discrimination is so casually used, such as if we say &ldquo;all blacks&rdquo; in<br/>
relation to anything we&rsquo;d supposedly ignorant, but how come Whites and White<br/>
privilege are often all so freely painted with the same broad brush when explaining<br/>
our group crimes, when not all blacks were slaves and not all Whites are<br/>
descended from slave owners?<br/>
-Or probably the most insidious left wing racist plot is of &#8216;reverse eugenics&rsquo;, where blacks and Whites are actively pushed into interbreeding as to eradicate the so called<br/>
inherent pathologies of both groups (one is amplified while the other<br/>
underplayed), so one loses its homogeneous cohesion, rare recessive<br/>
qualities and group power, while the lesser group gets the latter groups<br/>
genetic gains, all while paradoxically and supposedly proving that racial<br/>
differences don&rsquo;t exist (see the benefits of modern &lsquo;one drop rule&rsquo; above) as<br/>
White traits are now represented (albeit watered down) within the black<br/>
phenotype.<br/>
While this one way destructive transfer of attributes is infuriatingly sold as<br/>
being in the name of love and all being inclusive and proof that the racial<br/>
differences that it utilises in its own mechanism don&rsquo;t actually exist!! </p>
<p>The left uses hate repackaged as love to kill us.</p>
<p>These White Benedict Arnold&rsquo;s, or the &#8216;cool, with it Whites&rsquo; will never let us<br/>
escape or separate, as like all socialists that need the producers to pay the<br/>
bills that their superior ideas generate.<br/>
They get the accolades while we pay the check.</p>
<p>They (higher learning institutions and the mass media) think that by editing reality<br/>
so that we only see a cherry picked version where player X is always seen as<br/>
the good guy victim and player Y is always the oppressor that makes them good<br/>
people, because of their good intentions or noble reasoning.<br/>
But omission is still lying, if you covert the truth, you are a liar,<br/>
simple as that.<br/>
They are liars all of them, they lie to us all, they lie to each other as<br/>
casually as breathing ( their livelihoods are dependent on keeping these lies<br/>
alive), but worst of all they knowingly lie to themselves, but they don&rsquo;t stop<br/>
there, they broadcast and project their lies as facts for the world to see and<br/>
will hysterically scream at us for simply questioning the premise of their<br/>
lies.<br/>
The role of the guilty, shame filled, pride less provider is the role which has been socially engineered for us. But we&rsquo;re paying too great a price with our lives and is there an end date or statute of limitations on our guilt?</p>
<p>I live to see these people&rsquo;s illusions crumble.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-198603" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I completely agree, you&rsquo;d think that we were half as evil as the media and academia paints us that they&rsquo;d be dying to be rid of us.They don&rsquo;t like us and we don&rsquo;t want to be around them so it makes complete sense to mutually agree to separate, but then when has &#8216;good sense&rsquo; ever been a progressive attribute?<br/>
They could finally have their progressive utopia free from those evil racists who are supposedly responsible for all black failure, old age, cancer and the sun eventually burning out and we can have a place to call our own, while we get to sit back and watch the horror show that would unfold over the new border. </p>
<p>No they need us to be around to be their whipping boys and to have someone to point their fingers at, for without us, they&rsquo;d be the only Whites &#8216;left in the room&rsquo; to reap all the anti White hatred that they themselves have inflamed.<br/>
They wish us gone, but not to go intact with dignity to another place where we&rsquo;d no doubt thrive and besides separation would probably be seen as too humane &#8220;a let off&#8221; that is too devoid of torture for us.<br/>
No, they wish us gone in spirit and in voice, but while physically still remaining present. They want to en-prison us in our guilt and to make us into thought slaves, who are mere shells of our ancestor&rsquo;s former selves and who constantly feel indebted for crimes long past, yet who&rsquo;re full of gratitude for any opportunity to be taxed to alleviate some of the pain of our guilt.<br/>
From these professors point of view it&rsquo;s all about sacrificing someone else, so that someone else can go off to war, that someone else can pay the inflated taxes to subsidize minority programs, that someone else can give up their job to a diversity hire or a hb1 visa holder, that someone else can give up their college place so some brown face can grab the honors and that someone else can pay their blood reparations on the streets.<br/>
Unfortunately these Marxist professors will never shut up as long as it&rsquo;s someone else out there who pays the debt, be it with money or blood.</p>
<p>Can you imagine though, if a couple of your existing States were set up properly to succeed, to be completely autonomous, sovereign states with an independent authority. With all resources and infrastructures left intact, with a clean slate in terms of debt and with no trade boycotts, embargoes, or blockades. Can you imagine just how popular these White states would be for decent Whites to migrate to.<br/>
Of the 40% of Whites who voted for Hussein term 2, you&rsquo;d find a lot of them would be looking at moving too, as once the bulk of the 60% of conservative Whites who voted Republican moved on, leaving the harsh realities of a minority majority behind. I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;d also find not many of these Marxist progressives would be wanting to stay behind either as their racket is to feed off us like a vampire and who&rsquo;d actually be quite useless without the original host&rsquo;s body.<br/>
Let&rsquo;s face the facts, of that 40% and that 60%, we&rsquo;re all racists in the eyes of our enemies, either we&rsquo;re practicing or reformed, in denial or in touch, there&rsquo;s actual power in us embracing what we&rsquo;re trying to avoid being or what we know we are, it&rsquo;s a hard sell granted thanks to all the propaganda, but somehow we need to free ourselves of this burden.<br/>
On the White Nationalist&rsquo;s utopia, I can&rsquo;t ever see it being handed to us on a silver platter, that&rsquo;s the sort of freedom we&rsquo;d certainly have to fight for.<br/>
The establishment would never let us willingly leave because they need to feed off us and if we did somehow manage to escape and we forged new a homeland they&rsquo;d use direct force, negative propaganda, scare/fear tactics to stop other Whites joining us, then the UN would no doubt deem these new White states as a &#8216;crime against humanity&rsquo;, with the New United States military putting it&rsquo;s hand up to send in &#8216;peace keeping&rsquo; warships and gunships etc etc.<br/>
It doesn&rsquo;t mean that our vision of a homeland is impossible, it just isn&rsquo;t going to be easy, but variables are always changing, so maybe the wind will blow our way sometime soon and hopefully we&rsquo;ll be ready to take advantage of the opportunity when it does present itself.<br/>

<p>During the War in Vietnam the white left wanted black allies.</p>
<p>Moreover, the War in Vietnam distracted white liberals from drawing the conclusions they should have from the black ghetto riots and the rise in black crime that followed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the beginning of the war on poverty.</p>
<p>That was a long time ago. It is time for white liberals to wake up from Martin Luther King&rsquo;s dream and realize that things have not turned out as they hoped they would.</p>

<p>A white liberal with any insight should be able to realize that the black response to the civil rights legislation destroyed the New Deal Coalition that had enabled the Democratic Party to dominate the United States since the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.</p>
<p>During the late 1950s and early 1960s white racial moderates in the United States thought that by supporting civil rights legislation they were buying racial peace. What they got instead were five years of black ghetto rioting from 1964 to 1968, and more durable increases in black crime and illegitimacy. There was no discernible improvement in black academic achievement. Since the school year of 1986 - 87 the gap in average Scholastic Aptitude Test scores between white and black high school students has increased. </p>

<p>The ability of Tim Wise and the Southern Poverty Law Center to collect money remains mysterious to me. </p>
<p>You overestimate the appeal of political propaganda and indoctrination. It is only effective when it tells people what they want to believe, or what they feel to be true from personal experiences in their lives. </p>
<p>Whites continue to dominate education, the media, and think tanks. As individuals affirmative action policies worked against them as they achieved their careers.</p>
<p>I can understand why well educated white professionals would have liberal views on economic, environmental, and foreign policy issues as well as on abortion and gay rights. It is more difficult for me to understand why so many of them have not drawn logical conclusions from the disappointments of the civil rights movement. </p>
<p>Those disappointments lend credibility to arguments segregationists presented against the civil rights legislation before it was passed.</p>

<p>Those you call &#8220;cultural Marxists&#8221; would not have had the appeal they had without the War in Vietnam. The Vietnam was neither important to America&rsquo;s economy or security. The vast majority of the Vietnamese supported Ho Chi Minh. </p>
<p>A preposterous argument on one side of a dispute does not mean that the other side is correct. Nevertheless, arguments in support of the War in Vietnam were preposterous. They inclined many college students to agree with Herbert Marcuse.</p>

<p>The only answer I can think of is that affluent whites come into contact with few blacks. These few are exceptional, or they occupy subordinate positions without resentment.

<p>When blacks are in the minority most try to behave. When they are in the majority most behave the way they want to behave. Many do not want to behave well.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-201495" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I started at school with Communists (all Jews incidentally) and often engaged in debates with them and their parents. Our local CPGB treasurer Marks had &#8220;Daily Worker&#8221; back numbers hanging in his kitchen and Stalin portraits in his son&rsquo;s bedroom, while his wife worked for a Korean war &#8220;collaborators&#8221;. All my college tutors were leftists, one of them, Rosen, a well-known Communist. </p>
<p>I was been acquainted with Marxists of various stripes all through my years as a teacher/trade unionist in London and Norfolk, mostly &#8220;race, gender and class&#8221; activists since the mid-1970s. I have studied Marxism-Leninism and Communist techniques for years, and specialized in anti-Soviet research notably as a consultant for the Foreign Affairs Research Institute, Whitehall, meeting also many ex-Marxists and former victims of the ideology; and I have continued to read Marxist literature of all kinds in more recent years; sample titles on request. </p>
<p>You are splitting hairs (again) over defining &#8220;genuine&#8221; Marxists; I would include Gramsci, for example. Would you? The New Left, of course, shifted the class war towards the colonial/race/minority war, sometimes attacking Soviet bureaucracy while objectively assisting its foreign policy.</p>
<p>Its pseudo-egalitarian notions have traveled upwards - some leading politicians and bureaucrats in Britain and the EU were originally Marxists of some sort or other. The objectives of people like Marcuse are now being imposed downwards on the white working and middle class as &#8220;equality and diversity&#8221; legislation.</p>
<p>To counter your last two sentences with further explanation, and to save space here, I recommend the information summarized by Professor Robert G. Wesson, &#8220;Why Marxism?&#8221; (London: Temple Smith, 1976) pp.165-188.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-201752" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>David Ashton,</p>
<p>With your knowledge you should know that the white working class has never been considered by Marxists as their target. </p>
<p>When I was involved in the anti war movement against the War in Vietnam during the late 1960s and early 1970s I was aware that most white blue collar workers were moving from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. I viewed this movement with the ambivalence I have since then often felt about political issues, and movements. Part of me thought white blue collar workers had legitimate concerns about crime, and especially black crime, and that they had reason to dislike the often disruptive nature of anti war demonstrations. The other part viewed them negatively for not understanding that the Republican Party did not advance their economic interests.</p>
<p>I never considered myself to be a Marxist.</p>
<p>In the United States a television program and a movie articulated the condescending and to a degree contemptuous attitude that was felt by affluent, well educated liberals toward white blue collar workers.</p>
<p>The television program was &#8220;All in the Family.&#8221; &#8220;All in the Family&#8221; was broadcast from 1971 to 1979. Before I watched my first program I read about it in a publication that was probably published by the Worker Student Alliance. This was an offshoot of the Students for a Democratic Society which had broken into a number of factions, including the Weathermen. </p>
<p>By now the New Left was discovering the writings of Karl Marx. The article I read condemned the television program as an inaccurate caricature of white blue collar workers.</p>
<p>The main character of &#8220;All in the Family&#8221; was Archie Bunker, a shipping and receiving foreman living in New York city. Initially he was portrayed unfavorably as a stupid racist. As the program evolved he became a likable and well meaning buffoon. The audience was expected to find him comical, rather than evil. He would try to sound educated by using multi-syllable words, but he would use them incorrectly and he would mispronounce them.</p>
<p>The movie was entitled &#8220;Joe.&#8221; It was released in 1970. There is nothing likable about Joe. In addition to working in a factory, he is a foul mouthed adulterer who hates hippies and blacks. </p>
<p>&#8220;All in the Family&#8221; and &#8220;Joe&#8221; articulated the attitudes of affluent white liberal Democrats, not Marxists. Neither made any effort to understand why white blue collar workers were moving to the right.</p>

<p>I do not wish to get entangled in a purely semantic &#8220;debate&#8221;.</p>
<p>In brief crude summary, Marx regarded the urban proletariat as the principal agent of class struggle and the replacement of capitalism, though the workers needed ideological guidance to that end. Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Gramsci and Marcuse (among others) developed Marxism in various ways. The anti-colonial revolutions and the establishment of &#8220;socialism in one country&#8221; altered the situation, but the establishment of global communism remained the shared ultimate goal. </p>
<p>Both the Soviet Union and the independent New Left faced the fact (however explained) that the western working class, especially in the USA, was neither sufficiently immiserated nor ideologically inclined (because of bourgeois indoctrination through nationalism, religion and consumerism) to make the revolution, at any rate on their own. It was therefore necessary (among other actions) to neutralize or displace the bourgeois culture-controllers, enlist the black workers with recent experience of poverty and discrimination, utilize further the anti-imperialist struggle (Indo-China, South Africa, Latin America) and immigration from the ex-colonies,</p>
<p>push the female &#8220;equality&#8221; movement, and finally adopt the &#8220;minority&#8221; causes such as homosexuals and the disabled. Marxist groups including the old CP remnants and the SWP are involved in all this: see their websites and literature. </p>
<p>A long way from Marx and Engels maybe, but just as insidious.</p>

<p>Marxism was a minority persuasion on universities back then. It has virtually disappeared as a political movement now. Back then collegiate Marxists were inclined to idealize the white working class.</p>

<p>Organized open communist parties are small in number, but some communist ideas have spread widely through western academe in line with the advice of both Lenin and Gramsci. All kinds of protest issues (years after Vietnam) are kept going to a common purpose: abortion, gun-control, immigrant rights, black studies, tea-party vilification, higher taxes for welfare not defense, attacking &#8220;reactionary&#8221; churches, etc. </p>
<p>Communists of different social backgrounds and occupations still expect that a severe international economic crisis, affecting both whites and others, will put Marxism and revolution back on the map. Unemployment in Europe and the Middle East is a sign of hope for them.</p>
<p>As Spengler predicted, it no longer matters if the voice of Moscow ceases to dictate - the work goes on by itself. &#8220;The great danger is when class war and race war unite to finish off the white world.&#8221;</p>

It is better to prepare for the prospect of economic decline and race war, and to try to prevent these developments by intelligent national action, than to wait until things have gone too far, and the leftist mobs are back on the street in effective collusion with leftists in the media, universities and political institutions.<br/>
On my analysis of US events including &#8220;Cultural Marxism&#8221; since Vietnam, I refer simply to one easily available source, among many: Robert G. Wesson, &#8220;Why Marxism? The Continuing Success of a Failed Theory&#8221; (London: Temple Smith, 1976/Basic Books, USA), esp.pp.180-188. (You would probably agree with his opening remarks.)<br/>
US affairs are a matter for the US, but if asked I would oppose secession attempts for reasons given in previous posts.<br/>
As far as my own continent is concerned, I note a recent interview with the Director General of the International Red Cross that Europe should be ready for popular uprisings, especially among benefit claimants, because of food shortages, like those in north Africa.<br/>
&#8220;The fact that Europe is starting to look like the third world is not so surprising. Approximately 60 million people in the last 50 years immigrated mainly from the Arab world to Europe.&#8221;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-204205" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Karl Marx recognized that the natural tendency of unregulated capitalism was to build wealth while reducing the standard of living for most people. He also realized that unregulated capitalism was destined to experience increasingly destructive economic downturns. This is what did happen, and culminated in the Great Depression. </p>
<p>The policies of John Maynard Keynes counteracted these tendencies. The Great Depression was ended by high government spending and employment paid for by high taxes on the rich. That is how &#8220;leftist mobs&#8221; were placated in the United States. </p>
<p>As Keynesian economic policies have been reversed the tendencies Marx recognized are again becoming evident. </p>
<p>Karl Marx was mistaken in arguing that class loyalties were stronger than loyalties of race and nation. That is why in the United States most white blue collar workers who are angry about declining living standards would rather direct that anger at non whites than the white plutocracy which is getting richer as most Americans are getting poorer.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-201424" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think it is interesting that a lot of posters on this website conflate white liberals with the white upper class. </p>
<p>What is really happening in the United States is that our economy is evolving in ways that place ever more importance on superior intelligence, and less importance on race and sex. </p>
<p>In the 1950s a white man with no education past high school, and perhaps not even a high school degree and an IQ of about 85 could have gotten a factory job with a strong union that would have won for him a lower middle class income, good benefits, and the ability to support a wife who did not need to work. He might even have been able to buy a house in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Now that is not possible. Nevertheless that man&rsquo;s sons, who are on the losing side of the income divide, would rather blame their declining living standards on a liberal elite than acknowledge that in an increasingly competitive economy they have little of value to offer an employer. They do not want to be told that a white plutocracy with the assistance of the Republican Party is getting richer at their expense.</p>

<p>The point I am making is that I do not see why there is a continued market for white guilt. During the 1960s and before one could plausibly argue that black poverty, crime, low average intelligence, and so on were caused by white racism. By now it should be obvious that blacks are responsible for their own problems and that most of them are unwilling or unable to take advantage of the opportunities that have been opened to them. </p>
<p>Also, during the late 1960s and early 1970s the white left was primarily concerned with the War in Vietnam and looked for black allies. That was a long time ago. By now it should be obvious that the black race in the United States has been a political burden to the left, and that race wrecked liberalism.</p>
<p>During the 1960s liberal Democrats went out on a limb to help the blacks. Blacks cut off the limb. When class is the issue Democrats win elections. When race is the issue Republicans win.</p>

It includes white guilt and nonwhite resentment.  It could be described as a death drive (a term from psychology) turned inward by whites and turned outward towards whites by nonwhites.  As a white, I am less concerned about trying to &#8220;cure&#8221; nonwhites than about trying to get whites to defend themselves at the group level for a change.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this what Jared Taylor does, teach whites  to hate blacks, under the guise of revealing truth?</p>
<p>I suppose, from an AmRen point of view, black have been killing whites when they get the chance for hundreds of years now, while Jared Taylor is shrugged off and silenced. Potentially, Jared Taylor could incite whites to  mayhem and murder. Then again, I suppose if someone were aroused to even say bad words about people of color this would be taken more seriously  that actions taken against whites.</p>

The problem is DNA, environment, culture, single-family homes and testosterone. Poor women do not commit that many crimes do they? Blacks males commit murder, rape and robberies at astronomical rates. All countries have some form of poverty but no matter where you go in the world, every black dominated country, or city has extraordinary crime rates that defy any other factor. Japan has poverty, but one of the lowest crime rates in the first world..  As for DNA and heredity look at studies of twins separated at birth, reunited, and found to have startling similarities in behavior. Do research and find out how many felons came from single family homes. Your points are strictly emotional.</p>

There is nothing in the genetic make-up of any person, black or white, that makes them more likely to become a criminal.  The way a person&rsquo;s life turns out is entirely due to environmental factors.  The ideas you have are like the ideas the Nazis put forward to justify their persecution of Jewish people.  There is no scientific basis for these ideas at all.  Genetically there is actually very little difference between the races.  In fact, we probably all have some DNA in us from every race on the planet.</p>

<p>Casmine Aska, Bronx teen accused of throwing boy, 9, off roof, says he &#8220;slipped&#8221;<br/>
ByCrimesider StaffTopicsDaily Blotter</p>
<p>&#8220;Casmine Aska, above, is charged with attempted murder after allegedly throwing Freddy Martin, 9, off a roof in the Bronx on Friday, Feb. 1, 2013. /CBS New York(CBS) NEW YORK - Casmine Aska, a teenager accused of throwing a 9-year-old boy from a rooftop in the Bronx, claims that he slipped and dropped the boy by accident,CBS New York reports.<br/>
Aska, 17, is charged with second-degree attempted murder. Police say he hurled 9-year-old Freddy Martin off the roof of a five-story building in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx Friday night.<br/>
A police report said Aska told investigators he grabbed Freddy by the legs while on the rooftop around 8:30p.m. Friday. Aska said he slipped and the boy fell five stories, according to CBS New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Police say Aska did not call 911 and did not tell his mother, the station reports.<br/>
Freddy was taken to New York Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center where he was listed in critical condition, police say. As of late Sunday night, he was in a medically-induced coma.<br/>
The fourth grader lives with his parents and grandparents in the five-story building, CBS radio affiliate 1010 WINS reports. The suspect is his neighbor in the building; one lived on the fourth floor, the other on the third.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a &#8220;Christian&#8221; Zionist&hellip;you and your tele-evangelist buddies are complete frauds and worship the big lie&hellip;truth is not in you.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;Judeo-Christian&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t even come into existence until after the Second World War when Jews became supreme in their influence over major media.</p>
<p>The truth is that there is no such thing as Judeo-Christianity. That would be like saying Satanic-Christianity. The religion now called Judaism did not even come formally into existence until six hundred years after Jesus Christ. It began with the codification of the Babylonian Talmud. In Judaism, the Talmud is the supreme scripture, not the Old Testament. Only Satanism can rival Judaism&rsquo;s vicious hatred for Jesus Christ. The Talmud even claims that Jesus Christ is being punished in hell by &ldquo;being boiled in hot semen!&rdquo;1</p>
<p>Really,what kind of a christian would support  the killings of other Christians and get giddy like a demon on l.s.d. when other Christians post get deleted because according to your rabbinic  moderator the post are anti-semetic&hellip;You Jews Happy Now? har har har</p>

<p>If you so desire to have an all white/ all European religion, then you are better off rejecting Christianity and instead adopting a more indigenous European religion like Witchcraft, Odinism, Teutonism, Asatru &amp; Hellinic paganism. Christianity was, is and will always be a part of the Jewish culture.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-197503" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thank you for making these videos Jared. They have all been great so far, and this one is no exception. </p>
<p>Although we do not have quite the same examples here in Britain, and perhaps not the same degree of hatred, there is without doubt a similar kind of attitude towards whites by the media and the liberal-elites in institutions and academia.</p>
<p>Where you have your sucker punches and flash mobs, we have had our &#8220;pack attacks&#8221;. When white women are targeted over there for rape and abuse, the same happens here with many Blacks, not to mention the &#8216;grooming&rsquo; issue of young teenage whites. </p>
<p>Where you have your anti-white media pundits, we have ours like Yasmin Alibhai Brown and the likes of many a BBC presenter. We cannot often get our issues discussed in academia or &#8216;debating societies&rsquo; either - as the institutions recoil in horror and abuse at us even thinking we should be able to have rights or a say in how society develops. </p>
<p>I am sure that on a certain level, all formerly &#8216;white&rsquo; homogeneous nations are under the same conditions of control and subversion. The examples cited in the video are quite stark and makes the point excellently. </p>
<p>As is said, it is not only blacks who imbibe this attitude - but general white society itself. It trickles down into wider society, which explains the &#8216;white guilt&rsquo; phenomena of liberals, who see no value in their own race and become horrified at the robust defence of it by others. </p>
<p>So yes, whilst it is naturally &#8220;American-centric&#8221; this situation plays out to various levels of potency around the &#8216;white world&rsquo;. </p>
<p>It is fantastic that Jared turns the tables, exposes their game and the effect it has. Stick these &#8220;swine&#8221; on the receiving end of some justified self righteousness by us. They are the haters, they are the evil doers, they DO have blood on their hands and have caused much wider misery and problems with their endless meddling and social engineering. </p>
<p>This is the way to do it, in my opinion. Thanks again Jared.</p>

It is time for all of us to pledge our lives, fortune, and our sacred honor to this, our country, founded on the courage and undying fealty to a concept which stood for a celebration of the human spirit  unshackled by tired serfdom and monarchy. Please do not misinterpret  what I am saying. This country is not a propositional nation. This country was founded by a group of extraordinarily gifted and brilliant White men. I for one, do not believe in coincidence. I believe that these gifted men were in fact brought together by divine providence, at exactly the same time. Scoff, if you wish. We have never seen the likes of these since.  I believe the existing federal government has crossed the line. They are officially tyrannical. I said before that I didn&rsquo;t really care what the name of our new third party should be. Now, I&rsquo;m thinking: MOLON LABE, SWINE.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-198087" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Congratulations to Jared Taylor on a powerful presentation. I agree with the message completely, especially the sentiment that these faux-liberal, anti-white academics have blood on their hands. I wonder if there is a litigious answer to this institutionalized wickedness. If it could be reasonably established that the murderer was influenced by anti-white college professors then they could surely be sued or prosecuted for inciting violence. Such a prosecution might make the others think a bit. </p>
<p>There are similar faux-liberal academics in Britain. I would take this opportunity to name and shame Richard Garcide of the &#8216;Centre of Crime and Justice Studies&rsquo; at King&rsquo;s College London,  who (when police statistics showed that blacks in London commit strikingly disproportionate levels of violent crime) blamed it on Britain&rsquo;s &#8216;history of Racism and Imperialism&rsquo;. He also made unfounded insinuations about the police. This is a classic example of an irrational apologist projecting black guilt onto whites. His shameful and stupid remarks can be found in a Daily Mail article entitled &#8220;Black men &#8216;to blame for most violent crime&rsquo; but they&rsquo;re also the victims&#8221;&hellip;</p>

<p>any thug who randomly smashes a citizen&rsquo;s face to that degree should be given the harshest of penalties, and i would actually suggest hanging. you cannot accidentally haymaker a random person in the face and it is not a youthful mistake of course. such a criminal can never useful to us.</p>
<p>but a black or any minority who does this to punish whites specifically, who perpetuates this game culture, indoctrinating further cretins to follow suit&hellip;should certainly be hung. .</p>
<p>clearly many modern people would consider that extreme. but i suspect many people do not understand the severity of attacks like these, thinking because no weapon is involved the victim will perhaps just have some tweety birds flying round their heads.<br/>
but unlike in movies, when people get hit like that, flush in the face, bare knuckle haymakers, you will often see smashed jaws which need humpty-dumptying back to together, smashed teeth, mutilation essentially, along with risk of brain damage or death. they give cat-scans to boxers who get knocked out and these guys wear gloves and can take a punch.</p>
<p>can you imagine this &#8221;game&#8221; happening in an iron age european community? can you imagine these people allowing especially the weak, frail in their population to be part of this &#8221;game&#8221;?</p>
<p>instead of the &#8221;ethnic guest&#8221; perpetrators of this game being sheltered by some PC culture, they would be hunted down and sent a message, a very reverberating message.</p>
<p>even in modern times, i just can&rsquo;t see this happening in china for instance. the government response towards these gangs would be beyond brutal. and even the blacks would learn.  </p>
<p>violence during mugging, sexual assault is bad enough obviously. but those involve the satisfaction of greed and sex, of primal urges. this is something different, actually more disgusting in its substance in some ways. this is a population of degenerates toying with us. knowing they can get away with it, not a glimmer of fear in their eye. </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s both sickening and an utter embarrassment for modern european populations, showing just how weak our societies have become. our citizens at risk of being skittles for some sniggering, swaggering african gangs when in theory we have the power to yoke that whole continent by the year&rsquo;s end if we chose.</p>
<p>footage of this &#8221;game&#8221; needs to be spread amongst white peoples. black gang warfare is excused via economics, muggings via drugs and 1st world &#8221;poverty&#8221;. and muslim attacks are excused with religion and evil whitey intervention. but this to me is much harder to excuse by any of the usual suspects. there is absolutely no gain for these blacks except pure sadism. and in that regard it makes it a powerful wake up tool.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-200674" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I found what Taylor had to say here disturbing not for what he said but for what he left unsaid.  Where is the outrage over an event like this?  This clip amounts to little more than an intellectual &#8220;what did you expect&#8221; from such inflammatory anti-white rhetoric.  Missing is any real sense that such rhetoric was an outrageous falsehood&hellip;.a direct attack on whites and an attempt to provoke violence (which has happened) and that such is not only wicked&hellip;but a legitimate provocation of a backlash.</p>
<p>It is this complete and utter failure to even whisper privately of a backlash that is the real root of the violence, actually.  Everyone with any real experience with blacks understands that all this rather thin complaint over past wrongs by whites is so much hogwash that the average black doesn&rsquo;t bother to examine in any depth whatsoever.  It is, literally, besides the point.  What they want are safe victims.  Not victims, mind you but SAFE victims.  Examine any group of blacks, any background, any time in history, any country they habitate and you will plainly see this as the principle motivating force behind their behavior&hellip;&hellip;the available of SAFE victims&hellip;.ones who can&rsquo;t or simply won&rsquo;t fight back.  Better if they won&rsquo;t even say anything about it as a group.</p>
<p>The left is supplying the, mostly unnecessary excuses for violence.  But what TAYLOR is supplying, in the way he responds is the safety factor by taking an almost absurdly neutral stance in how he explains this.</p>
<p>White people are going to have to accept something important about the situation (or die).  Violence and lots of it are a necessary response.  ONLY to the extent we are no longer safe to victimize is this situation going to be resolved.  I am tempted to say simply, shut the hell up and pick up a gun, except, I guess, someone has to attempt to counter the media whitewash on the situation.  And 65 million people this year did as I suggest and picked up a gun.  A good start.</p>
<p>But understand this.  They knew what was necessary DESPITE what people like Taylor had to say, not because of it.</p>
<p>We need better than this&hellip;&hellip;if we wish to live through the next few situations.  Because I am not suggesting that such things are necessary or even important.  I am saying that either we change in this way or we are finished as a race&hellip;no, not a hundred years from now but perhaps a decade from now&hellip;depending on how events unfold today&hellip;..THIS year.</p>
<p>Pick up a gun and don&rsquo;t put it down.  If you allow it.  I mean if YOU personally allow it, first there will be registration, then confiscation, then abuse&hellip;.and finally extermination.  DO NOT FORGET WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SOVIET UNION.  That isn&rsquo;t just possible here&hellip;..it&rsquo;s unfolding right before our eyes.  Nobody is sounding the alarm but at least it seems that on some visceral level, our people are not as suicidally stupid and cowardly as the soviets were.</p>
<p>Such things should be overt and shouted from every pundit, however&hellip;.not left unsaid and subconscious.  That is extremely dangerous.</p>
