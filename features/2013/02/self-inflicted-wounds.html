Discrimination against whites by whites.</div> 
</div> 


<p><i>Wounds That Will Not Heal</i>, by Princeton lecturer Russell Nieli, is a collection of the most powerful attacks on racial preferences likely to be found in a book by a mainstream publisher. It even touches on the inherent tribalism of man, the possibility of race differences in IQ, and the folly of thinking &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is a strength. <i>Wounds That Will Not Heal </i>makes a few silly brotherhood-of-man concessions to liberalism, but the book is an important part of the fight against &ldquo;affirmative action,&rdquo; particularly in universities.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Wounds.jpg?208409"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103052" alt="Wounds" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Wounds.jpg?208409" width="317" height="475"/></a></p>
<p>Preferences have sordid origins. How the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was supposed to ban race discrimination, was turned into a justification for discrimination against whites, is one of the most notorious legal-judicial perversions in American history. Mr. Niele notes that this was exactly what Southern opponents of the law predicted. However the law was worded, and no matter what its supporters promised, those old &ldquo;racists&rdquo; knew that the law would end in quotas.</p>
<p>And, as Mr. Niele writes, liberals have always been dishonest about what they were doing. Euphemisms such as &ldquo;affirmative action,&rdquo; &ldquo;goals and timetables,&rdquo; and &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; go over better than &ldquo;racial preferences&rdquo; or &ldquo;discrimination against whites.&rdquo; Mr. Niele also points out that the initial justification for preferences &mdash; compensation for those who had suffered most from discrimination &mdash; was always a fraud. Almost all beneficiaries have been middle-class blacks. And ever since the 1978 US Supreme Court <i>Bakke</i> decision, compensation has taken a back seat to the idea that &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is so desirable that it justifies discriminating against whites.</p>
<p><strong>Civil rights or special treatment?</strong></p>
<p>Blacks, of course, welcomed preferences, though Mr. Niele is naive enough to be surprised by that. He recognizes that the civil-rights bargain required people of all races to renounce tribal loyalty, and he thought blacks would do their part. He says that since so many black leaders were ministers, they &ldquo;would never stand for&rdquo; the idea of special treatment. He quotes the usual Martin Luther King guff about &ldquo;content of their character,&rdquo; and thinks that after King&rsquo;s death blacks somehow became more tribal.</p>
<p>This only proves that those &ldquo;racist&rdquo; Southern congressmen understood blacks better than a Princeton lecturer does. When blacks did not have equal rights they clamored for equality. As soon as they had equality they clamored for special treatment. Both appeals were tribal.</p>
<p>King, himself, made no secret of what he wanted. &ldquo;[I]f a city has a 30 percent Negro population,&rdquo; he reasoned, &ldquo;then it is logical to assume that Negroes should have at least 30 percent of the jobs in any particular company, and jobs in all categories rather than only in menial areas.&rdquo; King also wanted reparations for slavery. &ldquo;No amount of gold could provide an adequate compensation for the exploitation and humiliation of the Negro in America down through the centuries,&rdquo; he wrote, but he would accept &ldquo;a massive program by the government of special, compensatory measures which could be regarded as a settlement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is exactly what <i>Wounds That Will Not Heal</i> opposes on every page, yet Mr. Niele incongruously dedicated his book to King, &ldquo;who spoke to our common humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Niele may be blind about King, but he has no illusions about King&rsquo;s successors. He points out that &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; comes from the Latin <i>civilis</i>, meaning of or belonging to citizens. Since civil rights are common to citizens, &ldquo;to speak of the NAACP or La Raza as &lsquo;a civil rights group&rsquo; is a sign of moral and spiritual confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>White attitudes</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Nieli writes that for blacks and Hispanics (henceforth, B&H), preferences mean swag for the tribe. But what&rsquo;s in it for whites? Mr. Niele has clearly pondered this mystery, and writes that the impulse to support preferences probably comes from growing up middle class and then feeling guilty after discovering there are poor people in the world. He says this can sometimes lead to public-spirited acts, but that the white preferences supporter suffers from:</p>
<blockquote><p>a kind of demonic self-righteousness and hypocrisy, which induces him to try to expiate his own sense of guilt, not by giving up any of his own wealth or privilege . . . but by using government power to force other people, usually people considerably less well off than himself, to sacrifice <i>their</i> jobs, <i>their</i> lives, and <i>their</i> promotion entitlements.</p></blockquote>
<p>These are the whites who fawn on &ldquo;black people, whose disapproval the white &lsquo;liberal&rsquo; fears with an intensity bordering on horror.&rdquo; These whites also romanticize poor blacks, &ldquo;endowing them with a kind of secular holiness.&rdquo; Poor whites, on the other hand, are &ldquo;moral inferiors&rdquo; if they dare complain about discrimination against them. Mr. Niele suspects that well-off liberals like it when lower-order whites complain because it &ldquo;reinforce[s] and confirm[s] their own sense of moral and social superiority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Mr. Niele, liberal race thinking is &ldquo;ultimately narcissistic and self-preoccupied.&rdquo; It assumes that B&H can hardly move a muscle without white benevolence, and that even if preferences sometimes harm beneficiaries by setting them up for failure, that doesn&rsquo;t matter because what liberals care about most is self righteousness.</p>
<p>It is rare for a mainstream author to write so cuttingly and incisively about the motives of liberals, and it certainly took courage to denounce the thinking that no doubt prevails at Mr. Niele&rsquo;s own university. He is also refreshingly &mdash; and boldly &mdash; angry about the unfairness of preferences, writing about &ldquo;my own ethnic rage at affirmative action.&rdquo; According to orthodox thinking, only non-whites are entitled to &ldquo;ethnic rage;&rdquo; anything whites ever feel is mean-spirited &ldquo;resentment&rdquo; over loss of &ldquo;privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Blacks.jpg?208409"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-103054" alt="Blacks" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Blacks.jpg?208409" width="495" height="330"/></a></p>
<p>Mr. Niele is surprised that whites have not risen up in fury against systematic discrimination against themselves. Instead, they have been cowed by a ruling class that seems to have accepted the idea of &ldquo;collective and congenital blood guilt.&rdquo; He finds it &ldquo;truly alarming&rdquo; that such a concept could have taken root in America.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>River</em> books</strong></p>
<p>A large part of <i>Wounds That Will Not Heal</i> is devoted to taking apart three books that were funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support racial preferences. The best known of this &ldquo;river&rdquo; series is <i>The Shape of the River</i>, published in 1998 by William Bowen and Derek Bok, who have been, respectively, presidents of Princeton and Harvard. It was followed by <i>The Source of the River</i> in 2003<i>, </i>and<i> Taming the River</i> in 2009, also by Mellon-supported authors.</p>
<p><i>The Shape of the River</i> purported to follow the careers of Ivy-League affirmative-action babies and show how marvelously everything turned out for them &mdash; and for America. The two others used lengthy student questionnaires to try to prove the same thing. Mr. Niele says the authors are &ldquo;passionately, even desperately&rdquo; committed to preferences, and that their books reflect &ldquo;the extreme ideological one-sidedness that dominates academic sociology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <em>River</em> authors admit that preferences mean lower standards. They also admit that elite schools lie about this, but wish only that administrators lied more convincingly. They think it is a pity that B&H &mdash; who know they are less qualified &mdash; can&rsquo;t be persuaded they are just as qualified as whites.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RiverShape.gif?208409"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103055" alt="RiverShape" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RiverShape.gif?208409" width="300" height="443"/></a></p>
<p>The authors are also dismayed to find that beneficiaries think whites and Asians are smarter and harder working than they are, and that whites and Asians think so too. Blacks are hardest on themselves, and rank themselves as even lazier than whites and Asians do. The authors then lament the power of &ldquo;negative stereotypes&rdquo;!</p>
<p>We also learn from the <em>River</em> books that although foreign-born blacks are just 13 percent of the black college-age population, they are 40 percent of the blacks at the top schools, and that black women outnumber black men almost two to one at these schools. Asians have lower self esteem than other students, and although affirmative-action blacks at top schools do not lack for self esteem, the ones who go to black schools have even more.</p>
<p>The authors also write at length about how we must make up for the horrific obstacles ghetto blacks face &mdash; while failing to point out that affirmative-action babies are almost invariably middle class. The authors also describe racial segregation as a crippling condition for blacks, but do not mention that it never held back Chinese students or boat people. The <em>River</em> authors agonize over the mental Calvary of being a minority but don&rsquo;t seem to have noticed that Asians are a minority, too.</p>
<p>In short, Mr. Niele thinks the books are thoroughly mendacious. He also scoffs at the authors for what they left out of their questionnaires. They never asked blacks and Hispanics what <i>they</i> thought of affirmative action, no doubt for &ldquo;fear of what the answers might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Arguments against</strong></p>
<p>For years, &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; dared oppose preferences only because they threw beneficiaries in over their heads or &ldquo;devalued the accomplishments&rdquo; of competent B&H. Mr. Niele gets it right: Preferences are wrong because they are crushingly unfair to whites. He is furious that blacks with SAT scores of 950 to 1050 have a better chance of getting into the University of Virginia than whites with scores of 1350 to 1450 &mdash; and he is furious that it took a Freedom of Information request to find this out.</p>
<p>In Mr. Niele&rsquo;s view, racial discrimination is simply worse than other kinds of discrimination. He notes that after both world wars, veterans&rsquo; preferences bills passed overwhelmingly in Congress. Very few people thought they were wrong, and no one had to pretend they were anything but preferential treatment.</p>
<div id="attachment_103056" style="width: 419px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/WWIIVet.jpg?208409"><img class=" wp-image-103056 " alt="WWII veteran taking an aptitude test in an office dedicated to veteran employment." src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/WWIIVet.jpg?208409" width="409" height="331"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WWII veteran taking an aptitude test in an office dedicated to employing veterans.</p></div>
<p>Mr. Niele still argues that preferences are bad for the beneficiaries. At elite schools, everyone knows some students don&rsquo;t belong and got in because of race. Mr. Niele therefore thinks &ldquo;racial-preference policies serve to heighten rather than reduce racist ideas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;strengthen the belief in black inferiority.&rdquo; This could be true for students, who famously avoid black lab partners, but preferences may fool the rest of the country. It would send a very clear message if Harvard and Yale admitted strictly on ability and had no black students at all.</p>
<p>It is fashionable to worry that there are not enough non-white scientists and graduate students, and Mr. Niele thinks race preferences are part of the problem. He says B&H are more likely to switch out of science majors than whites and Asians, and that this is because they are at schools where the work is too hard for them and they get bad grades. If they had got better grades at lesser schools they might have stayed in science or gone to graduate school.</p>
<p>Mr. Niele quotes the well-known work of Richard Sander, who, with great difficulty, pried admissions data out of law schools. He found that blacks are two full standard deviations behind whites in qualifications and performance, and are twice as likely to drop out, fail, and flunk the bar exam. Prof. Sander thinks that if black law students were better matched to their schools, they would not fall behind, would stay in school, and be more likely to pass the bar exam. In other words, preferences <i>reduce</i> the number of black lawyers.</p>
<p>There are only a few studies that have tried to measure the benefits of &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; Mr. Niele cites one that concluded that the more ruthless the racial preferences, the more they seem to erode academic standards for all students. Another study found that white students do not like preferences, faculty dislike them somewhat less, but administrators claim to like them.</p>
<p>Mr. Niele concludes: &ldquo;It is difficult to see how more intellectually substandard black and Latino students on college campuses improve race relations, enrich the learning environment for the whites and Asians, or improve the image of blacks and Latinos in the minds of classmates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is common to argue that since B&H know there are systematic preferences, they know they can afford to slough off. John McWhorter of the Manhattan Institute, for example, says he did not work hard in high school because he knew he could breeze into a good school because he is black. Mr. Niele supports this view by pointing out that blacks do worse in school than their test scores suggest they should. Their grades are not as good as those of whites who get the same test scores, and the tougher the school, the wider the gap.</p>
<p>In fact, many blacks &mdash; even beneficiaries of blatant preferences &mdash; think society is out to oppress them, so they may not be counting on white largess to make up for laziness. Mr. Niele does not consider the possibility that there could be average racial differences in behavior. A black and a white who get the same SAT score may have the same intelligence, but blacks are less able to defer gratification. This could mean they are more likely to goof off than study, which would hurt their grades. Asians are probably better disciplined than whites, which would improve their grades.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Niele does cite research suggesting that when blacks attend black colleges they are more likely to get the grades their SAT scores predict. It is hard to make grade-point comparisons between different colleges, but if this is true it would support Mr. Niele&rsquo;s sloughing-off theory. There does seem to be no doubt, however, that black students are happier at black colleges &mdash; and there is no affirmative action for them there.</p>
<div id="attachment_103057" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Cheyney.jpg?208409"><img class=" wp-image-103057 " alt="Cheyney University, founded in 1837, is the nation's oldest HBCU." src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Cheyney.jpg?208409" width="611" height="269"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cheyney University, founded in 1837, is the nation&rsquo;s oldest black college.</p></div>
<p>Mr. Niele writes that affirmative action is like high-rise apartments for the poor: a benevolent idea that backfired. This comparison is unfair to high-rises. The projects were not hives of degeneracy when poor whites lived in them, and people in Shanghai live in super-high-density apartment blocks. It was blacks who turned apartment buildings into crack houses.</p>
<p>Bad similes aside, let us hope Mr. Niele is right to conclude that &ldquo;in time affirmative action will come to be viewed as a policy, not a crusade. And as a policy it will be judged by its merits &mdash; and found deeply wanting.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Glimpses of the truth</strong></p>
<p>Despite its generally neo-conservative orientation, Mr. Niele&rsquo;s book contains flashes of dissident insight. He tells us &ldquo;negative stereotyping&rdquo; is a &ldquo;moral failing&rdquo; and yet he cites Philippe Rushton on the genetic basis of ethnocentrism. He claims that only losers identify with their nation or tribe, but concedes that tribalism is &ldquo;hard-wired in our brains.&rdquo; He urges us to embrace American diversity but writes that &ldquo;ethno-racial homogeneity, not heterogeneity, is more likely to improve local and international competitiveness.&rdquo; Mr. Niele even mentions the possibility of race differences in average ability; he lists Arthur Jensen, Michael Levin, Richard Lynn, and Philippe Rushton as sources on the hereditarian view &mdash; though only in a footnote.</p>
<p><i>Wounds that Will Not Heal</i> is therefore a strangely fence-sitting book. Mr. Niele would no doubt bristle at being called a race realist, yet he recognizes many of the reasons why whites prefer homogeneity, and it is a significant step forward to have included these arguments. Mr. Niele can write about the &ldquo;ethnic rage&rdquo; he feels because of race preferences; why can he not understand the &ldquo;ethnic rage&rdquo; of white dispossession? For whatever reason, he does not take the final step: Reject the entire multi-racial project and argue for a society based on human nature rather than egalitarian fantasy.</p>
<p>This term, the US Supreme Court will rule on <i>Fisher v. University of Texas</i>, which could outlaw race preferences completely &mdash; at least until the court is packed with more non-whites. Of course, this will not end the lies and corner-cutting. Many states have banned preferences through ballot initiatives &mdash; no legislature has had enough backbone to ban them &mdash; but colleges practice them anyway. In Florida and Texas, anyone who graduates in the top 10 percent of his high-school class gets into the university system, so the best students even in low-performing all-B&H schools get in, too.</p>
<p>The latest trick is <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/110862/data-mining-the-ineffective-future-affirmative-action-in-education">geographic discrimination</a>. Those coveted &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; candidates conveniently live in clumps, so schools hire data company to find the clumps and then favor applications from certain addresses.</p>
<p>The problem &mdash; and Mr. Niele has covered this as well as anyone &mdash; is the contemptible mentality of white elites. Until that changes, no book or Supreme Court decision will make much difference.</p>

<p>Notice a TV sitcom I chanced to see at a friends, that new Tim the toolman one. Actually pretty good. Black family moves into the neighborhood, someone eggs their car (not for racial reasons), and Tim&rsquo;s silly lib wife goes overboard trying to make the blacks feel welcome. Invites them over for dinner, acts like the typical apologetic white idiot. Finally Tim and the black man admit to each other that they have nothing in common, have no desire to socialize, and are OK with that and the blacks go home. There is even an exchange that goes something like this&hellip;</p>
<p>Black neighbor to Tim, &#8220;And I&rsquo;ll be sure to call the cops should I see a white guy robbing your house.&#8221;</p>
<p>To which Tim replies something like, &#8220;Thanks but that&rsquo;s not likely.&#8221; Kind of surprised me in a good way. How&rsquo;d that slip past the totalitarian democratic thought militia?</p>
<p>Point is&hellip;it&rsquo;s leaking and seeping out, that unflattering Truth. Can&rsquo;t keep it bottled up forever&hellip;</p>

ABSOLUTELY. I think the author I have read so far who is best at this is Jonathan Haidt, in the Righteous Mind, which is one of my favorite books I&rsquo;ve ever read. The Righteous Mind wouldn&rsquo;t be categorized by most people as a race realist book but if you read between the lines in it you can tell that Haidt is knowledgeable about race and is more sort of &#8220;gently preparing&#8221; people for the truth than he is actually spelling it out for them. The Righteous Mind is a very race realist book if you are searching for race realism in it, but nothing in it would be considered offensive to people who are not race realists.<br/>
Yes, it&rsquo;s always nice to see kernels of truth slipping past the PC Thought Police. I just hope there&rsquo;s a way this can all end peacefully but I don&rsquo;t see one.</p>

<p>Come-on, this is actually an argument in favor of affirmative action. Races favor their own race, therefore, the racial spoils system we now have makes sense.</p>
<p>What I notice about affirmative action is that wherever AA is most &#8216;rigorously&rsquo; enforced, the public face presented is that it is whites who are discriminating and that this is wrong and evil.</p>
<p>I suspect the white Obamatrons, after 60 years of affirmative action, and they still favor more - I suspect they think white men will one day benefit from all this &#8216;progressive&rsquo; thinking and will benefit from AA of their own. OK, in truth, whites are simply afraid of dissenting from all this &#8216;progress&rsquo;. Perhaps they do hope white men will one day benefit from AA campaigns, so they feel better in the here and now.</p>
<p>They are in for one huge awakening. This will spell the end for AA in the USA. At least for a long time or until whites become a very small voting block. It will become impossible to justify another 60 years of discrimination against white men, to make up for injustices caused by white men being discriminated against in the first place. At least it will be when we finally break the once-sided conspiracy of silence and point this out. </p>
<p>&#8220;Another study found that white students do not like preferences, faculty dislike them somewhat less, but administrators claim to like them&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this sentence at all.</p>

<p>I told the manager that I liked the candidate, thought he would do a good job, and recommended that he be hired. However, when the manager told the owner about him, the owner said, &#8220;They should ship him back to Africa.&#8221;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-210607" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>ENGLEMAN IS AT IT AGAIN!<br/>
Going far beyond defending Asians and Blacks and Jews (I&rsquo;m half jewish myself, and I&rsquo;m fine with him doing this as long as it&rsquo;s based on honest experience, and I&rsquo;ve never said any group is 100% bad or racist or stupid), Engleman has repeatedly made bizarre, left-wing comments and responses towards things I, and others post.</p>
<p>1. In another post he mentioned that I &#8220;only thought I was being nice to blacks&#8221; and other non-whites before I became a questioning liberal and then a race realist. I&rsquo;ve heard that from Blacks online too. &#8220;You always were a racist!&#8221;, they belligerantly insist, you just thought you weren&rsquo;t! Aka, &#8220;All whites are racist even when they&rsquo;re not racist!&#8221; Wow, if being super-liberal, going out of my way to be extra nice to blacks and other minorities, priding myself on having interracial friendships, looking up to them culturally, feeling very sorry for some of them, being the only kid in the school yard to stick up for the lone black kid getting (rather mildly) racially bullied, etc, is not being nice to them, what is?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, how do you KNOW I &#8220;wasn&rsquo;t really nice&#8221; to blacks? Or asians? Were you there? Are you God?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a VERY, very, very, very different person than I was 12 years ago.</p>
<p>2. In another post, he told another amren poster that whites are only angry about affirmative action and increasing diversity because &#8220;they can&rsquo;t cruise by on their white privilege anymore&#8221; and it&rsquo;s &#8220;not good enough to just show up and be white&#8221; on the job. Yeah, that really sums up the situation and feelings of ALL whites, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Engleman, why are you on this board if you hold those views? You seem to not only be insulting me, but all whites. You don&rsquo;t seem to &#8220;get&#8221; the feelings and experiences of whites who have experienced have doses of reverse racism and diversity overload, including asian diversity overload. You&rsquo;re very dismissive of them. It&rsquo;s really rude and disrespectful.</p>
<p>Engleman, you&rsquo;re either schizophrenic or I&rsquo;ve woken up and landed in the FAR LEFT section of the Huffington Post or something. Even most white liberals I know don&rsquo;t talk or feel that way.</p>
<p>I also suspect Engleman only has experiences with Asians as the model minority group, like in small white or white/black towns where they are forced to fit in. As in he has no experience with them in large groups or masses or situations where they are NOT a minority at all. I do. I&rsquo;ve repeatedly told you that during a certain 6 year or so period of my young adult life, 80% + of my friends were east asian, east indian or black. Regrettably. Luckily I have white friends now who understand me better. It&rsquo;s just that much easier in life to have ONE LESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT. When I get in a fight with a white friend, I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it being about Race. It&rsquo;s one less thing to consider. One less reason to resent and envy.</p>
<p>I have talked to many white friends, all of whom are liberal, btw, and their experiences with asians or blacks as &#8220;friends&#8221; were pretty much the same. One tires of being left out of their &#8220;asian-american&#8221; cliques, etc. Even most white liberals admit that Asians are pretty boring, en masse. As do Blacks. </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t seem to understand the many, many, many permutations and layers of &#8220;drama&#8221; that mingling with people of other races and cultures (aka, &#8220;Diversity&#8221;) brings- for everyone of every race.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t just a black/white thing anymore.</p>

<p>That is because most White liberals prefer the company of Blacks over Asians, because they see Blacks as being a million times more hip and cool than Asians. They see Blacks as more vibrantly exotic than Asians.</p>
<p>White liberals love the &#8220;Mah Dick&#8221; culture of urban inner city Blacks. That is why there are tens of million of White liberals in this country who worship Black rappers and Black sports athletes.</p>
<p>I also noticed that you believe there are only 2 Nonwhite races in the world, and that is Blacks and Asians.</p>
<p>Because I NEVER see you mention Amerindians/Mestizos when you bring up the Nonwhite races of the world. Are you just lumping these people into the &#8220;White&#8221; category ?</p>
<p>So you see most of the illegal immigrants in this country as &#8220;White&#8221;, because most illegal immigrants in this country do not look like Serena Williams or Jackie Chan.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-210626" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Everything in life is PERSONAL&hellip; Because I grew up on the East Coast, I have yet to experience that much hostility from Latinos, the Mexicans who dominate the West and are more aggressive about it out there. I have had a few isolated incidents with them, of course, but the reality is, I was never super close to them as friends anyways (actually 2 I was close to, and I felt neither hated whites), so I just don&rsquo;t have that much experience with Latinos, as in that much personal reason to be angry at them. Well I resent them as a group &#8220;taking over&#8221; and getting affirmative action all the way, am fully aware of the crime/iq stats on them, etc. My feelings towards Latinos are very paradoxical in this respect. Super conflicted and at odds.</p>
<p>I lived in Puerto Rican hood for 2 years. While, of course, overall, they are ghetto and thuggish, I never once experienced racial hostility from them. Not while I lived there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird&hellip; on the one hand, I would like to halt all non-white immigration and particularly Latino immigration because of the affirmative action component. On the other hand, out of all the races, I think I find Latinos to be the most friendly, the most like us (due to some european genes? ), the most affable (unlike the robotic asians or the endlessly racially hostile blacks). In some ways, I find Latinos to be the least racist. Many have noted that MOST Latinos, barring La Raza activists, are very apolitical and not into &#8220;victimhood&#8221;. That could indeed change. I&rsquo;ve noted that many Latinos I met in life &#8220;kissed up&#8221; to whites and often expressed race realist sentiments themselves, especially towards blacks. </p>
<p>Amer-inds are apparently Mongoloids, but I&rsquo;m not big on dividing the world into 3 races anyways, I believe there are spectrums.</p>
<p>I say &#8220;non-white&#8221; a lot not to pretend all non-whites are the same- they are incredibly different from one another, culturally and in other ways. But what do ALL NON-WHITES SHARE???????????????????????</p>
<p>ANSWER: They all have the *potential to resent &#8220;white&#8221; people&hellip;.. to hate them, to mistreat them, to envy them, etc. Not all do.</p>
<p>They all, to a lesser or greater degree, don&rsquo;t understand &#8220;whites&#8221; culturally, or understand our feeligns on the racial stuff, and get in on that &#8220;I&rsquo;m an oppressed victim of society and therefore have the right to be nasty and angry to &#8220;white&#8221; people stuff&#8221;.</p>

<p>http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/12/11/3137968/puerto-rico-tackling-fearful-murder.html</p>
<p>What do you think is the reason why Puerto Ricans are such a violent people ? Could it be the Taino and Sub Saharan African genes in their DNA ? I will go with that.<br/>
&#8216;</p>
<p>Puerto Ricans are &#8220;warm&#8221; &#8220;bubbly&#8221;, and &#8220;friendly right before they shoot and stab you. Puerto Rico&rsquo;s per capita murder rate is closer to Detroit levels than it is to Denmark levels.</p>

<p>If you support affirmative action than you are an enemy of the White race. So that means at least 63 percent of Latinos are enemies of the White race.</p>
<p>You sure do have a very positive opinion of Latin American culture, a culture that was created as a result of racial miscegenation between Spaniards, Sub Saharan Africans, and Amerindians.</p>

<p>White liberals DON&rsquo;T necessarily prefer blacks, they just have nothing in common with the cliquish, boring Asians either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying because we don&rsquo;t want to buy the Ferrari we should be thrilled to drive a Volvo or something. </p>
<p>We respect Asians work ethic, sense of design, drawing skills, etc, but find them too boring to be around socially, and resent their ethnic cliquishness from which we inevitably learn we are also excluded from. We get that &#8220;I have nothing in common and I will never be as close to this person as I am to a fellow white (however imperfect whites are too) person so why f-ing bother after awhile&#8221; feeling.</p>
<p>We respect Blacks cultural contributions in music and such, but find them often too aggressive, resentful, &#8220;get revengey&#8221; even on whites who are nice to them, thuggish and even violent to make worth the effort to &#8220;deal with&#8221;. </p>
<p>You guys seem to think problems with &#8220;Diversity&#8221; are only about Crime. It&rsquo;s not just that. It&rsquo;s resenting the CULTURAL ALIENATION, the double standards, the sense of BETRAYAL you feel when you put yourself out there in a post-racial way only to see time and time again that your &#8220;asian-american&#8221; friend prefers her &#8220;asian-american&#8221; people and social clubs. It&rsquo;s seeing time and time and time again friendships (or any interactions) with them, or Blacks, or any of the non-whites, are disappointing, don&rsquo;t work out, somehow lacking, etc. </p>
<p>I live in NYC. Diversity capital of the world. You don&rsquo;t seem to understand how this all unfolds on the ground.</p>
<p>Btw, I recently met an Asian girl who was adopted by Whites&hellip; I have no problem with her, and have no doubt she is nothing like the stereotypical &#8220;asian-american&#8221; boring dull third world immigrant types we drown in here. She&rsquo;s capable of holding down a conversation, being open and expressive, etc. CULTURE, CULTURE, CULTURE&hellip;.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-199571" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I agree with a lot of your comments John but I think it&rsquo;s unfair of you<br/>
to say that East Asians and Jews are &#8220;superior&#8221; to &#8220;white<br/>
Gentiles&#8221; because of their higher IQs. I think that&rsquo;s unfair to say because I think East<br/>
Asians and Europeans just have different strengths. I think<br/>
that Ashkenazi Jews are basically one especially smart subgroup of Europeans<br/>
and I don&rsquo;t doubt their superior average verbal intelligence over Gentiles but I think that in terms of Europeans vs. Asians, Europeans are essentially<br/>
more verbally-oriented and less naturally conformist than Asians, and Asians are more<br/>
conformist, less aggressive (maybe due to lower testosterone levels), and have<br/>
higher nonverbal intelligence. I believe that Europeans&rsquo; traits have led<br/>
them to invent more than Asians have, but I think that Asians&rsquo; traits serve<br/>
them well in the modern world and are conducive to the formation of stable societies<br/>
that use Western technology (like Japan). I really admire East Asians for their good work ethics,<br/>
humility, and law abidingness compared to every other race including whites,<br/>
but I also think that white males inventing almost everything associated with<br/>
the modern world was not just an &#8220;accident of history&#8221;; it was<br/>
because white males have certain qualities besides high IQ that are less<br/>
present in white females and Asians. So I think it&rsquo;s unfair of you to say that<br/>
Asians are &#8220;superior&#8221; to whites. They&rsquo;re just a little different, and<br/>
yes their IQs are higher, but again I think the white male track record of<br/>
inventing almost everything shows that something else besides just IQ is at<br/>
play behind the awe-inspiring accomplishments of males of European ancestry (testosterone in combination with IQ, perhaps - Asians and women are lacking in the former while blacks are lacking in the latter).</p>
<p>Have you read or heard of the book &#8220;Human Accomplishment&#8221; by Charles<br/>
Murray? Before he wrote the book Murray intended to give a significant nod to<br/>
Asian accomplishment but found during research that he could not justify<br/>
it.</p>
<p>(Note: When I talk about &#8220;white male accomplishment&#8221; I count Jews as white. I do believe Jews are an especially accomplished white subgroup due to high verbal intelligence.)</p>
<p>John, I think you have the same complex liberals have where it&rsquo;s emotionally difficult for you to praise your own race even when it&rsquo;s warranted because my god, &#8220;Nordic Gentiles&#8221; are amazing and everyone knows it. They are beautiful and when left to their own devices create perhaps the best societies in the world. Would you really rather live in China or Japan than in a hypothetical, homogeneously white Sweden or Norway?</p>

<p>Whether modern liberalism is a modern disorder born of the wealth accumulated by modern capitalism or something more deeply rooted in the human psyche is worthy of serious discussion. </p>
<p>Liberalism is secularized Christianity. They both talk about love of their fellow man and bringing about a kinder, more peaceful world. But there is ample room in their hearts for the most ferocious condemnation of anyone who doesn&rsquo;t buy in or blows holes in their artificial myths. Both believe in Original Sin, whereby the sins of your long-dead ancestors still contaminate you, requiring the cleansing blood of the Lamb of God to wash away your sins. Only difference is that liberals refer to original sin as &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; and the Lamb of God as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>One other difference, Christianity is universal, while liberalism only applies to whites.</p>

It would be funny if that experience brought him to Amren and he saw your post. In high school I was appalled by how many of the black students treated white teachers as really less than human. They had no empathy whatsoever for someone just trying to follow rules and do his or her job. I hated high school too and I couldn&rsquo;t stand some of my teachers, and yes there were some white students who behaved badly, but it was black students who seemed really incapable of empathizing with teachers in any way. </p>
<p>Misbehaving white boys usually seem to feel at least some guilt. My brother (who is in high school) dislikes a lot of his teachers and many of them don&rsquo;t like him because he is kind of a know-it-all slacker, but recently he shocked my mom by saying, out of the blue, &#8220;I think I owe some of my teachers letters of apology.&#8221; I think she almost cried, she was so shocked and proud of him.</p>
<p>I bet the guy from your high school was not unchanged by that teaching position. Even if he did improve the lives of any individual students, I bet he encountered many that he sensed could not be helped. Although I have to say I have heard a number of horror stories about blacks from white liberals who &#8220;tutor&#8221; blacks and it is amazing how long some of them continue to explain it all away and keep trying to help. I sometimes think some of them, especially the women, would keep trying to &#8220;reach&#8221; the kids forever no matter what the kids did. I really think it&rsquo;s an innate mental condition sometimes, not being able to consider certain explanations for what they see.</p>

standard.<br/>
Problem for the person that hates Christians and Christianity: How to post anti-Christian comments on AmRen. </p>
<p>The AmRen family agrees that liberalism is a bad thing. But how to create the illusion that Christianity is a bad thing? </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see &mdash; make up some cockamamie comparisons between liberalism<br/>
and<br/>
Christianity and see if anyone is dumb enough to lump the two together.<br/>
But can we count on the AmRen editor to allow the anti-Christian<br/>
comments to pass or will he be as diligent opposing anti-Christian posts<br/>
as he is for anti-Jewish posts. </p>
<p>Liberalism is like Jews in<br/>
American society. They both talk about love of their fellow man and<br/>
bringing about Tikkun olam, a kinder, more peaceful world. But there is<br/>
ample room in their hearts for the most ferocious condemnation of anyone who<br/>
doesn&rsquo;t buy into or blows holes in their artificial myths of racism and anti-semitism.<br/>
Both<br/>
believe in Original Condition / Sin, whereby one party is the Chosen<br/>
People and the other is the Inferior People with the sins of long-dead<br/>
ancestors still contaminate you, requiring the cleansing blood of the<br/>
Holocaust to wash away your sins. Only difference is that liberals refer<br/>
to Original Condition / Sin as &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; and the Holocaust as<br/>
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

<p>But I think like David Ashton, I disagree with both of you: there are Christians and Jews who are race realists. So the common denominator to white traitors is not Christianity or Judaism, it is something else, another faith, not revolving around a god, a faith that is a mix of dogmas like globalism/liberalism/diversity lovers/white self haters or who don&rsquo;t care/affirmative action supporters/pathological altruists etc (we should really come up with a terminology, it is easier when the enemy has a name we could all agree on).</p>
<p>That said indeed the white traitors dogmas have similarities with those religions, as those religions don&rsquo;t pay attention to the races of their followers, but as I was trying to say, they go further, as not only races are not important for them but the white race has less status than the others.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that is true, being that several states have banned affirmative action and yet whites are still discriminated against in those state. In those states private companies are still allowed to use &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; to their hearts content, and do. That&rsquo;s why it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are matched up to a school that is above their talents. Or rather, that&rsquo;s why we need affirmative action in employment also. </p>
<p>I know a liberal, he watches all those shows were the purpose of the show seems to be to make fun of conservatives, Cobert, Steward Daily show, Bill Maher, and he used to be upset at affirmative action too. He&rsquo;s a college graduate and has two brothers who are college graduates, none of them could get university jobs. He felt it was because of affirmative action. He felt it was a huge deal/very omnipresent. Perhaps this is where the author is coming from. </p>
<p>Personally, I come from a different place. I know of well-paying jobs such as city bus driver, where there are no whites, and they have an all-important diversity plan and &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; training. Somehow that never means hiring even one white bus driver.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-199100" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Russell Niele is to be praised, not damned. Let us gently point out the error of his ways.</p>
<p>According to the article, academic Niele is a lecturer at Princeton. The rank of lecturer does not carry tenure nor the promise of tenure. Lecturers can be fired for any reason or no reason. They work semester to semester for about $4000 a course in Texas. Perhaps the pay is higher at Princeton, but it will still less than half that of a new tenure track assistant professor, and possibly less than a new schoolteacher.</p>
<p>All faculty that I knew in a 30 year career in higher ed were under enormous pressure to toe the line spouted by administrators. You could get your salary frozen permanently and be denied any recognition by administrators for straying from the line. You could be ostracized by your fellows, alone in a hostile world in which interaction with other thinkers, necessary for your intellectual development, would be denied you. I myself suffered greatly for defending heterosexuality, the traditional family, and masculinity, while condeming feminism. Not toeing the line leads to fear and paranoia, justified I might add.<br/>
Mr. Niele, I can almost guarantee you, is as I write, being targeted by progressives for removal from their multicultural paradise.<br/>
Let me add one more thing. The psychological pressure to conform can often lead a person to not be exactly sure of what he believes or what the truth is. When the big lies are repeated enough, and people believe them, you often question yourself for not believing them. Marching to the beat of your own drum is difficult. Bravo to Mr. Nieli for doing so.</p>

And, as an aside, have any of you noticed that your local news programs now contain egregious spelling errors on the bottom captions of news stories?

<p>This misses the mark. Mainstream conservatism is the problem. It keeps the lid on white solidarity by enlisting white conservatives to the cause of anti-racism directed towards white liberals. The notion that affirmative action harms blacks and Hispanics is a good example of this.</p>
<p>There should be a new &#8220;Pro-White&#8221; party whose sole mission is to draw votes away from the GOP to hasten its collapse.

Then anti-whites forced ALL and ONLY white people to &#8220;integrate&#8221; or face consequences for being &#8220;naziswhowantokill6millionjews.&#8221; Now anti-whites are counting down the days until ALL and ONLY white children become minorities and eventually extinct EVERYWHERE. It&rsquo;s Genocide. &#8220;Anti-racist&#8221; is a codeword for anti-white.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-204556" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is a very good review, but Jackson repeatedly misspells Nieli&rsquo;s name. Nieli, not Niele.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Mr. Niele supports this view by pointing out that blacks do worse in school than their test scores suggest they should. Their grades are not as good as those of whites who get the same test scores, and the tougher the school, the wider the gap.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The fact that test scores overpredict black performance probably has nothing to do with them not trying as hard as whites. Rather, it&rsquo;s because of regression toward the mean. The IQ mean of blacks is one standard deviation below that of whites, which means that a black student&rsquo;s high test score is more likely to be a fluke than a white student&rsquo;s. If you have white and black students with the same high SAT scores, their subsequent academic performance will tend to regress toward their respective racial averages.</p>

<p>When Caucasians begin to realize that we are the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob/Israel we will have identified ourselves as The Tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>Today if you mention this in almost any Christian Church they will ask you to leave. It&rsquo;s happened to me both in person and via the internet. This information is not some knee jerk reaction for superiority or a need to be part of something.</p>
<p>&#8220;For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye<br/>
should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to<br/>
Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.&#8221; Romans 11:25<br/>
We will learn of our inheritance and the nations won&rsquo;t like it but that&rsquo;s to bad. The eclipse of the Sun, Moon and Stars is about to be lifted. See Revelations</p>
