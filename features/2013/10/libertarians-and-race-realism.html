Who are our potential allies?</div> 
</div> 


<p>For those of us who enjoy a touch of libertarianism, the <a href="/news/2013/09/property-and-freedom.html">news</a> of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s recent appearance at Hans-Hermann Hoppe&rsquo;s Property and Freedom Society was well received. It also begs the valuable question, &ldquo;Which libertarians are friendly to race realism, and which are not?&rdquo; As it stands, what Mr. Taylor <a href="/ar/2002/01/index.html#article2">wrote</a> over a decade ago in his review of Prof. Hoppe&rsquo;s <i>Democracy: The God That Failed</i> is still (unfortunately) for the most part true: &ldquo;Libertarians, to the extent they have any influence on American policy, have been bitter opponents of immigration control. From the Cato Institute, to the Libertarian Party, to the editorial pages of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, their generally laudable opposition to government control leads them to view border control as just one more intolerable act of government tyranny.&rdquo; However, both then and now, Prof. Hoppe and a small band of allies within the libertarian movement have fought that trend; and they deserve notice for their principled and courageous stance.</p>
<div id="attachment_106171" style="width: 416px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HansHermannHoppe.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106171" alt="Hans-Hermann Hoppe" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HansHermannHoppe.jpg" width="406" height="270"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hans-Hermann Hoppe</p></div>
<p>Prof. Hoppe (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;HHH&rdquo;) and his Property and Freedom Society is a good place to start. Founded in 2005, it was forged in large part out of Prof. Hoppe&rsquo;s dislike for the mainstream and politically correct libertarian group, the Mont Pelerin Society, of which he had been a member. Both the PFS&rsquo;s tone and speakers lists have been influenced from the beginning with touches of race-realism and anti-establishmentarianism gleaned from Prof. Hoppe&rsquo;s participation in the John Randolph Club. The latter group, paleo-libertarian in pedigree, featured many speakers familiar to <i>AmRen</i> readers, such as Taki Theodoracopulos, Joe Sobran, Sam Francis, and during the early years, even Michael Levin and Jared Taylor. Unfortunately the Randolph Club has been more or less dormant for many years now, after several of its main participants died, and the remnants began fighting among themselves. Occasional <i>AmRen</i> contributor James Lubinskas&rsquo; <i>The End of Paleoconservatism</i> examines that group&rsquo;s fall in greater detail.</p>
<p>The talks given at Prof. Hoppe&rsquo;s gatherings can be found easily on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=property+and+freedom+society&amp;oq=property&amp;gs_l=youtube.3.0.35i39l2j0l8.2054.4236.0.5119.10.7.1.0.0.0.134.588.4j2.6.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.R5kfb_nERQg">YouTube</a> (although this year&rsquo;s are not available yet), and feature not only <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OFLW4-gwBU">Richard Spencer</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VaowmPtpm8">Peter Brimelow</a>, as Mr. Taylor mentioned, but other prominent race realists as well, such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-w4tqkHuEQ">John Derbyshire</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CYJt5R9KEc">Paul Gottfried.</a> Prof. Hoppe also wrote an interesting <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-property-and-freedom-society-reflections-after-five-years">reflection</a> on the origins and nature of his society, which can be found on <i>VDARE</i> &mdash; frankly, any libertarian willing to post on <i>VDARE</i> is a libertarian worth listening to. Additionally, much of Prof. Hoppe&rsquo;s writings on immigration and discrimination can be found online. Especially noteworthy for <i>AmRen</i> readers are, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/hans-hermann-hoppe/on-free-immigration-and-forced-integration/">On Free Immigration and Forced Integration</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe3.html">Secession, the State, and the Immigration Problem.</a>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lew Rockwell is another libertarian figure worth knowing about, but is something of an enigma. In 1982 he founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute, which quickly became a conservative and radical counterweight to the increasingly liberal and mainstream Cato Institute. Murray Rothbard, considered a kind of libertarian god to many, would soon join him after being <a href="../../../journals/lf/1981/1981_01-04.pdf">purged</a> from the Cato Institute, which he had helped found. The Mises Institute, while more libertarian than anything else, has time and again shown itself to be unconcerned with the taboos that even many other libertarians fear. It has published sharp critiques of such liberal totems as feminism and <a href="http://mises.org/document/1852/Woodrow-Wilsons-Defeat-in-Yugoslavia-The-End-of-a-Multicultural-Utopia">multiculturalism</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Rockwell would also go on to <a href="../../../journals/liberty/Liberty_Magazine_January_1990.pdf">propose</a> a &ldquo;paleo libertarian alliance&rdquo; in 1990 that would make the case for libertarians to avoid the company of certain &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; groups that had begun making common cause with the movement, such as habitual drug users, nudists, and the like. Instead, Mr. Rockwell argued that libertarians should establish closer ties with the rising paleo-conservative movement. That same year Mr. Rockwell took his own advice and started the paleo-libertarian <a href="http://www.unz.org/Pub/RothbardRockwellReport"><i>Rothbard-Rockwell Report</i></a>, which ran into the late &rsquo;90s and featured a plethora of <i>AmRen </i>contributors such as Michael Levin, Paul Gottfried, and Robert Weissberg, as well as the then less well known Hans-Hermann Hoppe.</p>
<div id="attachment_106173" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/BlumertRockwellGordonRothbard.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106173" alt="Burton Blumert, Lew Rockwell, David Gordon, and Murray Rothbard." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/BlumertRockwellGordonRothbard.jpg" width="550" height="395"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Burton Blumert, Lew Rockwell, David Gordon, and Murray Rothbard.</p></div>
<p>During this period, a very harmonious relationship existed between race realists, paleos, and libertarians. Murray Rothbard endorsed Pat Buchanan for president in 1992, the Mises Institute was unafraid of inviting both <a href="http://mises.org/media/1073/Right-to-Bear-Arms">Sam Francis</a> and Joe Sobran to its conferences, and rumor has it that Mr. Rockwell was even ghost writing newsletters for one Ron Paul, which <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/politics/99666/ron-paul-newsletters-part-two">referenced</a> Jared Taylor in a positive light. The newsletters were controversial due to their unconventional views on Martin Luther King and racial orthodoxy. It was out of this paleo-libertarian atmosphere that <i>LewRockwell.com</i> was created in 1999.</p>
<p>Though originally not much different in pedigree and authorship from the <i>Rothbard-Rockwell Report</i>, the site has become steadily more politically correct. Who is featured on the website has to be separated into three categories: those who are listed on the <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/columnists">contributors page</a>, those who are not listed but still have personal pages, and those who have been deleted. There are many good writers listed: Prof. Hoppe, Pat Buchanan, and Clyde Wilson to name a few. There are also many good writers who are not listed, but still have pages, such as: <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/author/keith-preston/">Keith Preston</a>, <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/author/marcus-epstein/">Marcus Epstein</a>, <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/author/chilton-williamson-jr/">Chilton Williamson</a>, <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/author/michael-c-tuggle/">Michael Tuggle</a> and <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/author/h-arthur-scott-trask/">H. A. Scott Trask</a>. As for those who have been deleted, many were the best, such as Michael Levin and Jared Taylor.</p>
<p><i>VDARE</i> published the most informative <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/lew-rockwell-and-the-strange-death-or-at-least-suspended-animation-of-paleolibertarianism">account</a> of <i>LewRockwell.com</i>&rsquo;s devolution, but Lew Rockwell&rsquo;s own suspect recanting of what was, <i><a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2002/05/lew-rockwell/what-i-learned-from-paleoism/">What I Learned From Paleoism</a></i>, is also interesting. Unfortunately it seems likely that, with time, <i>LewRockwell.com</i> will continue its slide into political correctness and either delete or hide more authors-but for the time being, it is still worth visiting; it still carries the likes of Fred Reed and Chuck Baldwin.</p>
<p>Another important highlight of <i>LewRockwell.com</i> are the archives of the late Murray Rothbard-a man frequently credited with both inventing Anarcho-Capitalist theory, and popularizing Austrian economics in America. Not only was he a <a href="http://mises.org/media/1063/Two-Just-Wars-1776-and-1861">proud Copperhead</a> and a <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/murray-n-rothbard/life-in-the-old-right/">vocal supporter of Strom Thurmond</a> in his college days, but he also wrote a glowing review of Richard Hernstein and Charles Murray&rsquo;s <i>The Bell Curve</i>, and his famous essay, <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/murray-n-rothbard/were-not-equal/"><i>Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature</i></a>, is a masterpiece.</p>
<div id="attachment_106176" style="width: 339px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/BellCurve.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106176" alt="Still considered &quot;controversial.&quot;" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/BellCurve.jpg" width="329" height="500"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Still considered &#8220;controversial.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>In many ways, it could be said that Hans-Hermann Hoppe is keeping alive the kind of fearless and conservative-oriented libertarianism that Murray Rothbard so perfectly embodied, and that Lew Rockwell&rsquo;s various organizations and publications kept afloat for so long until his slow retreat of the last decade and a half.</p>
<p>The politically correct libertarians (who have many different monikers: beltway libertarians, left/liberal libertarians, and neo-libertarians are the most common) oscillate between vociferously denouncing their more realistic counterparts, and completely ignoring them. <i>Reason</i> magazine, put out by the Reason Foundation, is typical in this respect. While it acts as if Hans-Hermann Hoppe doesn&rsquo;t exist, (just as <i>The National Review</i> acts as though Paul Gottfried and Jared Taylor do not exist) it has also gone out of its way to <a href="http://takimag.com/article/why_the_beltway_libertarians_are_trying_to_smear_ron_paul/#axzz2gPuVuDf7">attack</a> Ron Paul for being too right-wing. Every organization funded by the Koch Brothers either attacks from the left or completely ignores conservative libertarians. This is true of <em>Reason</em>, the Heritage Foundation, George Mason University, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/behind-the-curtain-exclusive-the-koch-brothers-secret-bank-96669.html">etc</a>. Cato-affiliated Tom Palmer seems only to <a href="http://tomgpalmer.com/2005/01/21/racism-and-bigotry-delivered-courtesy-of-lew-rockwell/">attack</a>, and does so <a href="http://tomgpalmer.com/2005/07/01/hans-hermann-hoppe-and-the-german-extremist-nationalist-right/">over</a> and <a href="http://tomgpalmer.com/2004/09/25/gary-north-lew-rockwell-and-the-politics-of-stoning-heretics-and-homosexuals-to-death/">over</a>. Meanwhile, the so-called &ldquo;<a href="http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/">Bleeding Heart Libertarians</a>&rdquo; are almost the exact opposite in this regard, and seem to dedicate all of their time to earning a pat on the head from the Cultural Marxist left by ignoring any and every libertarian who has ever been touched by controversy. Unsurprisingly, they <a href="http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2013/08/reasons-for-open-borders/">advocate</a> open borders.</p>
<p>The two most powerful open-borders radicals among the libertarian ranks are, by far, <a href="../../../journals/jls/21_3/21_3_2.pdf">Anthony Gregory and Walter Block</a>. Walter Block has been with the Mises Institute for some time now, and is frequently Prof. Hoppe&rsquo;s sparring partner on immigration. One such ideological duel can be found in <a href="http://mises.org/periodical.aspx?Id=3&amp;volume=Vol.%2013%20Num.%202">this issue</a> of the <em>Journal for Libertarian Studies </em>(which is put out by Mises), in which John Hospers, the founder of the Libertarian Party, voiced emphatic opposition to the idea of open borders. Anthony Gregory is of a younger generation of libertarians, and works for the fairly small Independent Institute-which also employs <a href="http://www.independent.org/aboutus/person_detail.asp?id=494">Alvaro Vargas Llosa</a> (son of Mario) who recently penned a <a href="http://www.independent.org/globalcrossings/">gushingly pro-immigration book</a>. Troublingly, Anthony Gregory and Walter Block have both found ways to be featured frequently in what are otherwise reliable bastions of sensible libertarianism, namely the Mises Institute and <i>LewRockwell.com</i>. Mr. Gregory seems to have redoubled his efforts, having made it into <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/author/anthony-gregory/"><i>The American Conservative</i></a> as well, while also being published in liberal publications such as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anthony-gregory/"><i>The Huffington Post</i></a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_106175" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HayekMises.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106175" alt="Friedrich von Hayek and Ludwig van Mises" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HayekMises.jpg" width="550" height="361"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Friedrich von Hayek and Ludwig von Mises</p></div>
<p>Two other important libertarian open-border advocates are <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-fulford-file-the-ugly-side-of-open-borders-sneering-libertarian-economists">Alex Nowrasteh</a> and Jesus Huerta de Soto, while two other important libertarian immigration restrictionists are <a href="../../../journals/jls/13_2/13_2_7.pdf">Gary North</a> and <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/libertarianism-conservatism-and-immigration-the-hoppe-solution">Sean Gabb</a>. It must be conceded, however, that the former duo has a great deal more influence than the latter. Mr. Nowrasteh has gained prominence from the media&rsquo;s focus on immigration over these last few months, while Mr. De Soto is something of a mainstay in the libertarian scene. Meanwhile, Gary North has developed a reputation as a bit of an old coot, and is often cited as someone the Mises Institute should purge, while Sean Gabb has still not gained much name recognition in the United States.</p>
<p>If there were to be an underdog victory for immigration restrictionist libertarians, it would likely come not only from the groundwork laid by Prof. Hoppe and his annual gatherings of banished intellectuals, but from the historian Thomas Woods, Jr.. Most famous for his surprise hit, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.regnery.com/books/the-politically-incorrect-guide-to-american-history/">The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History</a>,&rdquo; Mr. Woods also writes for <a href="http://mises.org/media/authors/424/Thomas-E-Woods-Jr">Mises</a>, <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/author/thomas-woods/"><i>LewRockwell.com</i></a>, and a handful of other publications. From time to time, he shows fairly strong conservative leanings; in his review of Prof. Hoppe&rsquo;s book, he recommended reading it in tandem with Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s then-new <i>The Death of the West</i>. Additionally, he was <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2005/02/thomas-dilorenzo/why-they-hate-tom-woods/">once a member</a> of the League of the South-and he is level-headed when it comes to immigration.</p>
<div id="attachment_106174" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/TomWoods.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106174" alt="Thomas Woods, Jr." src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/TomWoods.jpg" width="550" height="367"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Thomas Woods, Jr.</p></div>
<p>Self-styled libertarians and paleo-libertarians can also be found throughout the alternative/dissident right. The late Joe Sobran, who maintained a strong friendship with Murray Rothbard until the latter&rsquo;s untimely death, was ultimately convinced by Hans-Hermann Hoppe&rsquo;s Anarcho-Capitalist ideas and went from being a strict constitutionalist to a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.sobran.com/reluctant.shtml">reluctant anarchist</a>.&rdquo; Ilana Mercer has similar leanings as well, and writes a paleo-libertarian column for the Russian organization, <i>RT</i>. Richard Spencer of NPI considers Prof. Hoppe, Dr. Rothbard, and Ludwig von Mises to be essential reading. <i>Taki&rsquo;s Magazine</i> which in the past has featured both Ms. Mercer and Mr. Spencer, has always had paleo-libertarian leanings as well.</p>
<p>However, when all is said and done, immigration restrictionists within libertarian circles have just as hard a time as those anywhere else. The Mises Institute has been labeled a hate group &mdash; an indignity that the Cato Institute never had to suffer, and it is well known that the latter has a great deal more money than the former. Part of the reason Prof. Hoppe now lives in Turkey may be because so many other libertarians were trying to throw him under the bus (though his <a href="http://mises.org/daily/1792">troubles</a> with Cultural Marxist academia probably influenced the decision as well). But, in defiantly inviting Jared Taylor to the latest gathering of the Property and Freedom Society, Prof. Hoppe has struck another blow to the stifling political correctness and dispossessing open border radicalism of mainstream libertarianism; with any luck, others will follow his lead.</p>

<p>Well not so fast. in his &#8220;Reflections on the Revolution in France&#8221; Edmund Burke wrote, &#8220;The effect of liberty to individuals is, that they may do what they please: we ought to see what it will please them to do, before we risk congratulations, which may soon be turned into complaints.&#8221;</p>
<p>We should also ask: for whom shall we increase liberty? It is clearly in the interest of the business community to open the borders to more immigrants. More immigrants mean more consumers and more job applicants. By the law of supply and demand this means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits. </p>
<p>Easing immigration restrictions also increases the liberty of people who want to move to the United States. </p>
<p>Those who claim to be libertarians while advocating more immigration restrictions, or no immigration at all, are appropriating a trendy label while advocating an un libertarian agenda.</p>
<p>Burke also wrote, &#8220;liberty, when men act in bodies, is power.&#8221; Since at least 1980 the liberty, the power, and the wealth of the business community has increased. Those who own and run the United States have certainly benefited. Has the rest of the country? </p>

Immigration restriction is compatible with libertarianism from either a consequentialist or deontological ethical system. The deontologists could make a plausible case that since we live in a world of public property, it&rsquo;s the right of citizens to to exclude people from that property to stop them from trespassing. A consequentialist libertarian could show how open-borders would reduce real-world liberty because of the political externalities or how multi-culturalism leads to decreases in liberty in order to force people to get along.</p>

Let&rsquo;s say that in a free society National Widgets, Inc., decides to hire Rufus Washington to be a production line manager so that they can crow about their &#8220;commitment to diversity.&#8221; Let&rsquo;s say that Rufus turns out that he is incompetent but they decide to keep him. Firing him won&rsquo;t bring down government heat, but they are worried about bad PR, so they keep him even though his incompetence results in defective widgets, wasted resources, and added costs. How long will National Widgets&rsquo; customer put up with buying inferior product? They will very soon switch to another widget company, one that hires and promotes people on the basis of merit.</p>
<p>Affirmative action, quotas, set-asides, whatever you want to call it, cripples all the companies by forcing them to retain incompetent employees in the name of diversity.</p>

The problem is that the libertarian establishment is wedded to the idea of open-borders and racial egalitarianism. Open borders is not really a libertarian concept because in the absence of a state there would be more borders. The reason is that beltway libertarians have sort of become more and more egalitarian over the years in order to try to get mainstream acceptance which is going to fail because liberal idealism is much more attractive to most people. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not certain whether libertarian institutions could even exist without a majority European population. The only historical evidence we have comes from European societies. I mean libertarian in the sense of having lots of negative and positive liberty, not just in the size of the state. Some African countries have small states but very little in terms of negative or positive liberty. </p>

You could choose who you serve at your privately owned business. You could gather with whatever group you wanted to and exclude people you do not wish to include. I&rsquo;m not a libertarian, but I get what they&rsquo;re talking about - We&rsquo;d have more physical borders as well as mental borders, if you will.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-360667" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>So we&rsquo;re back to this mess again.</p>
<p>If you already have a gallon of ice cream, why would you willingly mix it with a gallon of mud? Or any amount of mud? Racialism is the ice cream, libertarianism is the mud. (I&rsquo;m being polite when I say &#8220;mud,&#8221; if you catch my drift.)</p>
<p>Yeah, there are racially correct thinking libertarians out there, that freely and openly admit that they&rsquo;re swimming against a stiff current. So why don&rsquo;t they get out of the stream and find a new one? All I know is that if I&rsquo;m on a dead horse, I&rsquo;m getting off the horse. Why bother with all this navel gazing into an ideology that in its pure form is tee totally against us and even taking out its treacherous elements, might not serve us that well?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the other consideration. Even if we try to combine racialism with the non-bad elements of libertarianism, how far is that going to get us politically? I can assure you that the kind of political candidate that spends campaign season campaigning for immigration patriotism, combating the black undertow but then says he wants free trade with the cheap labor world and wants to take away your Social Security and Medicare will win almost no votes.</p>
<p>We win the future by combining social racialism with mixed socio-capitalist economics and economic nationalism. Think: Pat Buchanan, not Ron Paul.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s yet another consideration. What do racialist libertarians really want? Are they racialists first who advocate the non-treacherous elements of libertarianism within a locked down ethnostate? Or are they libertarians first who cynically latch onto racialism in a cuckold manuever, in that they know libertarianism is extinct when white people are? If they&rsquo;re the former, then they can be trusted even though we have our disagreements on what kind of economics we should have in our locked down ethnostate. If they&rsquo;re the latter, then they shouldn&rsquo;t be trusted because at the first moment that the heat gets too hot, they&rsquo;ll turn Judas and deny racialism like Peter did Christ.</p>
<p>Proof of what I said? The Rockwell-Paul axis that this article talks about, and how quickly it ran away from us when they thought we were no longer useful to them.</p>
<p>A libertarian racialist that is truly in his heart racialist first would sound a whole lot more like Jared Taylor and a lot less libertarian. That most libertarian racialists don&rsquo;t sound more like Jared Taylor makes me suspicious of their motives.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-360684" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The issue comes down differences of political philsophy ultimately. Us racial conservatives believe race is a biologically real ontological distinction which manifests itself negatively in society whenever and wherever diversity is present. Because of this, the best thing for societies to do is segregate and for nations to form on the basis of (in descending order of importance) race, language, religion, broader culture, politics, economics. </p>
<p>Libertarians are ultimately anti-statists. Their goddess, Libertas, is the ultimate paragon of worship. Any coercive action by one party on another is viewed as negative to the ultimate good and because the state is the ultimate coercive force it is the ultimate antithesis. They have it exactly backward, however, as liberty cannot flourish without a social order to base our lives around. It doesn&rsquo;t happen in a vacuum; it occurs when order is established and tranquility is maintained. A moral people is required; a unified nation with a shared history, race, and language unnegotiable.</p>

<p>If I didn&rsquo;t like being wet, the wetness nonsense of liquid water would always bother me, too.</p>
<p>Get my point?</p>
<p>Libertarians:Open Borders::Liquid Water:Wetness</p>
<p>And that leads me to an important point, my philosophical underpinnings which so far have governed almost every post I&rsquo;ve made on this thread. As much as Ls talk about issues relating to the size and scope of government, when you strip Ls down to the bare metal of their hard drives, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what really really matters to them.</p>
<p>The fundamental prerequisite to libertarianism is being against the notion that groups of people who number fewer than the whole of humanity and are innately related to each other somehow have fundamental collective rights because they are part of that group and for the benefit of those in it, but not for the whole of humanity and sometimes to the detriment of people outside the group.</p>
<p>If you are for that notion, then you cannot possibly be a libertarian, even if you happen to agree with other things that libertarians claim they want. If you don&rsquo;t agree with that notion, then you can be a libertarian, even though not everyone who doesn&rsquo;t agree with that notion is a libertarian, some are liberals, some are neo-cons, some are lamestream conservatives, some are communists, and so on.</p>
<p>Strangely, libertarians will give collective rights to voluntary associations of people (chess clubs, e.g.) that they won&rsquo;t to involuntary associations of particular people (tribes, ethnicities, races).</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-360820" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Ayn Rand said: &#8220;Check your premises&#8221;. This needs to be done with libertarian ideologies built on the implicit abstraction of &#8220;man&#8221; as a self-reliant young English-speaking adult of high IQ without any &#8220;uncontracted&#8221; obligations to parents or children, let alone to wider relatives or neighbors. Having studied all of Rand&rsquo;s fiction, most of her non-fiction, some of her interviews, plus two major biographies, I frankly do not think she would support either &#8220;open borders&#8221; (despite herself as an early beneficiary) today, or even the &#8220;global usury&#8221; as urged by the &#8220;kosher collective&#8221; that has inherited her name and incidentally mucked up the chance to produce &#8220;Atlas Shrugged&#8221; as a great movie.</p>

<p>I try to stay away from referencing ideas to art and fiction. Even &rsquo;1984&#8242;, as harrowing a warning as one can get, isn&rsquo;t real and leaves questions and is open to speculation. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, too many are influenced more by fiction than reality. &#8216;To Kill a Mocking Bird&rsquo; and &#8216;A Time To Kill&rsquo; are both lies masquerading as truth. </p>
<p>Not really going anywhere with this other than to say books are powerful and influential. Liberals are far ahead in their influence through fiction.</p>

<p>1. At this conference of racially minded libertarians, what was the ratio of libertarian discussion to race discussion? </p>
<p>2. Were the racially minded libertarians who attended this conference in Turkey, other than Jared Taylor, because AR is Jared Taylor and vice-versa, ever seen attending AR conferences? Did they give a standing ovation to the race-oriented speech that, e.g. J. Phillipe Rushton, gave at AR conferences when he was still living?</p>

<p>The natural tendency of capitalism is to accumulate wealth at the top, and to go through increasingly destructive economic downturns. Karl Marx pointed that out in The Communist Manifesto, written in 1847, and published the next year.</p>
<p>During the Roosevelt administration the economic policies of John Maynard Keynes counteracted this tendency by reducing the work week, instituting a minimum wage, strengthening labor unions, and raising the top tax rate. </p>
<p>Since the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 the policies of Keynes are being reversed. The tendencies recognized by Marx are again becoming apparent. The rich are getting richer as the average standard of living declines. Economic downturns are becoming deeper and longer.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-363863" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Mechanized agriculture produced an abundance, allowing food prices to drop dramatically. Marx didn&rsquo;t have a clue about *anything.* He clung to the labor theory of value which in economics is the equivalent of the flat-earth theory. He certainly didn&rsquo;t understand the first thing about the business cycle, or the role that central banks played in it. His ideas were utterly refuted by Eugen Böhm Ritter von Bawerk, Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard. I am somewhat amazed that anyone would still take that batty pamphleteer seriously. </p>
<p>Roosevelt&rsquo;s policies prolonged the Great Depression. Had he simply gotten out of the way, the panic of 1929 would have soon self-corrected, people who made bad bets would have gotten a haircut, and the economy would have soon enough returned to normal. See the works by Tomas Woods, Bob Murphy, or Thom DiLorenzo. And it wasn&rsquo;t WWII either that got us out of the Great Depression, That&rsquo;s another bit of mythology peddled to naive high school students. Robert Higgs has devastated that myth. </p>
<p>The accumulation of wealth among the top stems in large part from government intervention in the economy.. In a free society, investors and investment banks that make bad decisions would not be rescued from their own folly through bailouts, stimulus programs, and a central bank at the beck and call of Goldman Sachs with the power to conjure money out of thin air</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really think that we live in anything resembling a free market economy, do you? We live under a form of post-modern fascism.</p>

<p>Roosevelt was reelected three times because for most Americans life began to improve almost as soon as he was inaugurated. </p>
<p>There was a steady decline in unemployment, except for a year after 1937, when he made the mistake of reducing government spending. There was nearly as much economic growth during Roosevelt&rsquo;s first term as during the terms of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolrige. There was considerably more job creation.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think much of the libertarian construct even if that were true, because individual interests clash as much as they mesh (meaning we&rsquo;d have a lot of people complaining that others are violating their &#8220;rights&#8221;), but once we add the variable that some people form groups and act in group interests for their benefit and to others&rsquo; detriment, I see Libertarianism as a form of self-disarmament. I say as one who has never been a joiner that coordinated group action usually whips individual effort, and it&rsquo;s better and easier to be in a group than to strike out on one&rsquo;s own.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my litmus test:</p>
<p>1. Does the libertarian acknowledge the existence of real biologically-based differences between the races? </p>
<p>In my experience, libertarians don&rsquo;t. They say they&rsquo;re &#8220;colorblind.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. If they do acknowledge that race is real, do they then acknowledge that races have group interests and that it is right and good for them to organize to perpetuate and defend those interests? </p>
<p>In my experience, libertarians jump all over such arguments and claim that racial awareness and racially-based political organizing is a form of &#8220;evil collectivism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Show me a libertarian who&rsquo;s on board with these two fundamental principles and I&rsquo;ll be willing to give the rest of what he has to say a listen.</p>

<p>This is the second thread in two weeks here on AR about this confab of mostly irrelevant crank losers in Turkey. At best, anything they discussed there is not much relevant to our cause, at worst, most of the people there are trying to fake and cuckold their way into our nest for their own benefit and our detriment. At least the good part is that from what I read, we&rsquo;re wise to the treachery of liberTARDians, nobody is buying their game and their scam anymore. Even the article is written in a mostly critical tone.</p>
<p>On the other hand, did you know that there was a massive rally today in and around Nashville of our kind of people protesting the demographic replacement of white Dixierons via mass non-white immigration, and also the greed of plutocrats like the people that run Treason (Tyson) Foods who stand to benefit from all that cheap labor? If all you ever read was AR, you wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I can guarantee you that what Jack Ryan, Hunter Wallace and many many others did in Nashville today will be infinitely more beneficial for our cause and for the cause of good decent honest white civilization than all the empty and useless chatter that went on in Turkey.</p>
<p>I would have been there (Nashville) today if I still wasn&rsquo;t on the road trying to make a living.</p>

<p>Calm down brother, it&rsquo;s the Internet. We&rsquo;re all crank losers here.</p>
<p>Libertarianism is appealing because it is the central State which is enforcing colorblind equality and open borders. In a libertarian regime, there are only owners, tenants and trespassers. </p>
<p>That being said, Lew ditched an excellent writer, Bob Wallace, over some racial realtalk, and the Mises Institute is delusionally pro-immigrant. They weren&rsquo;t always; something happened to take things in a different direction.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d call that a distinction without a difference. All media, however deep or shallow, deal in ideas. The majority are able to survive without handouts and fundraisers because they produce a product that people want and are willing to pay for. I find it ironic if not hypocritical that Reason, the &#8220;Free Minds and Free Markets&#8221; (and, presumably, pro-capitalism) people, cannot survive in the marketplace of ideas without the aid of a nonprofit foundation.</p>
<p> Libertarians love to mock PBS and NPR and all the other quasi-government media enterprises. &#8220;Let them compete and try to survive in an open marketplace,&#8221; they chide. I would offer the same challenge to Reason.</p>

<p>Cultures, institutions, and economies all are enriched by broadening the pools of talent and human capital that they can draw from.

<p>Also, diversity&rsquo;s effects in the arts has a very similar effects on knowledge and technology, the key drivers to economic growth.

Harvard Economist George Borjas is probably the most established academic critic of immigration. But even he admits that immigrants create net benefits for the native-born and, in the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, puts this gain at $22 billion a year. Using his method of calculation and updating for more recent immigrant flows puts the number at more than $36 billion.&#8221;</p>

Liberals like to criticize firms like Wal-Mart for how little they pay their employees, but this completely ignores one whole side of the equation: Wal-Mart&rsquo;s customers. The lower that Wal-Mart can reduce their costs, the lower prices that they can charge.</p>
<p>Note that there are two ways that a person can increase their wealth: 1) make more money, or 2) spend less money. Likewise, there are two ways an economy can increase the standard of living for its citizens: 1) increase real GDP per capita, or 2) reduce prices.</p>
<p>And note, the number of Wal-Mart customers is a lot bigger than the number of their employees. Anything that reduces costs and thus prices has a similar effect. Just like with free trade, not everybody gains, but the overall amount of gain far outstrips the amount of loss simply because the number of people who benefit from lower prices is huge compared to the number of people who lose their jobs.</p>

<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>By paying their employees as little as possible Mal-Mart creates economic pressure for their competitors to do the same. Wal-Mart also drives smaller stores out of business. Thus, the negative effects of what Mal-Mart is doing extends beyond their employees. </p>
<p>A different way of doing things was introduced by Henry Ford. When he opened his first assembly line he paid twice the going rate for factory work. Business rivals of course called him a socialist. That is their term of derogation for anyone who cuts into their profit margin. </p>
<p>Ford explained what he was doing by saying, &#8220;I want my workers to be able to buy the cars they are making.</p>
<p>Increasingly, our economy is moving in two directions. Wal-Mart represents one direction. Wal-Mart hires those those who are desperate for any job they can get, and pays them as little as necessary. Microsoft hires the best computer professionals it can find, and pays what it needs to do to attract them. </p>
<p>In 1953 President Eisenhower selected Charles Erwin Wilson to be his Secretary of Defense. At the time he was President of General Motors. During the hearings for that selection Wilson said, &#8220;for years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberals derided and misquoted this statement. Nevertheless, for decades General Motors and other corporations provided people of average and below average intelligence with decent incomes. Because they were well paid, they were good consumers. </p>
<p>Now there is a race to the bottom, as corporations pay most of their employees as little as possible, while cutting pay rolls.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney embodies the new trend American capitalism is moving in. His father, George Romney, made a fortune as president of American Motors by creating cars and jobs. </p>
<p>Mitt made a bigger fortune doing&hellip;What? Can you buy something Cain Capital makes? No. You can&rsquo;t get a job there either without a fancy post graduate degree from a fancy university. Mitt Romney may have saved a few jobs for a few blue collar workers, but he did not create any. Many blue collar workers and white collar workers lost their jobs because of his business activities.</p>
<p>On Stormfront I read someone describe this kind of thing as &#8220;Jewish capitalism.&#8221; That kind of thinking is the way some white Gentiles deflect blame for twenty-first century casino capitalism away from other white Gentiles who., like Mitt Romney, belong to an increasingly predatory and Gentile plutocracy.</p>

<p>Schumpeter realized that firm failure was creative destruction.

<p> When factories close factory workers who used to have well paying union jobs find themselves competing for jobs in the service industry, like waiters, and retail sales clerks. Although these usually pay less than production jobs, they require more in the way of academic and social skills. </p>
<p>Even retail sales jobs are declining in number. Bar codes make it possible to for retail sales clerks to serve more customers faster. As a result retail sales clerks lose their jobs. Automatic check out counters also reduce the number of jobs for retail sales clerks.</p>
<p>We could reduce the work week, while increasing wages for low skill workers by strengthening labor unions and raising the minimum wages. This has been done in the past, with good results. It is not the direction the country is moving in, however.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-361869" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>As for growing inequality, the cause is not well-understood. Some economists think it has to do with technology. I suspect it has more to do with how easy it is to use money to influence the government to tilt markets to get more money.</p>
<p>- perfectlyGoodInk</p>
<p>I would say that there are three reasons for growing economic inequality. Liberals only want to talk about the first reason.</p>
<p>First, since the 1960&#8242;s the tax system has become flatter. The value of the minimum wage and unemployment compensation has lost value to inflation. Labor unions have become weaker. </p>
<p>Second, although the birth rate for those born in the United States has declined, the American population has grown because of the Immigration Reform Act of 1965. This was unpopular at the time, but it had bi partisan support. More people mean more consumers and more job applicants. By the law of supply and demand this means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits. </p>
<p>Liberals do not like to think of the second reason because they are sympathetic toward immigrants, especially if they are destitute and victims of third world tyranny.</p>
<p>Third, computer technology increases the relationship between intelligence and income. Computer technology creates opportunities for geniuses to become fabulously wealth. Bill Gates, for example, has an IQ of 160. Computer technology also reduces the economic value of the kinds of jobs most people can master. Computer technology makes automation and the shipping of jobs to low wage countries possible.</p>
<p>Liberals do not like to think of the third reason because they like to pretend that IQ tests measure nothing of value, and that IQ differences between individuals, and average differences between races are unimportant.</p>

<p>Also, technology actually increases the productivity of labor, and thus the wage. Just for labor that can utilize the technology, but that&rsquo;s always merely a question of designing a good enough user interface. Note that even very uneducated and unintelligent people these days can write e-mails, answer phones, make copies, and surf the web.</p>
<p>Of course, those who cannot use technology to boost their productivity definitely lose a competitive edge. In a meritocracy, isn&rsquo;t that as it should be?</p>

<p>Honestly, &#8220;skill sets&#8221; shouldn&rsquo;t have needed me to define it, as the term is rather self-explanatory. Your skill-set defines what you are able to provide for your employer. Assuming you are gainfully employed at a corporation, just look at the different jobs at your office and think about the ones that you wouldn&rsquo;t be qualified to do and why (you can just go up and ask your co-workers about what they do if you aren&rsquo;t sure). Alternately, just think back to the last time you looked for a job and were framing your experience on your resume in a way that would be attractive to the widest possible number of employers.</p>
<p>Economists measure benefits in a rather complex manner, but Borjas&rsquo;s methodology is standard within the field. If you are genuinely interested in learning about it, I should have time to explain it tomorrow.</p>

<p>Forgive me if the following comes across as patronizing, but I hope it will make the point crystal clear.</p>
<p>On August 5, 2012 in Wisconsin, Wade Michael Page shot and killed six people with a handgun that he legally owned. All of the deceased were of Sikh faith. Page was a Christian with no ties to Al Qaeda, but did have ties to white supremacist groups. He was born in Colorado in 1971.</p>
<p>Which of the following is a valid conclusion to draw from this event?</p>
<p>A) White people are violent animals.<br/>
B) Christians are violent animals.<br/>
C) Handgun owners are violent animals.<br/>
D) People with tattoos are violent animals.<br/>
E) People born in Colorado in 1971 are violent animals.<br/>
F) White supremacists are violent animals who hate Sikhs more than Muslims.<br/>
G) None of the above.</p>
<p>Like I said, anecdotal evidence can be used to argue anything. This is where science and statistical analysis shows its value.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-361851" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Why WOULDN&rsquo;T differences in outcomes between races indicate at least some degree of genetic differences? Particularly when such differences are so strongly pronounced and consistently expressed in a wide variety of eras, societies, and locations? Canada never had slavery, pre-1800s black Africa was not colonized, Ethiopia / Liberia / Haiti have long histories as independent, black cities in America and elsewhere have had near absolute power over their own affairs for generations now, and in all cases the results are the same - anarchic violence, tyrannical thuggery, pervasive corruption and incompetence, collapse or non-existence of physical and cultural infrastructure, etc.</p>
<p>Any benefit to be found by living in close quarters with such a people is overwhelmingly, crushingly outweighed by the neighborhood-wrecking, school-wrecking, city-wrecking, nation-wrecking costs.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t remotely like islanders specializing in fishing while plainsmen specialize in wheat-growing, and both benefiting from contact, trade, and division of labor.</p>
<p>Race isn&rsquo;t &#8220;skin color&#8221; - if Whoopi Goldberg or Jay-Z were an albino she or he would still be heavily black and obviously so at a glance. Nor is it skin-deep, it&rsquo;s bone-deep - forensic anthropologists can identify skeletal remains by race. Blacks have smaller craniums, brains, and lower intelligence as a direct result.</p>

<p>But they aren&rsquo;t. There are pros and cons to living in a city, including higher crime and pollution, but on the net, more and more people find the pros to outweigh the cons as our society continually becomes more urbanized. Whether urbanization is a good thing is certainly arguable, as you point out below, but that it is happening seems to cast doubt on your claim.</p>
<p>As for the science of race, this is outside my area of expertise, but I believe Bamshad and Olson did genetic work that found that genetic similarities were more likely to be among different people spread all over the world than within geographically concentrated groups.</p>
<p>Still, I am arguing that, even if there were racial differences in ability (which I don&rsquo;t think is settled), comparative advantage argues in favor of more exchanges and interaction, not less. Geographical nearness would facilitate this, and the growth in our cities seems to bear this out.</p>

Science does not make conclusions based on anecdotal evidence, nor assume that correlation means causation (lest you believe that global temperatures are tied to a decrease in pirates or that high debt causes low growth rates).</p>
<p>In addition to reverse causality, correlation between two variables can also be a result of a third variable. In this case, that obvious third variable is income. Poor people are more likely to commit crimes.</p>
<p>If there is a study that indicates race and crime are still correlated AFTER controlling for income, I would be interested in reading it. If this movement&rsquo;s claim about science is true, one would expect this to be seen as a reasonable request (especially since I myself was requested to furnish evidence regarding a claim that I made).</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-365691" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Well, I finally found your own source for you. Glayde Whitney (1995), &#8220;Ideology and Censorship in behavior genetics.&#8221; It&rsquo;s not a study. It&rsquo;s a talk that he gave to the Behavior Genetics Association, later reprinted in Mankind Quarterly.</p>
<p>As I have stated elsewhere, the problem with merely finding correlation between two variables is that it does not rule out the possibility of reverse causality (the problem with Reinhart &amp; Rogoff&rsquo;s debt and growth paper) or that there is a third variable affecting both.</p>
<p>To address this, one can use regression techniques to focus on two variables, controlling for the other variables that might muddy the waters (note, the results are not nearly as definitive as controlling for variables in a laboratory, but note that social sciences must make do with natural experiments and clean the data as best they can). There are fairly standard methods available to do so, but Whitney does not make use of them and instead simply evades the issue of such other variables by merely claiming ignorance of any other that could better explain the finding.</p>
<p>In contrast, Morgan Kelly (2000) in &#8220;Inequality and Crime&#8221; looked at the correlation between income inequality and crime and did indeed control for race and other variables, and found that, &#8220;for violent crime the impact of inequality is large, even after controlling for the effects of poverty, race, and family composition.&#8221;</p>
<p>I will refrain from commenting on other issues related to Whitney and his talk.</p>

<p>Economic systems come and go, they&rsquo;re a dime a dozen. I am of the belief that if we get race right, economics will take care of themselves. IOW, the various white tribes of the world will, under the security of ethnostates for every one of them, find the right economic system to suit their needs. Whether it&rsquo;s capitalism, socialism, some combination of the two, or some paradigm that has yet to be invented. Yes, sometimes our people will get it wrong, but it is possible to fix and repair wrong economic policies with right ones. In the recent past, even Sweden discovered it was too socialist, and made adjustments. But I also know that there will be one day soon when (real) Swedes will rue the day they let the first non-white Muslim African into their country.</p>
<p>But if we lose on race, we lose everything. That should be AR&rsquo;s goal, I think, to help us win on race.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-361859" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>And there&rsquo;s yet another point.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m about to say is a mistake in judgment I made until recently. People hear or read &#8220;libertarian&#8221; and still think it refers to someone whose paramount concerns are the size and scope of government.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, one of the many life lessons pounded into my head constantly was that words were cheaper than dirt, that actions have consequences, and to watch people&rsquo;s feet, not their mouths.</p>
<p>I know what libertarian says, and I also know what libertarian does. If libertarians were so concerned about the size and scope of government, then why do &#8220;libertarians&#8221; like Paul Ryan seem to be okay with a budget deal that enshrines ObamaDontCare into law &#8220;forever?&#8221; Why did Paul Ryan&rsquo;s own budget proposals before now maybe balance the Federal budget in 20-30 years? School vouchers and the whole school choice movement weren&rsquo;t hatched by libertarians, but they sure have taken up the mantle today. Someone concerned about the size and scope of government wouldn&rsquo;t approve of the concept of taking money away from me to give to anyone to pay for school tuition. So why do many &#8220;libertarians,&#8221; e.g. John Stossel, approve?</p>
<p>Because libertarian mouths are about the size and scope of government. Libertarian feet are about open borders, no borders, zero immigration control and race denial and egalitarianism all the way.</p>
<p>Therefore, I assess the essence of libertarianism as denying race. All else is inconsequential talk. Like I said elsewhere in this thread, if you think that white people have the collective right to organize and lobby openly for their own best racial interests, then you are by definition not a libertarian and can never be. &#8220;Libertarian racialist&#8221; is an oxymoron.</p>

When an epsilon-minus semi-moron named Gray Davis was Governor of California, he presided over a similar debacle. The wholesale market for electricity had been deregulated, but the consumer/retail market had been capped at some maximum amount that other epsilon-minuses assumed would never be met. Well, the wholesale price exceeded the retail cap, and rather than just let the producers stop delivering energy to California until the market sorted it out, Mr. Davis simply used the $30B surplus in the Calif treasury, plus a whole bunch more, to buy the energy high and sell it low. Of course, he begged people to conserve, which did about as much good as you might expect. When California was giving away free (well, very cheap) electricity, there was a run on electricity, and the state went from having the largest surplus ever in the history of any state to the largest deficit.<br/>
Libertarians skewered Davis, and his predecessors, for halfway-deregulating a market. They should do the same for the open-border epsilon-minuses.<br/>
If we weren&rsquo;t giving away all this stuff of value (including citizenship and anchor-baby rights!!?!) we could put two guys in lawn chairs on the border, and no one would try to cross.</p>

If anything, as this article suggests in several places, the anti-statism of libertarianism inclines it to conflict with the right of states to police their borders. Some libertarians are race realist, some race realists are libertarian. Some socialists are race realist, some race realists are socialists. Empirically, there might be closer connections between one pair of views than with the other pair, but there&rsquo;s no necessary connection.</p>

Even if Libertarianism found itself governing the USA it would likely fail. I don&rsquo;t think it would work even if a majority of people could agree to try it, which they never would.

The people who gain from trade and immigration (all consumers) are many, and benefit less.</p>
<p>Thus, the ones who are hurt are the ones more likely to be political active about the issue. Thus, just like the level of trade, the current allowed rate of immigration is likely to be far lower than what is best for the country.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-362360" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The main gain from immigration is not just human capital. Indeed, immigration that consists of just unskilled labor is a benefit because it lowers the cost of all goods produced by unskilled labor. As I noted with the Wal-Mart example in another comment, this hurts just the American workers with no skills, but it helps ALL American consumers.</p>
<p>As with trade, the key is comparative advantage. To benefit from trade, what you need is a trading partner with different strengths and weaknesses, and the same applies to immigration. For a country to benefit the most from immigration, you want immigrants to have different strengths and weaknesses than the native populace (and as comparative advantage teaches us, it does not even matter if they have an absolute advantage or an absolute disadvantage at everything   &mdash;   the key is a difference in relative strengths).</p>
<p>Indeed, all estimates of the economic impact of immigration that I have seen are positive. As I mentioned in another comment, economist Ben Powell cites a Borjas work critical of immigration which admits the net effect is a benefit of $22 billion a year. The National Academy of Sciences puts the benefit of $10 billion a year (note, this is a much older study). And the U.S. Council of Economic Advisors estimates a gain of $30 billion per year.</p>
<p>It is very astute for you to point out that there are externalities. However, the empirical data is decidedly mixed. Butcher and Piehl (1998), examined over 40 cities in the 1980s and found no impact on crime from immigration. Bianchi, Buananno, and Pinotti (2012) found similar results regarding immigration into Italy. Borjas (1998) found contradictory evidence where displaced native workers became more likely to commit crimes (although note that this finding probably doesn&rsquo;t exactly help your cause much). And Wadsorth (2010) found indeterminate results, where crime could increase or decrease from immigration.</p>
<p>And as I have noted in a comment elsewhere, there are also positive externalities from diversity, as diverse groups tend to be more creative. This is a boost in all the arts (art, music, film, food), but note that every field and every endeavor involves a great deal of problem-solving, where creativity is key.</p>

I was referring to the overall European unemployment rate, which stands at 12% right now. More importantly, it has historically been higher than that of the U.S. for decades.</p>
<p>I agree that inequality is increasing, and I already mentioned that many economists believe technology is one culprit. I am contesting with your belief that technology that increases productivity of labor costs jobs in the aggregate. This seems to indicate a model in your head of jobs being commodity of which there is a fixed amount, what economics calls &#8220;the lump of labor fallacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note that in 1920, unemployment was 5.2%. Since that time, we have seen a number of inventions: the traffic signal (putting a lot of cops out of work), the photocopier (putting human transcribers out of work), the microwave oven, the calculator, the personal computer, spreadsheet software, etc. Not to mention that, in the 70s, women entered the workplace in droves and there have been millions of immigrants.</p>
<p>If jobs were a commodity in fixed supply, all of these changes should have permanently increased the unemployment rate, but in 1988, it was 5.5%, and in 2000, it was 4.0%. It&rsquo;s 7.3% now, but note that we are still recovering from a recession. </p>
<p>And no, recoveries are not getting longer and longer. The 2001 and 1990 recessions lasted only 9 months (the average since 1900 is 14.4 months), and the one in 1981 lasted just 6. The reason this one is lasting so long will be argued for a while, but I think the Keynesian school has the best explanation. The government usually fights recessions by lowering interest rates, which increases spending and investment. That doesn&rsquo;t work anymore when interest rates hit 0, and this is what they call a liquidity trap.</p>

I was perfectly fine with keeping comments brief and concise instead using the obviously unwieldy academic style of citing sources, but remember, you were the one here who specifically asked for supporting evidence.</p>
<p>Indeed, I was under the impression that your movement claims it is not a racist one because it is based on science. If this claim were true, one would have expected participants here to be more versed on the claimed scientific foundations of their argument and to better understand the economic implications of it (never mind being more receptive to a science-based argument).</p>
<p>Of course, I myself didn&rsquo;t actually expect any of that, but I still think it was worthwhile to check. Like I said, I try to give people the benefit of the doubt. Sometimes they don&rsquo;t deserve it, but you never know unless you give them a chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the 1870s and 1880s, the U.S. economy rose at the fastest rate in its history, with real wages, wealth, GDP, and capital formation all increasing rapidly.[11] For example, between 1865 and 1898, the output of wheat increased by 256%, corn by 222%, coal by 800% and miles of railway track by 567%.[12] Thick national networks for transportation and communication were created. The corporation became the dominant form of business organization, and a scientific management revolution transformed business operations. By the beginning of the 20th century, per capita income and industrial production in the United States led the world, with per capita incomes double that of Germany or France, and 50% higher than Britain.[13] The businessmen of the Second Industrial Revolution created industrial towns and cities in the Northeast with new factories, and hired an ethnically diverse industrial working class, many of them new immigrants from Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Political Correctness is a Cultural Code. You said nothing of culture. You didn&rsquo;t address it in the least. You don&rsquo;t understand it. Political Correctness is evident in Libertarians when they&rsquo;re screaming NEOCON!!1111one every time someone disagrees. It&rsquo;s the indoctrination which labels anyone who disagrees with their Cult as a bugbear just like Liberals.</p>
<p>Liberals and Libertarians don&rsquo;t disagree on the Cultural Codes of Political Correctness, they disagree on the litigation. Libertarians enforce them exclusively through Culture, which ends up being Liberal anyway. Just because the enforcement varies doesn&rsquo;t mean the behavior varies. Libertarians will chase away those &#8220;Evil, racist, NEOCONS!!!111one&#8221; and &#8220;rednecks&#8221; as fast as a Liberal.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-363961" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Like most intellectual pursuits, they are fine in theory and may provide benefits beyond constipated conjecture among intellectual elites capable of comprehending the topic(s) and the impact(s). Concordantly, immigration, regardless of its merits/costs is unimportant hyperbole. Voting is the central problem. Men are not all intellectually gifted, nor will they necessarily possess the rudiments of intellect. Therein lies problem for every political and societal debate that arises. That no restrictions, nor minimum qualifications exist for citizens to exercise the voting franchise, assures the weak of mind will be corraled by the commonality of their complaints and used to sequester power in the hands of those that promise them relief to their several complaints. Importantly, when the natural controls that restrict breeding are removed/palliated, and the weak minded are encouraged to breed, an equation of destruction is set in motion.<br/>
Weak in mind almost always equates to a lower income and standard of living. Problem solving for the weak minded is problematic and often focuses upon immediate gratification - at the expense of long term usefulness. The weak minded are typically the most suceptible to promises of relief that excuse their incompetence, and, importantly, punishes those more affluent than they. If the relief can be packaged with inflicting suffering and monetary losses upon their bettors, the weak minded will eagerly provide their vote. Envy, jealousy, and the hate the former two foster, are inseparable and omniscient among the dull witted. Emotions replace reason. Emotions frame each issue and drive the actions of the dullard. There is a correlate between emotions and reason that approaches zero-sum. When the former is prevalent, the latter is limited - and vice versa. The dullard knows better than anyone else the limits of their minds. Consequently, violence and force are adopted when the absence of intellect fails to provide peaceful solutions and emotions bolster their frustrations. Seeing their bettors suffer provides the dullard immediate gratification and assuages their convoluted value system - projecting suffering will teach the bettor what life is like for the dull witted/low income strata. Again, obtaining emotional gratification trumps reason. Sadly, more often than not, satisfying emotions provides the less optimal solution set. When political arguments are specifically crafted to inflame emotions and make excuses for incompetence/failures, it is a winning message. The absence of long term thinking keeps the dullard blind to the consequences of their votes. WIth unrestricted/rewarded breeding, the numbers of dull witted increase as do their demands upon society/government. Nefariously, the number of dullard votes rise in proportion to their numbers. The combination of factors assures only one outcome - death of the society and form of government that endorses and subsidizes the creation of an ignorant voting majority. All other issues are moot.</p>

<p>Libertarians believe in the right of free association, so it&rsquo;s fine when individuals wish to move wherever they wish, whether it be diverse or homogenous.

I oppose this, as I view it as a negative side-effect of how our political system works (that tariffs are a similar case). Note, imposing personal preferences is rather different from arguing for/against a policy based upon its projected effects upon the country, or arguing from principles that this country was founded upon, like liberty and justice.</p>
<p>Yes, there are many libertarians who advocate open borders (per the original article above). I tend to be less ideological and more pragmatic, supporting policies that would not be identified as strictly libertarian, such as pollution taxes, school vouchers, expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. As I mentioned elsewhere on this thread, I do support some minimal border controls, albeit I think it should be less than what we have now.</p>
<p>And yes, a libertarian utopia in America is about as unlikely as a &#8220;race realist&#8221; utopia in America. I see this as little reason to stop openly arguing in favor of what I support and against what I oppose.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-365966" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Ford is literally used as the textbook example of the efficiency wage. For example, N. Gregory Mankiw&rsquo;s _Principles of Economics_, 6th edition on page 646: &#8220;In 1914, Ford introduced another innovation: the $5 workday&hellip; about twice the going wage&hellip;. When the new $5-a-day wage was announced, long lines of job seekers formed outside the Ford factories.&#8221; The text also claims that productivity increased and turnover fell after he implemented the change.</p>
<p>In Snowdon and Vane&rsquo;s _Modern Macroeconomics_, they quantify the effect a little more on page 394: &#8220;The result of Ford&rsquo;s new wage policy was a dramatic reduction in absenteeism (down 75 per cent), reduced turnover (down 87 per cent), a massive improvement in productivity (30 per cent), a reduction in the price of the Model T Ford, and an increase in profits. It appears that Ford was one of the first entrepreneurs to apply efficiency wage theory. Later, Henry Ford described the decision to pay his workers $5 per day as &lsquo;one of the finest cost cutting moves we ever made&rsquo; (see Meyer, 1981; Raff and Summers, 1987).&#8221;</p>
<p>Note, there is disagreement about Ford&rsquo;s actual intentions, of course. For example, Jason Taylor argues he meant to boost aggregate demand.</p>
