And how we teach martial arts.</div><!--/.intro-paragraph-->

	                	<p>Racially conscious whites tend to think our education problem is mainly a demographic problem, and that wide-spread school failure merely proves that what we say about race and immigration is right. Our problem is far larger.</p>
<p>Education has two goals. It leads to economic and scientific progress, but it also instills morals and values in the generation that will succeed the current one. When most people think of education, they think only of the first goal. Except for left-wing novelties such as women&rsquo;s studies and Chicano studies, virtually every college class is justified in terms of dollars and cents.</p>
<p>Philosophers, however, teach that the primary purpose of education is to gain the wisdom and understanding that form a child into an adult with morals and a properly ordered set of values. Practical knowledge is important, but a society without wisdom and understanding will decline.</p>
<div id="attachment_104502" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AristotleBustOfHomer.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104502" alt="Aristotle noted that &quot;Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.&quot;" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AristotleBustOfHomer.jpg" width="600" height="593"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Aristotle noted that &#8220;Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>The trouble is that schools do teach values: the values of the Left. This is almost never acknowledged, but it is pervasive. From their earliest school years, our children absorb values that are the opposite of our own, and this only hastens our decline.</p>
<p>What do students think of their own education? I am a high-school Latin teacher. Almost the only reasons students ever give for wanting to study Latin are these: It will build vocabulary, which will help on the SAT or ACT test; it will help them understand the roots of words, which will be useful in law school or medical school; or it will impress college admissions committees. None of my students ever says that studying Latin will help him understand his ancestors or become like them.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am being unfair to my students, because I did not start studying Latin until I was in college, and though I had always wanted to learn it, I&rsquo;m not sure I could have explained why. My romance with Latin was associated with Medieval Catholicism and European culture &mdash; more specifically, kingdoms, hierarchy, and pan-European understanding. To me, Latin meant bravery, commitment, loyalty, and even quaintness and simplicity.</p>
<p>I remember the sense of mystery that hearing a Latin Mass would evoke, or the intense feeling of belonging and nostalgia every time I watched Mel Gibson&rsquo;s character speak in Latin in the movie <i>Braveheart</i>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TridentineMass.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-104501" alt="TridentineMass" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TridentineMass.jpg" width="600" height="402"/></a></p>
<p>I cannot always prove intellectually that what I believe is right, but I have the deepest sense, or feeling, that it is. And I know the value of preserving what was once central to our culture. Of course, the values I learned as a student were different from those who are &ldquo;educated&rdquo; by the system. I was homeschooled by traditionalist Catholic parents.</p>
<p>White students do not have teachers and mentors who will instill in them what they must know to rescue civilization. Instead, they are taught the value of every civilization but their own. Their teachers tell them they must not simply tolerate the non-Western influences that have already infiltrated our societies; they must embrace them as superior, or at least equal, to our own.</p>
<p>And this brings me to the martial arts. In Western culture, martial arts were, as the etymology suggests, the arts of Mars, the god of war. But in the Greco-Roman pantheon, Mars was not a very well-liked or even well-respected god. He reveled in bloodshed and destruction. He liked fighting for its own sake &mdash; he needed no reason or cause. Of course, warriors could be great leaders in the Western tradition, but the martial arts were seen as destructive and terrible. And, as we see in <i>The Iliad</i> &mdash; that marvelous but now neglected work of Western literature &mdash; physical strength was an integral part of being a good fighter, even if it wasn&rsquo;t the most important.</p>
<p>Today, Asia has almost completely usurped our martial tradition, and Asian martial arts come with an assumption that Asian culture &mdash; whatever that really is &mdash; is superior to Western culture. People who study judo or Tae Kwon Do or karate wear &ldquo;gis&rdquo; and talk about &ldquo;masters&rdquo; and &ldquo;dojos.&rdquo; It is all about some mysterious system with ceremony and decorum. An obsession with Asian-ness is standard for any American who becomes a &ldquo;sensei.&rdquo; The students attribute deep wisdom to the &ldquo;master,&rdquo; who is likely to believe that anyone who uses strength to win a fight is a brute.</p>
<p>The Western view is different. We proudly used war and fighting to make our boys into men, but we never pretended that a Kung-Fu-Panda-type master of some mysterious cult was the wisest man in the world. In our tradition, a martial art was a technical skill used for fighting. We Westerners used everything at our disposal, whether it was technique, armor, weaponry, strategy, or strength. We were always looking for new ways to improve the efficiency and success of our fighting men.</p>
<p>And we have always admired strength for its own sake. We admire &ldquo;huge Achilles,&rdquo; who wielded a spear that no one else could handle. We admire Ajax, also described as huge &mdash; the &ldquo;bulwark of the Achaeans.&rdquo; We respect Hector&rsquo;s bravery in combat, even if he was sometimes outmatched. We understand the reality of fighting; we realize that it is not a flashy, drawn-out set of &ldquo;moves&rdquo; that trick and defeat an enemy. Real combat is death in a few devastating blows.</p>
<div id="attachment_104515" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ajax.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104515" alt="Ajax, &quot;bulwark of the Achaeans.&quot;" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ajax.jpg" width="500" height="425"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ajax, &#8220;bulwark of the Achaeans.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>The most useful arts in hand-to-hand combat with no weapons are rarely very Asian. Boxing and wrestling are entirely Western, and of central importance in mixed martial arts (MMA). Jiu-jitsu, which is arguably the most important martial art in MMA, did start in Japan, but it took on a vastly different form when it got to Brazil. Brazilians (and, increasingly, Americans) have since developed the art to such an extent that, in my opinion, it can hardly be called Asian. A thoroughly English name for jiu-jitsu would simply be &#8220;submission grappling.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a way, it is something we&rsquo;ve always had. I remember the fights I used to have as a kid with my brother. We had certain unspoken ground rules that we rarely broke, which were meant to keep fights from being too destructive. Much of our fighting came down to grappling. We didn&rsquo;t know it was called that, but that&rsquo;s what it was.</p>
<p>Finally, a big problem with the thoroughly Asian martial arts is that they are useless. They are easily overcome in a fight, even by an untrained opponent. And yet, the business of teaching these &#8220;arts&#8221; is huge. People make a living teaching them in almost every city in the country. Jiu-jitsu and MMA gyms, on the other hand, are rarely profitable enterprises &mdash; although that is changing. The quintessentially Asian martial arts have hindered the progress of the ones that work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gEDaCIDvj6I" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Con-man Asian &#8220;master&#8221; unmasked.</p>
<p>We Westerners have always had an interest in the exotic, but we should keep such interests at bay lest we lose our competitive edge. We should fight like the Greeks: We should value what&rsquo;s useful and develop our skills continuously. The desire to become better, not the subtle distinctions between Western and Eastern martial arts, is what makes the West fundamentally different from the East. Karate and Tae Kwon Do, for example, never develop or change. They are stagnant and therefore useless.</p>
<p>Asian martial arts are certainly not the only example of ordinary Americans trying to substitute a make-believe culture for their own. One was the fetish for a kind of westernized Hinduism in the 1960s and 1970s. Con-man swamis and gurus swarmed across the country, peddling chanting and meditation, and it was not just rock stars who went on pilgrimages to ashrams. Fortunately, that insanity waned but we still absorb the assumption that everything valuable ultimately came from some non-white or non-Indo-European people, and this justifies ignoring our history and culture. We must always be wary of any influence that glorifies a foreign practice over our own.</p>
<p>Consider the 90-percent-white America in the 1960s. It was not simply a time for marches, protests, and speeches. These things were inspired by a new set of values and beliefs, which were framed in terms of sex, drugs, music, freedom, and revolt against one&rsquo;s own culture. Young people passively accepted the civil rights movement because they were too brainwashed by the media to recognize it for what it was. Some actively embraced it, if only to shock their parents.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HippyBus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-104517" alt="HippyBus" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HippyBus.jpg" width="600" height="447"/></a></p>
<p>Either way, they should have been against a wholesale rejection of their own people, their nation, their religion, their culture, and their race &mdash; but they weren&rsquo;t. They threw out their parents&rsquo; system of beliefs as soon as a trendy new one came along. Would it be that easy to convert the Middle East from their culture? At some point in our history, we stopped being educated properly. This is why it was so easy to convince us to drink poison.</p>
<p>We must therefore take a two-pronged approach to solving our education problem. Of course we must continue to preach a solution &mdash; our solution &mdash; to the race problem, but we must also fill the voids that make other cultures seem so interesting and valuable.</p>
<p>If these voids are filled, people will stop focusing so much on the imagined benefits of multiculturalism. They will understand that non-white, non-European people cannot participate fully in our culture. They will realize that our culture is not only different from theirs, but that our culture actually exists. Martial arts can be a way to reintroduce our own culture to our people. Westerners who love their own country will support leaders who promote what they have come to love again, and so can we begin to heal our wounds.</p>

<p>- Matt Vollmer, American Renaissance, June 13, 2013</p>
<p>As a teenager I studied Tang Soo Do from Ki Whang Kim. Tang Soo Do is a Korean style of karate. Ki Whang Kim was one of the most charismatic people I have ever known.</p>
<p>Joe Lewis - not that Joe Lewis, but a karate tournament champion by the same name -once said, &#8220;Ki Whang Kim trained the best fighters in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>I doubt he was thinking about me.  <img src="../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley"/>  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kim Studio did train several tournament champions, including one who defeated Joe Lewis. My experience with Kim Studio is one of the reasons I appreciate Oriental culture and the Oriental people.</p>
<p>Over the years I have become skeptical of some of the things we were taught at Kim Studio. Nevertheless, a friend of mine got into a fight with two bullies after only six months of training. He defeated them both after a few minutes.</p>

<p>In jui jitsu one is trained to get one&rsquo;s opponent into a painful arm or leg lock what will make him want to stop fighting. In Western wrestling one is trained to pin his opponent&rsquo;s shoulders to the mat for three seconds. That will not achieve anything in a street fight.</p>

<p>In a fight, a wrestler will not attempt to pin his opponent&rsquo;s shoulders to the mat (it&rsquo;s momentary by the way, not 3 seconds, you&rsquo;ve been watching WWF).  In a fight, a wrestler will pick his opponent up and slam him to the ground (on concrete this would be fatal) or take him down and pound on him.  </p>
<p>Any one who enters MMA today without a deep knowledge of wrestling is defeated quickly, as was shown when the UFC first began.</p>

<p>- Matt Vollmer, American Renaissance, June 13, 2013</p>
<p>Homer&rsquo;s Iliad, and Greek tragedies dealing with the Trojan War, did not take the side of Greece in the Trojan War, as we might expect. They portrayed it as a tragically futile conflict between morally equivalent powers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Trojan Women,&#8221; by  Euripides, presents the plight of the Trojan women and children who survived the Trojan War after all the men had been killed by Greeks. </p>
<p>Euripides was an Athenian. Writing this play was an act of courage, because soldiers of Athens had recently sacked a city, killing all of the men, and taking the women as concubines. &#8220;The Trojan Women&#8221; has been called the beginning of anti war literature. </p>
<p>The greatest writings of ancient Greece were not the indoctrinations into nationalism that Matt Vollmer seems to be advocating.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-292659" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>A few years back, after believing for my entire life that my father&rsquo;s side of the family came from Germany (my paternal grandfather was born in Bonn), I discovered the ultimate source of the line came from Norway; my last name means &#8220;guard&#8221; in Old Norse.  This led me to further explore my Norse roots, which had always had a special attraction for me even though I didn&rsquo;t yet know why. In college I picked up E.V. Gordon&rsquo;s &#8220;Introduction to Old Norse&#8221; (1924) and try to imagine this passage written today:<br/>
.<br/>
<i>While the study of Old Norse literature has not been entirely neglected in England, there are many reasons why it should be better known and receive a more important place in our scheme of education.  In Old Norse literature the tastes and ideals of the Germanic race found their most vital expression, and if we would understand our own culture we ought to know this literature; the tastes and ideals embodied in it are still part of our racial heritage.  We have still, fortunately, some part of the <b>cool rationalism</b> and <b>heroic obstinacy</b> which the sagas prove to be characteristic of our Germanic forefathers.</i><br/>
.<br/>
It&rsquo;s this same Fighting Northern Spirit that Tolkien explored in his writings, taking the best virtues of our pagan ancestors (courage, and even laughter, in the face of danger; supreme self-confidence, and personal honor) and tempering them with Christian ideals.  His protagonists are presented in a sort of Limbo, a pre-Christian world where the good had no glimmering yet of salvation, yet soldiered on without it.  (Even as an atheist I feel this in my blood.)<br/>
.<br/>
This vision of ourselves, which an astonishing number of Whites respond to, could be even more vital - more vital to our ultimate survival as Whites - than the classical martial ideals Mr. Vollmer writes about above.</p>

.<br/>
Any fighting style has the potential to overcome another. It all depends on how well an individual can utilize any particular style/sytem (there are definitely particular affinities for individuals within certain styles that give them accelerated competence and advantages vs other styles) and also their level of committent or training. I have a hard time believing that someone who has trained in Kung-Fu for 10 years is going to get wrecked by an MMA who has trained for 5.<br/>
.<br/>
Arts such as Kung-Fu (Gung-Fu) and Tai-Chi are considered internal martial arts. Personally, I have trained in Tai-Chi, one-on-one with a Master for a number of years, and found it to be very effective (for me). All around, it is a set of excercises that teach relaxation while significantly increasing balance, muscle tone, and (heightened) awareness/sensitivity, both of your body and your environment. The martial aspect in Tai-Chi is more of a side effect as the focus is on relaxation and sensitivity to your own body, and/or opponent. Kung-Fu is similar, but directly focused on the martial training and conditiong for tone and strength,<br/>
.<br/>
All in all, both aim to train you to fight extremely effectively in a passive and relaxed mental state.<br/>
.<br/>
East vs West, though.. Eastern Martial Arts tend to teach finesse and grace with victory by application of refined techniques, while Western tends to apply some technique, but overall brute strength and force are the focus.<br/>
.<br/>
Oddly enough, though, dead center (Israel) develpoed a system (Krav-Maga) that is a very good balance of both. I&rsquo;ve seen some exhibitions of that system that put a knot in my throat.</p>

A number of years ago I read an article in a martial arts magazine that said that Kung Fu and karate stylists do not usually win mixed martial arts contests. </p>
<p>A problem with karate training, and I believe with Kung Fu also, is that in free sparing one is taught to pull punches and kicks. During the 1970&#8242;s protective equipment was invented for full contact sparing, but it does not seem to be widely used.</p>
<p>Free sparing does not build the power one needs to make a technique effective. Also, it teaches bad habits. I have heard of karate students who got into fights and who continued to pull their punches and kicks out of habit.</p>

Plus, the ads in Kung Fu Magazine are typically like: &#8220;buy this new video and see how to train at home, with no equipment, to become able to defeat any man in just three days!&#8221;.</p>
<p>And protection for full contact is used, allright! Especially in what is called cloed-door schools. Why? Because in some cases, without it, you would just die right there.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t waste your time with such magazines.</p>
<p>And if the sport of MMA is so effective in real combat, then I suppose the United States Marine Corps Special Force should fire their qualified instructors and hire former MMA champs like that loud mouth Bas Rutten to train their personnel&hellip;? What do you think, John?</p>

<p>Whites just aren&rsquo;t the best fighters or athletes. No amount of Tkwodeo will convince people otherwies. Enshrining violence and sports as america&rsquo;s greatest pastimes hasn&rsquo;t really helped white numbers. It&rsquo;s created a &#8216;idiocracy&rsquo; type culture. </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, many white defeats in boxing are not due to power, skill, or anything other than the fact that white people have thin skin above their eyes. It&rsquo;s easy to cause a cut there which bleeds profusely, thus ending a fight.</p>

Boxing has always been a poor man&rsquo;s sport and way out of poverty and the coils of the working class. I know of only a couple of leading boxers who had college degrees. One was a black heavyweight named James &#8220;Bonecrusher&#8221; Smith who held a championship belt in the 1980s. Carl &#8220;The Truth&#8221; Williams, who was a contender during the 1980s may have had a degree, or I at least seem to recall a report of such. Probably, there have been a few more, but I doubt there have been many. Hispanic lower weight champion boxer Juan Diaz retired in 2010 to attend law school, after earning a bachelors degree while also boxing professionally. Current heavyweight belt holder Vitali Klitschko hold a Ph.D. degree in sports science from a Ukranian university. His degree probably is equivalent to a U.S. Ph.D. in education. But these are not the norm in boxing.</p>
<p>You could compare that to MMA and even professional wrestling, where there likely are many participants with college degrees. I don&rsquo;t think degrees are the norm in any kind of professional fighting or fighting exhibition, but no doubt they are not anywhere near as rare as they are in boxing.</p>

It&rsquo;s a very long, very complicated story dating from the abolition of grammar schools in the 1960s, and we now have a significant &#8220;white&#8221; underclass, urban and rural.  Poor whites were described some years ago even by a leading official educationist as &#8220;cultural ghosts&#8221; within the new polyethnic morass. I have a BBC &#8220;multicultural education&#8221; handbook from the 1970s which favorably quotes the assertion that the English language itself is racist!  Parental controls among Chinese, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims help to protect their own children from the ravages to the &#8220;sex, drugs &amp; rap&#8221; Miley Cyrus T(een)shirt &#8220;culture&#8221;, which is reducing our own youth to a semi-literate mindless mush, susceptible to addictive brain poisoning and sexually transmitted diseases.  There are many ways to kill and cat, and various methods, even apparently contrary ones, have been and are being used to destroy the future of English-speaking white people.</p>

You can&rsquo;t be a mentally tough leader if you&rsquo;re physically weak.  Looking around at a gun show or an NRA meeting, there&rsquo;s a lot of fat, out of shape white guys.  It would be a lot better for those guys to spend an hour less per week on web forums and an hour more per week running or walking or lifting.  Also, I get angry every time I see another article about another boatload of Somalis, another gang rape, another panderer.  I channel that anger into running a bit faster or further, lifting a bit more, or studying a bit more.  Channel your anger into strength.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out something which is very rarely discussed on these forums.  Not only should we be in better shape, but we should be better dressed.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean following the fashions.  It means wearing clothes that are neat, fit properly (not baggy, not tight), and that show confidence.  It means shirts with collars, neat jeans or slacks, leather shoes or good-condition athletic shoes.  It also means a good haircut and a shave.  <i>All of this matters</i> because it shows confidence and leadership.  There&rsquo;s a reason the military puts such emphasis on personal grooming and neat attire.  We need to do the same in our daily lives. </p>
<p>I want to stop seeing overweight white guys at gun events.  I want to start seeing more fit, confident looking white guys with a steady look to them.  I want to see them with fitting clothing, good condition shoes, haircuts and shaves.</p>
<p>If anyone reading this post feels offended, good.  Put down the spaghetti, go for a run, and get some professional looking clothes.</p>

The old Latin saying, &#8216;Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi&rsquo; applies to culture, as much as it does to cult. Now Rome, no longer the &#8216;semper edeam&rsquo; she once was, gave a sop to traditionalists with the &#8216;revisions of 2010&#8242; and then, the New Guy says, &#8220;We&rsquo;re all saved,&#8221; implicitly affirming universalism! The Rot of VII falls not far from the tree. </p>
<p>Cultural Restoration will only come when we abandon that which has not worked these last fifty years, and return &#8216;ad fontes&rsquo; - to the patriarchal, patristic, Trinitarian, Catholicism of Orthodoxy, prior to the West&rsquo;s defection, ca. 1054 A.D.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-293429" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It surprises me to see the various more traditional Asian martial arts being praised on this forum. I can only assume that this is because many of you don&rsquo;t know anything about fighting, which is in part what Mr. Vollmer seemed to be talking about. Many of you have literally proven his point that Western culture is not taught to Westerners.</p>
<p>The fact is that, of the top fighters in the UFC, very few of them make serious attempts to integrate karate or Tae Kwon Do into their strategies. Do they use a few strikes from these martial arts every now and then? Sure. Do they knock their opponents out with these strikes every now and then? Sure. But the best UFC fighters tend to focus on kickboxing/Muay Thai, boxing, wrestling, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). The best UFC fighters are experts at these aforementioned four or five. They are not necessarily experts at karate or Tae Kwon Do. The latter two, for example, are basically optional-a fighter can choose to spend his time studying them or choose not to. BJJ is not optional. If a fighter chooses not to study BJJ, his opponent will immediately take him to the ground and submit him.</p>
<p>In fact, you have to be a special kind of fighter to even be able to use Tae Kwon Do. The very stance used in Tae Kwon Do is very easily attacked and defeated by boxers and wrestlers (boxers from a striking perspective, wrestlers from a takedown perspective). The result is that pure Tae Kwon Do cannot be used in an MMA fight-only tiny little bits of it every now and then. Almost all BJJ, on the other hand, can be used in an MMA fight (once the fight reaches the ground). That&rsquo;s why the best UFC fighters are almost always ranked as black belts in BJJ. In amateur MMA, a legitimate black belt in BJJ is almost always undefeated. Great boxers with good takedown defense also have awesome amateur records. So how do black belts in karate and Tae Kwon Do do in amateur MMA? Generally, not very well. In fact, most karate and Tae Kwon Do &#8220;dojos&#8221; are quite dismissive toward the very idea of real fighting. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, go to one of the many of these dojos in your city and ask them how many fighters they have. They&rsquo;ll tell you that they&rsquo;ve got none, but you&rsquo;ll probably see a lot of 12-year-olds running around with black belts on.</p>
<p>Finally, many people believe that BJJ is a newly developed system. In some ways it is, but in other ways, it&rsquo;s completely ancient. The Greeks used to have the Pankration, in which &#8220;tapping out&#8221; due to choke or joint lock or strikes from a dominant position on the ground was a real thing. In this sense, what we now call BJJ was in fact invented by the Greeks independent of outside influence. Hence, although &#8220;jiu-jitsu&#8221; is the Japanese name that we now use to describe submission grappling, the Japanese were not the originators of this grappling system.</p>
<p>Systems like Krav Maga are okay for self-defense, I suppose, but they do not allow for gentlemanly behavior in hand-to-hand, weaponless combat.</p>
<p>And just so you all know, I am a practicing amateur MMA fighter with quite a bit of experience. I put my money where my mouth is every day. Do you, or are you just going on what you&rsquo;ve heard?</p>

<p>as evidence that, &#8220;a big problem with the thoroughly Asian martial arts is that they are useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have read martial arts magazines for years. I have never in my life heard of Kiai as a martial art. </p>
<p>The mixed martial arts athlete who defeats this so called &#8220;Kiai master&#8221; is a Japanese with a black belt, probably in karate, which is a Japanese martial art. </p>
<p>This match does not demonstrate the superiority of the West to the Orient. It demonstrates how a fraud was exposed in Japan by a Japanese martial arts stylist.</p>

<p>I have fought in the cage for years, and I&rsquo;m telling you that you don&rsquo;t anything about fighting. As a real fighter, and not as a reader of martial arts magazines, I can tell that you&rsquo;re no different from the many &#8220;senseis&#8221; who run traditional Asian martial arts &#8220;dojos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also as a real fighter, I&rsquo;ve never heard of Tang Soo Do. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s useless, though. How many legitimate fights have you been in? And be honest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Vollmer only included the video which he included because it&rsquo;s a pretty popular one in the (real) fighting world. I had already seen it. There are, however, many other similar videos that Mr. Vollmer could have chosen. I suggest that you familiarize yourself with the Gracie Challenge. It would be a good supplement to your martial arts magazines, but it also may shatter your world. You should then learn the history of MMA and the UFC. You&rsquo;ll see that virtually all traditional Asian martial arts are not conducive to gentlemanly behavior in combat between two men who have agreed to fight.</p>
<p>Finally, answer me a question. You acknowledged earlier that MMA is the closest measure we really have of what really works in a real fight. How many of the best MMA fighters of all time rely on a traditional Asian martial art as the backbone of their game? Answer: None. And let&rsquo;s not forget that in the West, we have always had some form of fighting as a competitive sport, and the kind of fighting we generally like to compete in mirrors the times and the culture. We like what works and what&rsquo;s applicable, which was Mr. Vollmer&rsquo;s point.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-294079" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>John, your response, and perhaps even the responses of other posters, just shows your ignorance.</p>
<p>I am a legitimate purple belt in BJJ, which is an expert rank and takes years to reach. So let me inform you of the reason why BJJ is superior to wrestling. It&rsquo;s simple: BJJ is wrestling with many fewer rules. In wrestling, chokes and joint locks are basically illegal, while in BJJ, chokes and joint locks are legal. Also, Muay Thai may be superior to Western boxing, but if that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s for the same reason for which BJJ is superior to Western wrestling: Muay Thai is boxing with many fewer rules. The point is that Western boxing and wrestling are sports that, for various reasons, make certain things illegal that would not be off the table in a real fight. The thing you need to understand, however, is that the principles learned in Western boxing and wrestling are timeless fighting principles that can be used effectively against any unarmed opponent. A good wrestler or boxer is not easily defeated in a fight, and especially not when he&rsquo;s fighting an untrained opponent. This is NOT the case with a black belt in karate.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to go back and read my first independent post (the one that was not a response to yours). In it, I show just how un-Japanese BJJ is. Mr. Vollmer did a pretty good job of explaining this truth as well, but you&rsquo;re so entrenched in your martial arts magazines (and in your love for all things Asian) that you probably just ignored his argument completely.</p>

But this &#8220;will to believe,&#8221; whether in mystical martial arts or miraculous Hindu holy men was something we wanted to believe in. The barrenness of modern life was just too much.<br/>
This barrenness I attribute, quite  a bit, to Protestant doctrine. After it was established that you just had &#8220;to believe&#8221; to be saved, the way was open for the main event  &mdash;  money-making.  Money-making destroyed European culture as much as anything I can think of, and led to our cultural sterility and loss of values.<br/>
 Hence, our longing for the mystical and supernatural.<br/>
I believe that the mystical longings can be fulfilled in European paganism. Christianity has too many traps in it, even though it absorbed many pagan elements.</p>

<p>Jujitsu is all well and good. (I don&rsquo;t care how I misspelled it.) But Ninjitsu is even better than Jujitsu. Brazilians have actually not improved much on Jujitsu. </p>
<p>Karate is still a great option. Tae Kwon Do is a great option. Here&rsquo;s the difference that many MMA-tards don&rsquo;t comprehend - gang-fights don&rsquo;t allow you time to roll around seeking a submission hold. Weapons also preclude rolling around seeking a choke or joint lock.</p>
<p>Hand-to-hand combat is only a small part of combat. Mano-y-mano, hand-to-hand is an even smaller part of combat. Fighting with rules against fingering your enemy&rsquo;s eye-sockets is another limitation of MMA. That&rsquo;s because MMA is a contest, not really a fight per se.</p>
<p>More likely you fight with weapons. You don&rsquo;t hesitate to strike the eyes if you can. You may well encounter multiple attacker scenario. In these circumstances, Karate, Tae Kwon Do and Kung Fu are all more relevant than Jujitsu. </p>
<p>Ninjitsu is more important than any hand-to-hand combat technique. Ninjitsu is comprehensive guerrilla warfare from feudal Japan. Ninjitsu involves weapons and even espionage. </p>
<p>And even traditional Ninjitsu training is not up-to-date, as firearms are the most important modern weapon. Firearms training is the most important area for developing combat skill. </p>
<p>Finally, information above all is the most important, so you know your enemies plans and thwart them, ambush them, capture them before they&rsquo;ve even begun to resist. </p>
<p>And I conclude with this - Tae Kwon Do, Karate, Kung Fu are all more advanced than any system of hand-to-hand combat which does not have techniques for multiple attacker scenario. Sorry I had to refute one of your central assertions.</p>

<p>From the article: &#8220;Today, Asia has almost completely usurped our martial tradition, and  Asian martial arts come with an assumption that Asian culture &mdash; whatever that really is &mdash; is superior to Western culture. People who study judo or Tae Kwon Do or karate wear &ldquo;gis&rdquo; and talk about &ldquo;masters&rdquo; and &ldquo;dojos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allow me to get a little more in depth. Not only are the East Asian hand-to-hand combat systems better than what we have in West. Their swordsmen and archers also had better technique. </p>
<p>For example, the Japanese sword has a curve which matches the arc of your arm when you draw the sword, so that one motion draws the sword from the scabbard and slashes the enemy. That&rsquo;s better than a straight sword which drawing the weapon is one motion and attacking is the next motion. The Japanese sword has better metallurgy too. </p>
<p>From the article: &#8220;The Western view is different. We proudly used war and fighting to<br/>
make our boys into men, but we never pretended that a Kung-Fu-Panda-type<br/>
 master of some mysterious cult was the wisest man in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kung Fu Panda? How is that relevant? (I think the author is confusing the cultish aspects of Aikido, which is somewhat theoretical, unproven, without a long historical combat legacy.)</p>
<p>From the article: &#8220;And we have always admired strength for its own sake. We understand the reality of fighting; we realize that it is not a flashy, drawn-out set of &ldquo;moves&rdquo; that trick and defeat an enemy. Real combat is death in a few devastating blows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Real combat can be death in just the first blow. Japanese swordsmen were like gun-slingers of the Old West - one fast motion and the fight was over. The author&rsquo;s disdain for Eastern combat is just ignorance. Nothing could be more direct than instantaneous death. </p>
<p>From the article: &#8220;The most useful arts in hand-to-hand combat with no weapons are rarely very Asian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, the the best martial arts for hand-to-hand combat are always Asian without any exceptions. </p>
<p>From the article: &#8220;Boxing and wrestling are entirely Western, and of central importance in mixed martial arts (MMA).&#8221; </p>
<p>There are useful aspects of both wrestling and boxing. These compliment a fighter but they&rsquo;re not superior at all. These are sports with martial utility. </p>
<p>Boxing: As long as you play by the rules, boxing is effective&hellip; against boxing. But the moment they start kicking you or grappling you, then you have to go beyond boxing. The moment you fight two at once, you go beyond boxing. The moment you involve a weapon, you go beyond boxing. Karate is better for weapons or multiple attackers. </p>
<p>Wrestling: As long as you play by the rules of wrestling, wrestling is effective. </p>
<p>But if you go outside the rules to allow punching or kicking, or have more<br/>
than one enemy, suddenly you want Kung Fu, Tae Kwon Do, or Karate.  </p>
<p>(With multiple attackers without weapons, the three great fighting disciplines of East Asia are most effective. Also, these martial arts are complimentary to weapons skills.) </p>
<p>Now just watch some of the sports brawls and you see a Chinese basketball team has beaten the Brazilian basketball team, another Chinese basketball team beat up Georgetown Hoyas.</p>
<p>Jiu-jitsu, which is arguably the most important martial art in MMA, did start in Japan, but it took on a vastly different form when it got to Brazil.&#8221; </p>
<p>I think not. Looks quite similar, actually. Adding a few words to a vocabulary does not make a new language.</p>
<p>From the article: &#8220;Brazilians (and, increasingly, Americans) have since developed the art to such an extent that, in my opinion, it can hardly be called Asian. A thoroughly English name for jiu-jitsu would simply be &ldquo;submission grappling.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Jujitsu is what it is. If you do something else, call it something else but don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a new name for Jujitsu.</p>
<p>From the article: &#8220;Finally, a big problem with the thoroughly Asian martial arts is that<br/>
 they are useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swords were made obsolete by guns. Therefore, all swordplay is more-or-less useless, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic or European. Archery was also made obsolete by guns. Maybe you can say the European Knights were all stupid for ever having used swords. </p>
<p>From the article: &#8221; They are easily overcome in a fight, even by an untrained opponent. And yet, the business of teaching these &ldquo;arts&rdquo; is huge.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who teach crappy martial arts. We know this. Anyway, the article was drivel. I just wanted to refute it in more detail because it was so full of nonsense.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-298557" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Learning combat skills is largely an effort in sublimating pride to understand vulnerability as discipline.  It took me years to understand this because Tai Kwon Do and Judo were not giving me the skillsets I thought I needed to survive.   It wasn&rsquo;t until I watched Randori by Aikikai practitioners that it started to sink in that the reason why I wasn&rsquo;t getting where I needed to be was because real fighting isn&rsquo;t nearly that neat and clean.</p>
<p>The truth is, it is not until you realize how easy it is to be taken down, &#8216;on a bad day against a lesser man&rsquo; _or_ &#8216;your best day against a stronger multitude&rsquo; that you start to look for and accept the kinship of your own.  Because it is only then that you really understand how it all works: One man falls only when His Kindred refuse to stand to his defense.</p>
<p>This is the best thing that any form of _practical_ martial arts training, as body hardening, can do for us, by giving us the confidence to acknowledge and cover for each other&rsquo;s weaknesses.  The total fusion of togetherness is a synergy greater than it&rsquo;s sum.  And we owe that /effort/ to reach out to each other in desperate times to absolutely no one outside our race.</p>
<p>Past which, it&rsquo;s time to look at numbers.  We are an aging population and a population which has no defensive advantages as blacks do with their harder bodies and added testosterone as lessened inhibition against killing.  We are a slow breeding population who no longer undertakes the minimum wage heavy labor that gives Hispanics hordes of numbers as discipline of hardship.</p>
<p>If you fight one of these populations without a SIGNIFICANT leverage over these physical advantages (say 80:20,) as experience as much as fighting skills, you will lose.</p>
<p>And in losing, you will make it &#8216;okay&rsquo; to victimize those who look like you, because you dared to stand up and _by losing_ proved that &#8216;until proven otherwise&rsquo; all whites are equally vulnerable and (in their eyes) equally -deserving- of being made a victim.</p>
<p>Which is where it becomes time for the intelligent person to acquire &#8216;eveners&rsquo;.  A pistol is best, a rifle if you can afford to spend the money on both weapons marksmanship practice.  A tazer or real mace if you can afford them.</p>
<p>Because, when the end comes, it will be Millions vs. Millions.  And you will not have time to deal with them all, as equals.  And many will be armed themselves, unwilling to take &#8216;No, you may not!&rsquo; as a challenged answer.</p>
<p>Martial training is not about MMA or any other form of white (Boxing etc.) violent sport as an endorsement or rebellion against Asian cultural memes.</p>
<p>Learning The Way Of War is about recognizing your own limits and choosing to go with numbers and technology over the fair fight as close combat skills.  Anything else simply isn&rsquo;t practical.</p>

And it turns out your purple belt, in the BJJ grading system, is only an intermediate belt color, right after the blue belt!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey, Mr. Avenger!</p>
<p>You checked Wiki? How intelligent of you. Didn&rsquo;t your middle-school English teacher tell you not to cite them as a source? According to the rules of ALL grappling tournaments worldwide that I&rsquo;m aware of, if you&rsquo;re a purple belt and you&rsquo;re grappling no-gi, you must compete in the EXPERT/ADVANCED division, unless they allow you to compete exclusively against other purple belts no-gi. If you ask someone (not Wiki) who&rsquo;s aware of the culture of the sport, they&rsquo;ll tell you that purple belts are basically accepted by black belts as jiu-jitsu enthusiasts. The same is not said of blue belts or white belts. You&rsquo;re an idiot.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least he wasn&rsquo;t lying about his qualifications or skill level.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t lie, you moron. I told you I was a purple belt. I just explained that in jiu-jitsu culture, notwithstanding what you read on Wikipedia, purple belts are considered experts (see the North American Grappling Association-that&rsquo;s a better source than Wikipedia).</p>
<p>&#8220;You said your skill in BJJ is oh! so superior and you believe Chinese arts are totally useless in a fight? I studied Kenpo and Wing Chung and, man, I am just quaking in fear&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to fight you (in a totally legal, organized way). And if there&rsquo;s a way for us to do this without me giving away my identity on the Internet, I say we try to set it up. But before you agree, I will only use my jiu-jitsu skill to control you on the ground. Once you can&rsquo;t get up or fight back, I will unleash violence on you such that you haven&rsquo;t seen. When the ref pulls me off your unconscious body, they will take you straight to the hospital for reconstructive surgery. Then will you know to keep your mouth shut when you&rsquo;re in the presence of El_Baga_Doucha_Libtard.</p>
