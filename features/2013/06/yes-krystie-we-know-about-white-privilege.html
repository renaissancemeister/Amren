<div class="intro-paragraph">
And Abigail Fisher probably does, too.</div> 
</div> 


<p><em>On Tuesday, someone named Krystie Yandoli wrote a condescending <a href="http://jezebel.com/an-open-letter-to-affirmative-action-reject-abigail-fis-570774253">open letter</a> to Abigail Fisher, the plaintiff in the recent Supreme Court <a href="../../../features/2013/06/what-the-supreme-court-just-did.html">racial preferences case</a>. From her soapbox at Jezebel.com, Miss Yandoli treats Miss Fisher like a cry baby and lectures her on &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; and the &ldquo;intricacies of systemic racism.&rdquo; Gregory Hood replies in his own open letter:</em></p>
<p>Dear Krystie,</p>
<p>As someone who actually did get into all the colleges he applied to, I have to take issue with your <a href="http://jezebel.com/an-open-letter-to-affirmative-action-reject-abigail-fis-570774253">letter</a> to Abigail Fisher, the plaintiff in <em>Fisher v. University of Texas</em>.</p>
<p>You seem to think that Miss (oh, this is Jezebel, <i>Ms.) </i>Fisher should simply move on from being rejected by the University because, as you explain to her, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this thing called white privilege. You have it. I have it. Our parents have it. And it lessens the likelihood that we&rsquo;ll experience any kind of deeply rooted inequalities and discrimination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, the heart of Fisher&rsquo;s case is that she actually did experience discrimination &mdash; not an unfalsifiable mystery discrimination found in an &ldquo;invisible knapsack&rdquo; but real, explicit discrimination on the basis of her race, as codified in laws and regulations.</p>
<p>When our society made the decision to abolish legal restrictions on non-whites, the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/john-derbyshire-on-fathers-daughters-and-uncle-reality-what-the-next-generation-doesn-t-kno">expectation</a> was that it would lead to equal performance among racial groups. We were told, after all, that racial differences are only skin deep.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, that equality hasn&rsquo;t materialized. The racial breakdown of crime, income, education, and other social indicators is pretty much what &ldquo;racists&rdquo; always said it would be. We were also right about what the public schools would look like after integration &mdash; and what the cities would look like after the end of restrictive covenants.</p>
<p>So the powers that be moved the goalposts and came up with something called white privilege.</p>
<p>Krystie (Krystie with a K and a Y? Adorable.), I went to college too, so trust me, we don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;google&rdquo; white privilege. From the moment we stepped on campus and went to our first mandatory &ldquo;diversity seminar,&rdquo; we learned all about it. In fact, at colleges like the <a href="http://thefire.org/case/752.html">University of Delaware</a>, white students were required to admit they were &ldquo;racist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, yes, we learned about white privilege. In fact, we didn&rsquo;t really learn about anything else.</p>
<div id="attachment_104670" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HowItWorks.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104670" alt="Understand how it works now?" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HowItWorks.jpg" width="240" height="228"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Understand how it works now?</p></div>
<p>In the comments section of your letter, there are the usual attacks on Miss Fisher for not being smart enough to get into the University of Texas. As I&rsquo;ve never known anyone more status conscious than egalitarians, I&rsquo;m going to have to pull rank for a second and confess I attended a university considerably more prestigious than Syracuse University.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t feel bad &mdash; my college was a joke. Classes consisted of discussions of what Jon Stewart had said the night before, professors complaining about Republicans, and in one African history class, building a slave ship out of cardboard to learn about the Middle Passage. In the words of Joseph Sobran (google him), &ldquo;In 100 years we have gone from teaching Latin and Greek in high school to teaching Remedial English in college.&#8221;</p>
<p>And even in this infantile playground, we couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the &ldquo;affirmative action people&rdquo; couldn&rsquo;t, shall we say, keep up. Around the country, they get <a href="http://www.bet.com/news/national/2011/09/01/what-s-keeping-black-college-students-from-making-the-grade-.html">poorer grades</a>, have higher dropout rates, and more discipline problems. This is despite <a href="http://dogstreetjournal.com/story/824">special programs to hold their hand</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_studies">phony subjects</a> to buttress their self esteem.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s be honest Krystie, students <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/03/14/more-college-admissions-secrets.html">lie about their ethnicity</a> in order to improve their chances of getting a job or college admissions. Some students even <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/04/19/researchers-colleges-should-count-gays-but-fake-homosexuals-remain-significant-problem/">pretend to be homosexual</a>, because that will help. Has there ever been another case of discrimination in history in which people actively try to join the &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo; class?</p>
<p>By contrast, students who come from organizations that aren&rsquo;t exactly popular with the ruling class &mdash; such as 4-H or high school ROTC &mdash; actually face penalties when applying to college.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s really going on here?</p>
<p>Well, Krystie, we on the Dissident Right recognize that even under a democracy, there are rulers and there are the ruled. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burnham">James Burnham</a>, a former Trotskyite (google him), developed a theory of the &ldquo;managerial elite&rdquo; that took power after the collapse of laissez-faire capitalism. The elite today derives its power from controlling social behavior &mdash; breaking down the traditional institutions that stand in its way.</p>
<p>And, well, you&rsquo;re a part of that process and part of that elite. I realize you might not think it when you look at your &ldquo;journalist&rdquo; salary and student-loan debt, but you&rsquo;re an important foot solider in advancing the ideology that governs the West. I&rsquo;ll try to explain, and I&rsquo;ll use small words.</p>
<p>Why is white privilege a lie? It&rsquo;s because a white person &mdash; every white person &mdash; has access to wealth and career prospects only insofar as he remains actively anti-white or at least silent about race. Regardless of a person&rsquo;s accomplishments, achievements, background, intelligence, or wealth, a single comment &mdash; even a truthful one &mdash; can destroy him overnight. A white person is allowed to be successful &mdash; or even allowed to <i>exist </i>without persecution &mdash; only insofar as he denounces his racial identity.</p>
<p>Where to begin? &ldquo;Gender studies&rdquo; majors and other ignoramuses lectured us on biology when the legendary scientist James Watson stated an unpopular (but true) opinion about the long-term fate of Africa. And let&rsquo;s look at the policy world, where those &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; conservatives caved in almost instantly and fired <a href="/news/2013/05/craven-conservatives.html">Jason Richwine</a> (and <a href="../../../opinion/2012/04/the-rationality-of-firing-john-derbyshire.html">John Derbyshire</a>, and <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-leftward-course-of-human-events">Kevin Lamb</a>, and <a href="../../../opinion/2012/01/conservative-ritual-sacrifice.html">Leif Parsell</a>) for saying obviously true things. Or how about Paula Deen, a loyal Obama supporting scalawag who is now being destroyed for giving vent to a racial slur 30 years ago, after she had a gun in her face?</p>
<div id="attachment_104671" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/JamesWatson.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104671" alt="James Watson: Tell the truth, lose your job." src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/JamesWatson.jpg" width="500" height="556"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">James Watson: Tell the truth, lose your job.</p></div>
<p>These denunciations of white awareness have become ritualized performances, with predictable language like &ldquo;loathsome&rdquo; and &ldquo;noxious&rdquo; and of course, hate, hate, hate! It&rsquo;s all very tiresome.</p>
<p>Yes, whites tend to do better economically than blacks and Hispanics. Mostly it is because as a group, they are <a href="/"> smarter</a>. This biological <a href="../../../features/2012/01/the-reality-of-race.html">reality</a> exists regardless of what you think about it, and racial disparities in society are the consequences of that reality. However, I recognize you literally can&rsquo;t even conceive of that as an explanation and if you could &mdash; and wrote about it &mdash; all your &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t save your career.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s set aside biological reality for a moment. Let&rsquo;s concede that whites get some benefit from the actions of their ancestors and from the social systems they set up.</p>
<p>But which whites? The descendents of WASPs? Some of them, yes. We&rsquo;ve all read <i><a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2012/12/how-the-irish-became-white-part-1/">How the Irish Became White</a></i>, but the fact remains that non-founding stock white populations faced obstacles when they came here, many as refugees or penniless. Perhaps the archetypal American story is a family slowly lifting itself up through the generations. We&rsquo;re all familiar with people who are the &ldquo;first in their family to go to college.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_104669" style="width: 354px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Horatio.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104669" alt="Works only if you're white." src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Horatio.jpg" width="344" height="540"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Works only if you&rsquo;re white.</p></div>
<p>To say their accomplishments are because of &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; is not just to say that they didn&rsquo;t earn it. It&rsquo;s to say that it is somehow illegitimate for families as a group to improve their station. It&rsquo;s to say that all advantages from birth or station are wrong, and that government&rsquo;s job is to eliminate them. This is a recipe for unlimited government. Is this what you want?</p>
<p>Moreover, affirmative action doesn&rsquo;t punish only whites. Asian families are outperforming whites despite the fact that they have no &ldquo;white privilege.&rdquo; They are even outperforming whites on the &ldquo;culturally biased&rdquo; standardized tests. Should they be punished too? And what does that tell you about &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo;?</p>
<p>But if is only whites who are uniquely privileged and evil, what about poor whites? In recent decades, many Americans are doing worse, and my generation takes for granted that we will not do as well as our parents. Most poor people in this country (by absolute numbers, not per capita) are whites. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why &ldquo;white trash,&rdquo; i.e. white workers, can be publicly insulted and dehumanized without consequence. Even &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4f9zR5yzY">white privilege&rdquo; believer</a> Louis CK <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlNyN8qNvgc">is with me on this one</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_104672" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/PoorWhite.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104672" alt="Living the dream of white privilege." src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/PoorWhite.jpg" width="550" height="319"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Living the dream of white privilege.</p></div>
<p>If you really believe that whites are collectively guilty as a people, why can&rsquo;t you just say so? But then don&rsquo;t give me any nonsense about equality. And don&rsquo;t ask the rest of us to share your perverted morality. As I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen on the Internet &mdash; anti-racism is just another word for anti-white.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s another big problem with the idea of &ldquo;white privilege.&rdquo; If &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; says America was set up by and for whites, why can&rsquo;t whites openly advance their interests in &ldquo;their&rdquo; country? Why are WASPs &mdash; the onetime &ldquo;elite&rdquo; &mdash; all but invisible as a group today?</p>
<p>Only white nations are told they have a moral responsibility to allow mass foreign immigration &mdash; even countries with no history of non-white immigration, such as Switzerland or Germany. No non-white countries are stupid enough to think they have a similar obligation &mdash; their leaders know mass foreign immigration has, in the long term, identical consequences to military conquest. The Tibetans with whom you have at least some <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/krystie-yandoli/dalai-lama-love-_b_1970848.html">familiarity</a> are being dispossessed by a Chinese state-sponsored program of genocide &mdash; through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinicization_of_Tibet">mass Han Chinese immigration</a> &mdash; and they are doing their best to fight back.</p>
<p>So if we are so privileged, why can&rsquo;t we have our own country? Just pack us all off into a corner of the country. What&rsquo;s the downside? Everyone else will be free from our oppression, patriarchy, and heteronormativity. There will be no non-whites we can exploit or discriminate against. After all, whatever white people say, they keep trying to move away to white communities &mdash; and non-whites keep following them, presumably because they have some kind of inner compulsion to be oppressed.</p>
<p>A country for whites isn&rsquo;t that radical an idea. Your friends over at Gawker don&rsquo;t have a problem with the idea that <a href="http://gawker.com/the-yids-are-alright-10-days-of-spiritual-decadence-on-496161275">Jews get to have their own country</a>.</p>
<p>But we know that won&rsquo;t happen here. America isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;white&rdquo; country – <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2012/11/a-white-nationalist-memo-to-white-male-republicans/">it&rsquo;s not even a country</a>, really, just a market. And who benefits from that? Look at the amnesty issue: The National Council of La Raza and &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; squawk about it, but it&rsquo;s corporate America that really pushes it.</p>
<p>Just like on a college campus, the multicultural mascots are pampered pets of the administration, or in a larger sense, they are the clients of the government and are the ideal consumers and workers. It&rsquo;s about cheap labor, driving down wages, and trampling any institution that gets in the way between consumer and exploiter, be that family, nation, or union. And the results are all around you, in the decline of living standards, the collapse of public infrastructure, the end of social trust, and the dispossession of American workers.</p>
<p>Lefties like to pretend that capitalism is responsible for perpetuating ethnic divisions to hold down the working class, but it&rsquo;s the other way around. Multiculturalism is the ultimate path to making sure our rulers don&rsquo;t have a national community &mdash; and don&rsquo;t have to worry about social solidarity, class justice, or traditional institutions that could get in the way of making a quick buck. <a href="http://www.newrightausnz.com/2005/11/28/big-business-as-a-supporter-of-anti-racism-noam-chomsky/">Even Noam Chomsky said as much</a>.</p>
<p>Come on, Krystie &mdash; you majored in ethnic and gender studies. Why does that major exist? Because there&rsquo;s an industry behind it, funded by the powerful. Why is it funded by the powerful? Because it breaks down the institutions &mdash; especially the family &mdash; that stand in the way of greater social control for the managerial elite. You&rsquo;re as much a part of the system as Dick Cheney or Goldman Sachs &mdash; just much farther down on the totem poll. &ldquo;White privilege&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t some ideological weapon against the system &mdash; it&rsquo;s one of its slogans.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WhiteSkin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-104673" alt="WhiteSkin" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WhiteSkin.jpg" width="550" height="379"/></a></p>
<p>If you really want to fight the &ldquo;One Percent,&rdquo; take a look at the Dissident Right&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2011/10/radicals-for-the-system/">critique of the financial elite</a>. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re just another <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2010/12/explicit-whiteness-christian-landers-stuff-white-people-like/">SWPL</a> pretending to suffer from white guilt as a way to prove your social status while gleefully participating in the system.</p>
<p>Look, I feel for you. You&rsquo;ve been brought up in a country that deliberately left you uneducated. Your whole life you&rsquo;ve wanted to be a good person and so you defend happy words like &ldquo;equality&rdquo; and &ldquo;freedom.&rdquo; But they are lies &mdash; marketing slogans. I don&rsquo;t blame you for your contempt of conservatives. The <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/memo-to-david-frum-the-gop-is-extreme-because-you-helped-purge-its-extremists">Beltway Right</a> are just low paid corporate lobbyists.</p>
<p>But, Krystie, when all is said and done, so are you.</p>
<p>I hope you become something other than another hipster leftie. After all, the worst part of the <a href="http://youtu.be/XkXM6dTRzDc?t=46s">last men</a> (and women, got to be gender inclusive) is not that they are wrong &mdash; it&rsquo;s that they are <i>boring.</i></p>
<p>Love,</p>

Is there any counter-brainwashing movement out there to nip this problem in the bud? Our survival may depend on it.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-298610" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I take the attitude that if you show your people your true nature you cannot be called a coward whereas &#8216;polite conversation&rsquo; (and hurried retreat) from racism as a defense of your genetics against outside attack can only make it look like you are a frustrated white who is angry at a perception of already lost privilege as fear of losing what is left.<br/>
Nobody likes pathetic drips.<br/>
In this, it is best not to focus on heroes as your nephew has likely &#8216;already made up his mind&rsquo; on Mandella and will only change it if he sees that the black run society that man demanded as replacement for the white one already in place, has in fact been the worst possible thing that could have ever happened in ZA.<br/>
As indeed, blacks on their own have made ZA one of the most hellish of modern societies on the planet.<br/>
They are now number one on the rape list and number seven on the murder list. All of their infrastructure is failing because blacks won&rsquo;t work for blacks when the black run government drowns in constant charges of corruption and influence peddling if not outright murder.<br/>
No argument about how whites created the problem applies because Apartheid ended in 1994 when most of the blacks now causing problems were not even born. Indeed, while black townships were always high crime because they were never actively intervened in by whites (contrary to popular belief), Apartheid white society had almost no crime.</p>
<p>Whites in ZA now exist as Greek Slaves once did in Rome: valued only as backroom problem solvers while the &#8216;Large and In Charge&rsquo; blacks out front pretend to run things. This means that they have no way up in life as entry to managerial classes but will forever be underpaid to do what blacks with an average 84 IQ _among college students_ are not able to.<br/>
Unlike the military where incompetence is promoted into isolation, this reality will destroy South African whites social contract justification for upholding or improving a black run state.<br/>
As if even level of insult is not enough, the technically brilliant and beautiful Boers are hunted by death squads with random acts of serial murder, torture and &#8216;kill the Boer&rsquo; irrational hysteria being used to justify the theft of large scale farms and industry that once made white South Africa second only to Rhodesia as the bread basket of the southern third of the country.<br/>
To the extent that they can white flight has resulted in renewal of separate communities albeit in only a fraction of their former territories, locked like animals inside laagered enclaves of barbed wire topped walls and walking security patrols around apartment complexes.</p>
<p>With the increasing use of Indians as replacement technical specialists, it is only a matter of time before the raging rivalries between Xhosa and Zulu gangs are &#8216;resolved&rsquo; the only way Africans know how. And then Whites will be next on the list to be butchered to the last as they never were at Blauwkrans.<br/>
If you won&rsquo;t do it yourself, tell your nephew this as a joke. From some horrible white racist who dared to say something that was utterly contrary to your expectations of what ZA was like.<br/>
Dare him to prove me wrong.<br/>
_IF_ he is as smart as you say he is, his research for counters to my points will cause something to begin to tick away in him as a clock that cannot be stopped. And his love of other races more than his own will begin to be challenged as a simple (white) insistence for the answer to the question: &#8220;Why?&#8221;<br/>
If they are this violent and aggressive and backward, why does he admire them or enjoy their company?<br/>
Is there something wrong with him? Or is it simply that he has been very badly misled and needs only step into the truth?<br/>
Small steps begun late may never lead anywhere. But bold assertions which challenge a young person to question the assumptions of their teachers often leads to incredibly powerful conversions.</p>

People stick to what they learn from their mothers (female) and teachers (mostly female) and fathers (male, but currently often absent). Most far righters are male, and so their writings tend to appeal more to males. And they say much more about women&rsquo;s failings than about what women could be and should be aiming for. Maybe that would make men think, &#8220;Wow, we need to do better&#8221;, but my first reaction is &#8220;Ouch!&#8221; and I suspect many women don&rsquo;t make it any further.</p>

We need to work on deprogramming feminists-lite. If we have sites that present an attractive alternative to feminism - what it really means to be female - at least some women might turn from it. Women, in my experience, and in the observations of many more knowledgeable, tend to react more emotionally than men. Constant degradation of our current state, however accurate, will not draw women in on a large scale, but those that express admiration for our *natural* state might.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-302114" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Obama is just about as much of a war monger as George W. Bush. He got his Nobel Peace Prize for being America&rsquo;s first mulatto president. Hillary Clinton is also a war monger, eager to jump into a war with Iran. If the Democrats really cared about working and middle class blacks and whites they would not have passed a bill giving 11 million illegal immigrants citizenship and creating 30 million green cards over the next 10 years, vastly increasing the labor force and so increasing unemployment and reducing wages. Who, aside from the ethnic activists like La Raza supported the bill? Billionaires wanting cheap labor   &mdash;   heads of Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, and agribusiness, meat packing, and construction business moguls. This vast increase in our population is also not good for our environment, so the Democrats prove to be no better for the environment than the Republicans. Democrats have also stuck a knife into the backs of the white working class every chance they had   &mdash;   with forced busing, section 8 housing, affirmative action, and gun grabbing. This is what created the &#8220;Reagan Democrats&#8221; although in reality the white working class has no place to go. Anybody who thinks Democrats are the pro-peace, pro-labor, pro-environment party is about 40 years behind the times. We now have one party, with two make believe divisions purely for show, owned by individuals each of whom has more money than every Amren reader put together.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about people who get majors in ethnic and gender studies. They are worse than useless on the job market.

Invariably they usually give some flowering libtarded response rubbing upon anti-white sentiments. Then I would usually follow up with, &#8221; It sounds like you have an inherent bias against white people and their pursuits..&#8221; Oh and then they scramble and backpedal.<br/>

<p>This is very true. I love seeing them being incapable of following their beliefs to their logical conclusion.</p>
<p>Such as: if whites are so horribly oppressive, and if whites oppress non-whites without even realizing it, then wouldn&rsquo;t the best course of action be to completely separate whites from non-whites? Then non-whites wouldn&rsquo;t have to be oppressed!</p>
<p>Whenever you say something along those lines to one of them they start calling you a segregationist and raving about Jim Crow, completely refusing to actually think about the very simple line of reasoning behind the idea, <i>which stems from their own ideas about the oppressiveness of whites!</i></p>

It may have to do with the fact that their written languages are made up of thousands of symbols that they are required to learn. Still Asians are very boring. When last did you hear a really nice song from East Asia or see a big exciting movie or read an exciting novel coming from East Asia? If they are intelligent, it appears to be of a one-dimensional kind.</p>

What is more boring that a middle aged black man with a legitimately earned MBA working somewhere in the corporate hierarchy and waiting for the day he can start collecting his golden pension and cashing out his 401K? Mostly, successful middle class and upper middle class people in professional, management and technical occupations are exceedingly boring. Get with it, poor whites and Asians have a lot of vibrancy too. They use drugs and end up in prison at high rate. They have high rates of alcoholism and domestic violence against spouses, cohabitants and children. Possibly, the women have high rates of having the wrong guy&rsquo;s child. One thing I am not sure of is if East Asian have a high rate of out-of-wedlock births. That much I doubt. But white girls in their late teens just love to have out-of-wedlock babies. Doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter if the father is black, Hispanic or white. Just as long as he a lot vibrancy! Vibrancy (in the male) is a &#8220;catch all&#8221; for mentally unstable with violent tendencies and a &#8220;take matters into your own hands&#8221; mentality, combined with an affection for one or more idioms of interesting vernacular (popular) music.</p>
<p>Did I nail it, or what?</p>

<p>The oath that the Athenians took before the battle of Plataiai in 479 B.C.E (&hellip;) is inscribed as follows: &#8220;If I remain faithful to the inscribed oath, may women give birth to children who resemble their parents. If I do not, may they give birth to monsters&#8221; (Daily life of the ancient Greeks p.212, Robert Garland)</p>
<p>I think that oath still apply to us today in our fight for our freedom but unfortunately theres more at stake than our childrens appearance and the Greeks knew it.</p>

I refuse to be ashamed of our heritage and urge everyone who feels likewise to say it out loud, in mixed company, whenever and however you please.</p>
<p>White people have gifted the planet with technologies that elevate the human standard of living to heights unimaginable even to the richest kings of other contemporary cultures. We generously share these technologies with others, despite their ingratitude and inability to maintain them without our sweat and treasure.

Most feminist websites talk about this sometimes; it&rsquo;s the new trendy thing among them. Basically it&rsquo;s the idea that all the different &#8220;oppressions&#8221; are interrelated, and so if you want to be a &#8220;good feminist,&#8221; you must also be anti-racist, pro-homosexuality, anti-religious (unless it&rsquo;s the religion of &#8216;people of color,&rsquo; like Islam, in which case you must respect it and think it&rsquo;s wonderful), etc.</p>
<p>Any white feminist who just wants to &#8216;fight the patriarchy&rsquo; and not be an anti-racist crusader will eventually get lectured and browbeaten by her fellow feminists until she converts to their way of thinking and begins hating her race.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-299186" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The concept of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is bogus, contrived nonsense in its very inception and design. It has no objective existence that can&rsquo;t be explained in other ways.</p>
<p>For example, just the words &#8220;white privilege&#8221; are politically-motivated hyperbole. </p>
<p>The phenomena the words are supposed to describe could just as easily, and more accurately, use the words &#8220;majority privilege,&#8221; that is, the same phenomena that &#8220;white privilege&#8221; are supposed to describe exist in many if not all countries where there are significant majority-minority dynamics within a country&rsquo;s population. There&rsquo;s nothing special about how white majorities express their &#8220;privilege&#8221; other than that there is a class of whites within white countries which are so hostile to fellow whites that they feel they must design this term in the harshest sense possible. Apparently it&rsquo;s more important to browbeat and guilt trip whites than it is to come up with a sober, more objective term to account for phenomena that have existed in all societies, throughout history.</p>
<p>Next, it&rsquo;s important to realize that this term really took off in 60s and 70s left wing academia. Whatever phenomena leftists were describing back then have changed dramatically since then. It&rsquo;s been 50 years after all. </p>
<p>Thus, when someone throws around the term vaguely, it&rsquo;s worthwhile (for the benefit of bystanders at least) to challenge what exactly they mean. The verifiable examples of real discrimination that non-whites suffer has gone down dramatically, and the benefits that whites get by virtue of skin color alone are very few indeed. And the examples of discrimination that whites face that they didn&rsquo;t 50 years ago are increasing rapidly. Arguing any of these points will put &#8220;white privilege&#8221; believers on the run - the facts just don&rsquo;t support much, if any, real existence of their cherished article of faith.</p>
<p>Last, I would just add that the concept of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is a pernicious bit of left wing anti-white propaganda that we should really tackle, tear down, and destroy with whatever effort we can muster. It&rsquo;s a poisonous and toxic term that our white children are getting exposed to from day one in our public schools. It&rsquo;s got to go. A big thank you to Gregory Hood for tackling this abominable bit of anti-white dogma.</p>

I believe that a truly horrific economic implosion is coming. Possibly by 2014, certainly by 2016. Which leads me to ask you (if you agree about the implosion) how you think the imprinted youth will react? I&rsquo;m not at all sure they will side with the state or the institutions they see as their protectors. That&rsquo;s where you would think the brainwashing would lead them. I&rsquo;m not certain that will happen. I can&rsquo;t really make a rational argument for my doubts. It&rsquo;s just that the internal contradictions of the regime will become so glaring and the immiseration of the brainwashed will be so intense that I think there is a possibility that the smog will finally break for them.</p>

<p>I live in what&rsquo;s basically a small village in NE Ohio. The number of blacks I&rsquo;ve seen around here I can count on one hand. I feel okay with walking around this town. But as a Detroit native, I still lock my doors, because it only takes one person and a window of opportunity.</p>

It is true that &#8220;normal&#8221; whites inherit a sense of racial self-identity just like &#8220;normal&#8221; members of the Han population inside and outside the Middle Kingdom. The installation of white self-hatred and racial guilt in our younger generation is largely the result of cultural marxist indoctrination and one-sided modern movies, aided and abetted of course by oriental leftist immigrants.</p>

China has been flexing its muscles again in northern India and in contested island areas.</p>
<p>The world wide white settlement from 1500-1950 occurred partly because of western superiority in maritime technology and application. Chinese imperial expansion had occurred &#8220;inland&#8221; - in the 7th century T&rsquo;ang rule reached Annam, Korea and west of theTarim Basin. &#8220;The two thousand year history of Vietnam is largely a history of fierce resistance to Chinese aggression&hellip;a thousand years of hated Chinese rule&#8221; (Jeffrey Record). China and Japan were at war 1894-5 over Korea.</p>
<p>As for Japanese staying where they are, this was not the case between 1937 and 1945. I shall not try to count the number of countries they invaded. There were many faults in British imperial policy but many in the populations of most Commnwealth ex-colonies have better memories of our government and legacy than is the case of those who survived the Japanese Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>

Until then, it sounds like a politically correct lie to me. We women have our place alongside our men, but we are alongside them. We are not the same. We are not equals, but designed to complement each other perfectly.</p>
<p>As for college, what I gained from that was the knowledge that college is, for most people who attend it nowadays, a complete and utter waste of time. I am self-taught and yes, White men did give me access to that education, by inventing the English language, the scientific method, higher mathematics, the printing press, electricity, computers, the internet, the refractive lenses that correct my vision enough to enable me to read, the agricultural techniques that enable me to eat virtually any food I want in abundance whether it&rsquo;s in season or not, the medical techniques and tools that have saved my life once or twice, the antibiotics that destroyed childhood infections that would have killed me even 100 years ago, etc.</p>
<p>What White men have given to the rest of this ungrateful world simply cannot be overstated. The vast majority of us exist because of White male largesse. It is time we recognized that fact once and for all. Without White men, there is no White Western civilization.</p>

<p>Stop with the &#8220;White privilege&#8221; nonsense because nobody here buys it, ok? Whites are the ONLY ones who go around feeling guilty for a past they had nothing to do with. Whites in past history didn&rsquo;t do anything non-Whites didn&rsquo;t do. Non-Whites, all over the globe since the beginning of time, invaded, slaughtered, stole, raped and savaged. Sadly, that is HUMAN history. </p>
<p>&#8220;As Vladimir Putin said in an interview a couple of weeks ago, white Americans committed an unprecedented act of ethnic cleansing in all of human history, wiping out the Native Americans. He also rightly said that dropping an A-bomb on already defeated Japan is something that separates Americans from Russians. Even Joseph Stalin, whom he admitted was a dictator, would not have been so ruthless as to do the same to Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>I burst out laughing when I read this nonsense. While some American Indians were killed, it was hardly unprecedented. They were not &#8220;wiped out&#8221;, the ones that did die, mostly died from contagious diseases and most intermarried with Whites(see diversity kills groups).</p>
<p> Putin is a massive hypocrite and in no position to point fingers at America. Far more people died under communism in Russia than American Indians were killed. As far as dropping the A-bomb, Japan and the US were still at war. It was a choice between millions of American soldiers getting killed or Japanese, so we rightly dropped the A-bomb, Japan and Russia would have done the same thing. Stalin was utterly ruthless towards a defeated Germany and murdered millions of his own people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet Americans just shrug these atrocities off and get on and enjoy life.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, Americans and Whites are the only ones who try to atone for the past, non-Whites don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something unique about the Anglo Saxon mindset&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes there is. Anglo-Saxons are the only ones today who put other races ahead of their own.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-301427" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Readers should indeed refer to the work of Dr Rudolf Rummel on democide, though I personally feel that some of his statistics err on the high side because of his commitment to &#8220;liberal democratic&#8221; government.<br/>
For the Soviet Union alone he estimates over 61 million deaths.<br/>
For the PRC 1949-87, 35 million was his original figure, but he has added to it with man-made famine estimates (cf. Frank Dikotter, &c)<br/>
In the war between West and East Pakistan, he suggests 1.5 milion.<br/>
In Beijing-supported Cambodia, 2.4 million.<br/>
So Rummel is a nonsense-blatherer over life-saving &#8220;communism&#8221; but right about western imperialists. Consider the comment of Steven Rosefield in &#8220;Red Holocaust&#8221; on this quoted in the Wikipedia article on communist mass murder.</p>

We can&rsquo;t all be right about everything. Being wrong on one thing does not mean you can be right about another thing.</p>
<p>You mention Dikotter&rsquo;s book  &mdash;  it is laughable   &mdash;  -he arrives at some massive death toll by comparing to a &#8216;normal&rsquo; mortality of 1% (yes its there right inside his book).</p>
<p>Problem? Well 1% was the normal mortality of the US and Britain at the time. For a typical developing nation of 1960 it was around 2 to 2.7%. Based on Dikotter&rsquo;s numbers there was then no excess deaths from the famine, relative to a typical developing country (because China&rsquo;s mortality during the GLF was around 2.45 %).</p>
<p>Just lies after lies, easily debunked. </p>
<p>I remember reading something of Rummel&rsquo;s once where he claimed the nutritional intake of Chinese had gone down under communism. He came up with some supposed daily calorie intake before 1949, or pre-revolutionary China   &mdash;  -the figure provided was higher than that of the average American today! I&rsquo;ll dig it up sometime if you are interested.</p>
<p>However give credit where credit is due. Rummel is right about Western imperialism</p>

<p>DIkotter claims to have trawled PRC documents. He comes up with a total number of deaths, or death rate. That is what he gets from the documents.</p>
<p>He then claims 1% would have been the &#8216;normal&rsquo; mortality had the GLF not happened.</p>
<p>The actual death rate - 1% x base population gives you the so called ;&rsquo;excess&rsquo; deaths. He multiplies this figure by 4.</p>
<p>Now you go away and do some homework and tell me that 1% was a &#8216;normal&rsquo; mortality for a developing country in the 1950s.</p>

Both sides committed war crimes in World War II. As usual the victors wrote the history books. But as for Stalin and his predecessor Lenin, their worst war crimes were committed against their own people. Millions of people in Russia and Ukraine were deliberately starved to death, worked to death as slave labor, or simply shot. And it isn&rsquo;t just white people   &mdash;   Mao caused the death by murder or starvation of 18 - 30 million Chinese in his &#8220;Great Leap Forward&#8221;, In Cambodia the Khmer Rouge murdered between one and three million people, in a population of eight million. Communists murdered more people in the middle 70 years of the 20th century than white Anglo Saxons did in three centuries.</p>

She contradicts herself on the mental criticism, as she elsewhere points out that Miss Fisher has a very exceptional 3.59 GPA.</p>
<p>The journalistic hack decides to admit that she too was rejected from her dream college (but she&rsquo;s such a good sport that she doesn&rsquo;t bitch about it like Miss Fisher) but she neither a) states which college she was rejected by nor b) indicates whether it was, like in the case of Miss Fisher, due to racial preferences. The fact that she doesn&rsquo;t state AA as the reason for her rejection makes it clear that she got rejected simply because she wasn&rsquo;t up to snuff, ie. not at all the same as the injustice Miss Fisher had to endure.</p>
<p>Yandoli intuits a look of smugness in the photo of Miss Fisher, and even goes into her crystal ball and assumes this is inherited from her mother.</p>
<p>Finally, she fawns over the black camera worker, and even hopes the latter is not taking orders from her reporter boss, cause, you know, that would be slavery.</p>
<p>Now I will proceed to gouge out my eyes for having visited that vile site.</p>

In the mid-80s, there was a movie called &#8220;Fuzz&#8221; with a scene about setting somebody on fire. In some NE city, blackamoors set a white woman on fire, copying the movie. The woman&rsquo;s white husband (a social worker) was interviewed, begging everybody to take it easy, as the &#8216;youths&rsquo; were from an oppressed minority, and not really responsible. I guess it&rsquo;s something that the lady didn&rsquo;t have to live to see her husband sink so low, but he&rsquo;s a good example of invincible ignorance. I look at societal recovery as the Eskimo scrimshaw artist described sculpture   &mdash;   to carve a walrus, you take a piece of ivory and cut away everything that isn&rsquo;t a walrus.</p>

<p>He was right to say no to Vietnam and it&rsquo;s too bad more Americans didn&rsquo;t. I give them credit for wanting to be courageous and do their duty, but they gave life and limb for traitorous scum.</p>
<p>And Ali&rsquo;s stance against race mixing was certainly not publicized. Had it been, the ordinary White American would have had a much different opinion of Ali.</p>
<p>Blacks often go off the script. Always be ready for that. THey are a &#8220;loose cannon&#8221; for the liberals. Remember that the people controlling the blacks are the real enemies. Sometimes you can take advantage of the fact that the blacks have wills that can be independent of their would-be controllers, especially when those controllers cannot offer them immediate benefits.</p>
