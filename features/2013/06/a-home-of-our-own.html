The new direction for white activism.</div>

<p align="center"><b>Arthur Kemp, <i>Nova Europa: European Survival Strategy in a Darkening World</i>, </b><b>Ostara Publications, 2013, $5.95 kindle download from Amazon, 88 pp.</b><b> </b></p>
<p align="center"><b><a href="http://www.projectnovaeuropa.com/">The Nova Europa Project</a></b></p>
<p>Those who attended the 2013 American Renaissance conference saw a change in mood and emphasis from previous gatherings &mdash; probably the result of watching Barack Obama coast to reelection with just 39% of the white vote. The new feeling is that the strategy of &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; whites and gaining power through democratic electoral means is not working. The demographic shift is too fast and our own progress is too slow; the opportunities we thought we saw are vanishing, and a strategic reorientation is becoming inevitable.</p>
<p>This reorientation will be toward the creation of autonomous white territories that can eventually become independent states, and Arthur Kemp&rsquo;s <i>Nova Europa</i> is a fine introduction to this subject. The starting point and greatest strength of his thinking is a firm grasp of the <i>territorial</i> nature of politics. In Mr. Kemp&rsquo;s own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Political power comes from physical occupation: not historical rights, not title deeds, not moral rights &mdash; only occupation. Those people who occupy a territory determine the nature of the society in that region.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_104586" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ArthurKemp.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104586" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ArthurKemp.jpg" alt="Rhodesian-born Arthur Kemp worked as a journalist in South Africa, where he was expelled from the Conservative Party for opposing apartheid in favor of Afrikaner separatism." width="400" height="364" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ArthurKemp.jpg 400w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ArthurKemp-300x273.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rhodesian-born, Arthur Kemp worked as a journalist in South Africa, where he was expelled from the Conservative Party for opposing apartheid in favor of Afrikaner separatism. He now lives in Britain.</p></div>
<p>In Mr. Kemp&rsquo;s view, a failure to recognize this reality was the Achilles heel of South Africa&rsquo;s apartheid system. The Afrikaner electorate believed that a stable European society could be built in a majority-black territory, and that with the right laws they could enjoy forever the benefits of cheap black labor while preventing blacks from determining the nature of South African society. Far from preventing black majority rule, this system was an incubator for it. Apartheid made whites dependent on blacks, even as it multiplied the numbers of blacks.</p>
<p>Immigrant &ldquo;rioting&rdquo; in Europe today is also to a large extent a political struggle over territory, an attempt by hostile aliens to impose their own sovereignty in areas where they are the majority. Like apartheid, the multicultural thinking that led to mass immigration is a fantasy because it ignores the fundamentally territorial nature of political power.</p>
<p>So what must whites do to ensure their physical and cultural survival? They must establish homelands where they are the majority and can protect their racial and cultural integrity. Blacks have many such homelands; the Chinese have a homeland; even Jews now have a homeland. Only white people no longer have a place to call home, and that is why only our survival is threatened.</p>
<p>When mainstream journalists discuss demographic change, they like to call it &ldquo;the mass movement of peoples,&rdquo; a conveniently neutral phrase that masks the reality that all this &ldquo;movement&rdquo; is in one direction &mdash; into white homelands. Although many whites are unaware of it, the norm in most of the world is for dominant majorities to enjoy special legal protections. As Mr. Kemp notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Japan, China, India, most sub-Saharan African states, most north African states, most middle-Eastern states and, of course, Israel, are ethnostates with varying degrees of legal enforcement designed to ensure that they keep their homogeneity.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sensible policy prevents ethnic conflicts before they can arise.</p>
<p>Even many white liberals favor such policies &mdash; as long as the beneficiaries are not white. They will happily help protect the Tibetans or the Indian tribes of the Amazon from alien incursion. Why is it so difficult for such people to see that it is fair and right for their own race to enjoy the same protections?</p>
<div id="attachment_104590" style="width: 464px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SaveTibet.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104590" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SaveTibet.jpg" alt="A cause any liberal can get behind." width="454" height="346" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SaveTibet.jpg 454w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SaveTibet-300x228.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A cause any liberal can support.</p></div>
<p>Europeans today even fit the definition of those who wear the ultimate badge of fashionable victimhood, <i>indigenous people</i>. Europeans have a continuous historical link with a particular territory, are characterized by large degree of homogeneity, and are being colonized by aliens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indigenous homelands,&rdquo; in which natives enjoy special status and protection, have been established all over the world. Brazil alone has 672 such territories; tiny Belize has found room for eight; and dozens more can be found in Australia, Canada, the United States, India, Pakistan and all over Latin America. The United Nations has issued a &ldquo;Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples&rdquo; and maintains a &ldquo;Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The permanent forum would do well to expand its horizons. As Mr. Kemp points out, for several decades now the tables have been turned, and Europeans are in retreat from the peoples they once colonized. Mr. Kemp offers the following facts:</p>
<p>• More than half the residents of Brussels, the &ldquo;capital of Europe,&rdquo; are of Third-World origin.</p>
<p>• In 2012, 53 percent of children in Viennese schools were of immigrant origin.</p>
<p>• In the United States, by 2019 a majority of schoolchildren will be non-white.</p>
<p>• The foreign population of Spain rose from 3.2 percent in 1996 to 13.4 percent 11 years later.</p>
<p>• According to a 2004 study, there were 14 million persons of foreign ancestry in France, more than 20 percent of the population.</p>
<p>• In 2009, the Dutch government reported that about 20 percent of the population had &ldquo;non-Western&rdquo; roots.</p>
<p>• A 2011 census revealed that the white share of the British population is falling by nearly 8 percent of the total each decade.</p>
<p>As Mr. Kemp notes, &ldquo;there is currently no area on earth which has been specifically set aside for European people.&rdquo; Why aren&rsquo;t the heirs of Western civilization being afforded protections routinely granted to the hunter-gatherers of the Amazon jungle?</p>
<p>It cannot be because such protection would be &ldquo;white supremacy.&rdquo; This fashionable bogeyman &mdash; imagining for a moment that anybody really advocated it &mdash; would be incompatible with the ethnic nationalism Mr. Kemp advocates: &ldquo;self-determination specifically eschews the claim to rule over others.&rdquo; Mr. Kemp &mdash; a strong critic of apartheid &mdash; argues that the demand for black self-rule in South Africa validates white self-rule in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Nor must a program of territorial independence involve any claim to superiority. Mr. Kemp argues that &ldquo;the contribution of European man to the world and the well-being of all people is unsurpassed,&rdquo; but he demands no more for his own people than he would be prepared to grant to pygmies or bushmen.</p>
<p>So far, resistance to mass, non-white immigration has come from nationalist political parties, which have tried to enter government through democratic means. Nowhere have they achieved much success. This is largely because Western democracy has, in Mr. Kemp&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;turned into rule by the wealthy elite and powerful lobbies.&rdquo; While mass immigration is unpopular among ordinary Europeans, social and political elites are fanatically committed to it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, non-whites everywhere vote as a block for the most pro-immigrant parties. Whites not only do not vote along racial lines, but even view such block-voting as somehow morally wrong. This means it is unlikely that any nationalist party will attain power within the brief time whites can be expected to retain their majorities.</p>
<p>Whites must not <i>reject</i> democratic participation. As Mr. Kemp writes, it &ldquo;remains the best and easiest way to spread the message of ethnonationalism, which is vital for any potential solution to the crisis.&rdquo; A nationalist party might yet come to power in one or more European countries and reverse the demographic crisis. Even if it occurred in only a single small country, such a development would send shock waves across the continent. The elites have good reason to fear nationalist parties.</p>
<p>But white patriots must adopt new avenues of action as well. Specifically, Mr. Kemp believes they must start building autonomous European communities wherever it is practically possible to do so, and ultimately create a European ethnostate (or states).</p>
<p>The great advantage of creating European communities is that it does not require winning over majorities. Meaningful concrete steps can be taken today by the minority of whites who understand the looming catastrophe. Eventually, such communities could become states. These communities would eventually draw from around the world Europeans who understand the genocidal consequences of multiculturalism. And where else will even liberals find neighborhoods with &ldquo;good schools&rdquo; and &ldquo;low crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The South African town of Orania is a good example of what whites must do. A small minority of Afrikaners have long shared Mr. Kemp&rsquo;s view that white reliance on black labor was ultimately responsible for the downfall of white South Africa. In 1990, as the demise of apartheid visibly approached, a group of white pioneers bought the deserted village of Orania in the Northern Cape Province for a nominal fee. They chose the town&rsquo;s barren and seemingly unpromising location for good reasons.</p>
<p>The Northern Cape, with its sparse population, presented the only area of South Africa which could effectively be colonized by Afrikaners with the least amount of disruption to the rest of the country. In 2010, the entire Northern Cape had only 2.3% of the country&rsquo;s population. Majority Afrikaner occupation could be achieved with only 500,000 or so Afrikaners moving to the area.</p>

<p>The town was founded on three principles: the Oranians were to have their <i>own land</i>, use only their <i>own labor</i>, and create their <i>own institutions</i>. From around two dozen pioneers, it has grown to a current population of over 1,500. The town boasts two schools and seventy local businesses, and is &ldquo;possibly the only local authority in all South Africa which actually balanced its books in 2012.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2004, Orania introduced its own currency, the Ora, which is a valid method of payment within the town borders. The Ora trades on par with the South African Rand and is underwritten by the local savings and credit union. The new currency keeps money within the community.</p>
<div id="attachment_104583" style="width: 577px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Orania.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104583" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Orania.jpg" alt="&quot;Welcome to the Afrikaner home.

Pay with the Ora.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>In 2012, the British <i>Sunday Times</i>, a paper not noted for white advocacy, had this to say about Orania:</p>
<blockquote><p>Building sites are everywhere. Plots of land that went for £1,000 four years ago now change hands for £20,000. There are supermarkets, all manner of other shops, a doctor, dentist, lawyers, architects, two schools and a radio station. Orania has organised many trips to Israel to study Israeli farming techniques &mdash; the Israelis too have made the desert bloom. Orania exports jewelry to the whole of South Africa, air-freighted vegetables to British supermarkets and pecan nuts to China. The community is probably the greenest in South Africa: all farming is organic, everything is recycled and alternative energy is used whenever possible. People leave their keys in their cars, live with their doors open and children play, unmonitored, in the street until dark.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_104584" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/OraniaHome.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104584" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/OraniaHome.jpg" alt="A home in Orania with a solar boiler." width="480" height="265" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/OraniaHome.jpg 480w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/OraniaHome-300x165.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A home in Orania with a solar hot-water heater.</p></div>
<p>The <i>Sunday Times</i> reports that the Orania Council pays a £1,000 ($1,600) grant for every child born in the town. Local guide John Strydom says: &ldquo;Recently growth has become explosive. It&rsquo;s stretching us in every sinew. Our present land can house 25,000 people, but of course we&rsquo;ll buy more land.&rdquo; Not everyone thinks this is the best course; town founder Carel Boshoff says: &ldquo;Expansion here may not be the right way. We need another Orania on the West Coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The town&rsquo;s greatest obstacle remains convincing fellow-Afrikaners to give up the short-term advantages of &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; black labor. As Mr. Kemp notes, white pioneers outside South Africa would not have this problem.</p>
<div id="attachment_104588" style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Flag.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104588" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Flag.jpg" alt="The official flag of Orania." width="420" height="316" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Flag.jpg 420w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Flag-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The official flag of Orania.</p></div>
<p>Another case study Mr. Kemp recommends is Israel, the world&rsquo;s only avowed ethnostate. Theodor Hertzel was not the first to advocate a modern Jewish nation, but his 1896 book <i>The Jewish State</i> offered the first coherent plan for one.</p>
<p>The very next year the First Zionist Congress met in Basel to promote colonization. In 1901, the Jewish National Fund was created to buy land in Palestine. At the same time, a formal office for the Zionist Organization was established in Palestine to develop Jewish agriculture, settlement, education, land, finance, and immigration.</p>
<p>In 1917, Britain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Balfour Declaration&rdquo; gave formal recognition at the international level of the Zionist effort and undertook to set aside parts of Palestine for a national home for the Jewish people. By 1923, 40,000 Jews had migrated to Palestine; by 1939 another 382,000 had arrived; several hundred thousand more came during the war and the early post-war period. On 14 May 1948, the state of Israel declared independence. All this happened within 53 years of Herzl&rsquo;s publishing his tract!</p>
<div id="attachment_104592" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TheodorHerzl.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104592" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TheodorHerzl.jpg" alt="TheodorHerzl" width="438" height="502" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TheodorHerzl.jpg 438w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TheodorHerzl-261x300.jpg 261w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Theodor Herzl</p></div>
<p>Whites can learn a great deal from the Zionist example, not all of it positive. Israel illustrates the danger of choosing a territory that requires displacement of a different (and subsequently hostile) group. If the territory we select is not largely empty, like South Africa&rsquo;s Northern Cape, then it must already have a strong white majority.</p>
<p>On the positive side, as Mr. Kemp notes, the Zionist movement demonstrated good practical sense in providing prospective settlers with economic opportunities.</p>
<p>People &mdash; even the most ideologically dedicated &mdash; will not move anywhere unless they are able to earn a living. The Zionists knew that once the small beachhead had been established, the very first priority was to create a substantial infrastructure which would provide newcomers with a means to make a living.</p>
<p>Orania, by contrast, got off to a slow start because it did not have anything comparable. For the first several years it attracted only affluent retirees.</p>
<p><b>What about Europeans?</b></p>
<p>Ironically, there are more people of European descent alive today than ever before in history. Yet, in the face of hostile non-white intrusion the majority seem capable of nothing more than running away to the ever-diminishing &ldquo;good neighborhoods&rdquo; left in their countries. As Mr. Kemp writes, &ldquo;a &lsquo;mass exodus&rsquo; to a European homeland, if it comes at all, will come only long after the formerly European nations are totally overrun.&rdquo; Even then, many whites would rather disappear through childlessness, miscegenation, or eventual physical extermination by the more violent elements of other races.</p>
<p>Mr. Kemp notes that there are many whites-&ldquo;ignorant, apathetic, small-minded whites&rdquo;-we will never save. &ldquo;Brutally put,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;we are better off without them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most difficult step in creating a European ethnostate, then, is mustering the will. Once a significant number of whites achieves this, the next step would be the creation of a colonization company that would coordinate fundraising, buy land, create businesses, and organize immigration. Mr. Kemp notes that many professional services can now be delivered from anywhere on earth. The revolution in communications technology means setting up colonies would be much easier than in the Age of Exploration.</p>
<p>After mustering the political will, the second most difficult question is choosing and colonizing a territory. There are two approaches. One is to select a small town or region within an existing threatened Western state. The goal would be to build up a series of towns or regions that could at a later stage form a contiguous, independent state.</p>
<p>Colonization efforts should be directed toward filling a region with racially conscious Europeans attuned to the project, not simply relying on an existing white population; there is no use in having a European majority, as in Vermont, for example, that is hostile to the project. For more on this strategy, I recommend John Hunt Morgan&rsquo;s article &ldquo;<a href="/ar/2004/11/index.html#cover">Building White Communities</a>&rdquo; in the November, 2004 issue of <i>American Renaissance</i>.</p>
<p>The other approach is to target a demographically suitable and receptive nation. Eastern Europe is promising. Apart from significant Gypsy and Turkish populations, non-whites tend to comprise no more than two percent in the region. Russia&rsquo;s non-European population is significant, but largely concentrated in the South and Siberia. Of course, Eastern Europe owes its freedom from mass non-white immigration to its isolation as part of the Soviet bloc and to its relative poverty. As it recovers and prospers, it will attract immigrants. On the other hand, many of these countries are suspicious of Western liberalism, and some even have governments that are aware of European decline and low birth rates.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as Herzl wrote, the territory will be determined by what can be realistically obtained and by common consensus among those who want to create the ethnostate.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Kemp reminds us:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he demand for a European homeland is nothing less than the right which is accorded all other peoples on earth. If it is presented fairly, without hate or denigration of others, it will find accord with reasonably-minded people of all races.</p></blockquote>

The industry of the north was heavily reliant on the inputs (textiles, and raw materials)from the south to make the economy work. Nothing is more fundamental in war than competition over resources! Lincoln framed it as an emotional argument. Federal rights over the states rights. The same thing happened on a smaller scale during the whiskey rebellion after the revolutionary war. Feds wanted their taxes.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-327815" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Exactly. The greedy Northern capitalists won the war. They did not care about working Whites in the North or the South. A White populist party, like the Southern Democrats of old, is what we need these days. These greedy Northern capitalists invited the Negroes North to ruin our cities because they were a cheap labor source. They had no compunction about turning the worlds of most of our forebears upside down. Life was hard in the factories, but the working class White European Immigrants had built good communities. They were poor but proud, and people took care of each other. The greedy factory owners were the ones who invited the Bantus to our cities, because they only cared about cheap labor. They didn&rsquo;t care if the Negroes were going to destroy nice Polish, Italian, and Slovak neighborhoods that were free of crime.<br/>
One commonly held misconception is that aforementioned capitalistic greed was a distinctively Jewish ideology. The capitalistic greed thing was not a Jewish plot. Andrew Carnegie was not Jewish. He was a Scottish immigrant. Most of the wealthy back then were of English descent, New England Yankee ancestry, and the New England Anglo-Celtic culture was not to blame for their greed either. Greed was to blame, and it was not condoned by any of our European Nationalities. If there is any lesson we White racial realists need to glean from this Greed, I think it is that we must not allow greed to become the queen of our hearts. In a new White homeland, one of our focused should be an equitable distribution of wealth. While there should certainly be a wealthy class, wealth above a certain, sensible level should be used to enhance the community at large. Handouts should not be available, but there is nothing wrong with the wealthiest enhancing their community with their extra funds, provided this is done in a racially homogenous environment. This philosophy was the original reasoning for our &#8220;safety net&#8221; in the Northern states, and it works well at its&rsquo; intended purpose in the absence of non-Whites. Incorporate non-Whites, especially Negroes, and the safety net becomes a hammock. This is what they have done in the Great Lakes States. A safety net is fine, but only works in a homogenous White European society with European values, where folks believe in hard work, and do not have a bogus sense of entitlement, as Negroes do.</p>

We Northerners need to form a strong racial realist community with our Southern Brethren in Negro free areas in the Southern mountains, and invite racial realist White Southerners from the lowlands to join us, along with all White racial realists who want to build our European American Zion, free of Negroes and other non-Whites, and, most importantly, all of their cultural influences. Rap and Hip-Hop Culture or Drug Use should be treated as grounds for expulsion in such a community, expulsion back to diversity Hell!! In such a community, European culture and behavior, and European culture and behavior only should be acceptable. Judeo-Christian values only, no Muslims allowed, and churches teaching a proper abhorrence of any kind of racial integration, homosexuality, and fornication. A return to truly European culture in all ways.<br/>
As Dixie currently stands, I could surely see West Virginia, and possibly Eastern Kentucky/Tennessee/Northern Alabama, along with the rest of the Appalachian South forming one state. The rest of the South, though, is too mired with Negroes, and had taken the wrong approach in recent years on the Negro problem.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-417572" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Forgive the time travel, but you are saying things with these posts that I find confusing. First of all, as Americans we are not interested in forming enclaves that restrict our rights. If anything we want the exact opposite. If you&rsquo;re going to tell me what kind of music I can&rsquo;t listen to, will you also restrict me from reading the black blogs and news sites I study? I do this so I will know what&rsquo;s in their minds, not because I&rsquo;m trying to become one of them. HUGE difference in the perception of cultural exposure.</p>
<p>I happen to like being free to discuss any subject. Including the massive cultural rift between white and black Americans. And largely because of the attitudes of the blacks after decades of leftist indoctrination. </p>
<p>In another post you suggested that this white ethnic enclave be dedicated to equality of wealth. That too is an odd place to go for people from a nation built on opportunity equality and benefits derived from work and production. The &#8220;equality&#8221; you speak of, where will it lie? Do we build towns with a minimal sized house and assign one to everyone? Then we use the collective tax machine to balance it all out? Every 10 blocks we should put in a grocery store and a park so residents can stay fit. </p>
<p>While I like the overall utopian concept in many ways, it ignores true human nature. And I don&rsquo;t mean the instinctive kind we ma be born with. I am speaking of the human nature you absorb from being raised as an American. This is where Obama has it wrong on so many levels. The left is in a rush to reach their utopia as fast as possible. No matter what the cost. For them human culture is clay to be molded and f#cked with. They think we should all be the same. So they think forcing us to live together will bring this about faster. It didn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>But leftists will never admit hey are wrong. As an American I am more inclined to continue living under constitutional law. However, I am for removing all language justifying or mandating preferences for people under the government. We all make our own bed in America.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-429875" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I am certainly not in favor of a socialistic society. I am in favor of an all White, culturally European society. In such a society, there would of course still be a wealthy class, poorer class, and a middle class. Socialism stifles creativity and discourages innovation, two of the hallmarks of any European society, and two of the bedrock reasons why European societies are great. Utilizing that abilities of each individual, not stifling them and insisting on conformity, made our European societies great. Look at what socialism did to Eastern Europe. Individualism and allowing us to explore and develop our individual talents is at the core of European culture. In an all White European enclave, we need to purify our culture of all Negroid elements, so that we can get back to fulfilling our God given destiny. Whites who are not talented musicians, for example, but who can create inferior Negro quality music, should be put back in their rightful place in society. A person like Eminem needs clean floors and toilets for a living, and real musicians need to again step to the fore as celebrities. Low IQ individuals need to be returned to their rightful place as basic laborers, and the truly gifted need to step to the fore. We need to return to a society where men like Bach and Mozart are celebrities, and idiots like Eminem, should they want to join a racially homogenous White society, occupy their rightful place as basic laborers. Not only should Negroes not be welcome in such a homogenous society, Negro culture should be cleansed away, at it is inferior. The embrace of Negro style musicianship by the American masses has destroyed our appreciation of real music in America. Not only do the Negroes need to go. Their culture needs to go as well in an all White, racial realist enclave. The whole point in such an enclave should be to not just protect ourselves from miscegenation, but to rebuild our culture. Rap garbage, and the raucous, ugly, unrefined singing and sloppy instrumental techniques of the Negro need to be cleansed. The stranglehold of inferior Negro culture on Whites should have no place whatsoever in a White racial realist enclave. If not, what is the point? It is not enough to merely segregate. American culture in general is heavily Negrofied, and this needs to be cleansed out of our White culture in any sort of racial realist, all White enclave, and needs to be done so consciously. Those who have an appetite for such culture should either be expected to refine their tastes, or should stay behind in diversity hell with the Negroes that they are worshiping.</p>

Affirmative action jobs and college placement based on race causes conflict, for instance. Affirmative action set-asides won&rsquo;t flip when whites become the minority either, because whites will still have the skills, education, and wealth that minorities cannot acquire despite decades of redistribution. This example is only one of many that demonstrates how race identity creates conflict. This conflict will only intensify as mass immigration and white economic and cultural dispossession continue. </p>

<p>#2 My point is - Why the United States? Especially if we&rsquo;re talking about creating new communities which would be relatively small in number. If the people are already fighting against the government, it might be possible&hellip;but read our news today. People are letting the government take every liberty we have away from us.</p>
<p>There are other countries in the same hemisphere where you can essentially buy your independence. You can buy land and pay off the government and they will leave you alone. The United States government will never leave any independent minded people alone. NEVER. And if you start building a new community, a new homeland elsewhere, you would eventually have the numbers and the power (all forms) to hold onto said homeland even if/when the host government decides they no longer want you there.</p>
<p>Learn from what happened to South Africa. Produce everything in your communities, because trade will always be cutoff by the rulers of the world. Do not intermingle with other peoples, but have one solid, contiguous territory. Produce your own armaments, rather than buying them.</p>
<p>See where I&rsquo;m coming from? </p>
<p>Another fact which should be noted - Supposedly the U.S. military was trounced in Vietnam&hellip;we could have ended the entire war in less than a week by bombarding North Vietnam..by killing their army and leadership at home. The people in power have reasons for dragging out wars and &#8220;being defeated&#8221; even when they aren&rsquo;t.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-296303" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Reasonable response. Allow me to elucidate.</p>
<p>1. The IRA were able to hold off the British Army with just a few guns and guts, without resorting to blowing themselves up. Nor did the British EVER consider using Nuclear weapons on the Irish. (Well they probably did in their fevered imaginations, but never publicly).</p>
<p>2. The Northwest is perfect for resistance and for acquiring. Huge amounts of space, islands, water, forests, mountains, several excellent deep water harbors, reasonable climate, excellent crop yields, far from the base of power (Washington D.C.). The Northwest Front plan is the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and about half of Montana. Several groups, Montana Rifleman included, are already considered neutral if not friendly. Already Brigades (three man cells) are being formed.</p>
<p>3. There is evidence (Kenniwick Man) that Whites have always been here, going back as far as 9000 to 14,000 years (pre-Meizto Indian). See: The Solutrean Hypothesis. If not on the North American continent, where we were once and then driven back to the sea, killed off and then triumphantly returned&hellip;Where?</p>
<p>Lastly, to put the issue of overwhelming force aside for a second. If the Government WERE to use atomic devices against, say Seattle, would that not completely de-legitimize the Federal Government as any kind of &#8220;protector&#8221; of the people? Would it not require the people to ride up and destroy it?</p>

<p>If people break any law or regulation of the United States, few will come out in support of them, even when the law/regulation is immoral and unconstitutional.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see massive support until the government really starts rounding people, from all walks of life, up for questioning the government.</p>
<p>Now overwhelming force..man I was just referring to the ridiculously huge air force we have. The tanks. The missiles. The helicopters. The drones. MILLIONS of troops, including so many many reservists and National Guardsmen. They have already turned their guns on Americans before when their Commander in Chief ordered them to do so.</p>
<p>I personally would prefer not to leave this country, since my damn ancestors helped to make this country. Out of every branch of my family, the latest immigrants came in the 1830s I believe. But I&rsquo;m also a realist&hellip;I see that the natives of this land have lost all power to, in many cases, descendants of European socialists who arrived in the late 19th or early 20th centuries, as well as foreigners and the children of foreigners.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Regarding the IRA&hellip;man Fenian socialism is probably a derivative of Fabian socialism. The government in Ireland today supports African immigration to Ireland. Same bunch controlling them.</p>

Also, the USA had a system of quotas for Whites too for each of the different White countries. This way, you wouldn&rsquo;t have too many people from one country coming in all at once and turning the country into their old homeland. Limiting the numbers from each country allowed people to assimilate, not colonize.</p>

populations in most white countries didn&rsquo;t force people to confront<br/>
their differences on a regular basis. The fact is, people are not interchangeable. There are clear differences between races, and we&rsquo;d all do well to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>A homogeneous group left to its own devices is likely to experience life richly. Its members can share their existence with others who have similar experiences, culture, interests and biological tendencies. There will be a greater sense of community and understanding within the group, and it can be run more efficiently as well. A diverse group, on the other hand, will have more disparate needs and desires, and trying to please everyone becomes a matter of reducing everything to the lowest common denominator, which ends up pleasing no one in the end.</p>
<p>The Irish, Germans and Italians were able to assimilate to America more easily due to the fact that they were white in a predominantly white country. While they may have had some differences in background, their shared race meant that there was less of a gap to cross when adapting. They had more in common with each other than any non-white did with any of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about hate, it&rsquo;s about doing what&rsquo;s best for people. Most people want to live peaceful, productive lives, and community with others who share their values, goals and worldview is one of the best ways to achieve that.</p>

The word prejudice comes from the two words &#8220;pre&#8221; and &#8220;judge&#8221;. Anyone who forms an opinion on something without having first acquainted him or herself of the facts, is not only &#8220;pre-judiced&#8221; but also mad, No-one in their right mind takes an opinion or a decision of import without having acquainted themselves of the facts.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-296061" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Interesting arguments from Arthur Kemp.<br/>
I just have one problem with his analysis. If &#8216;White homelands&rsquo; are established, what is stopping the &#8216;old cycle&rsquo;, (ie &#8216;low scale&rsquo; third world immigration eventually starts which myseriously morphs into full-blown takeover in a space of decades), from re=asserting itself?<br/>
It seems to me that Whites have a unique genetic psychological deficit that prevents them from taking the utterly harsh, ruthless and selfish action that needs to be taken, (ie an absolute constitutional perpetual prohibition on non-White settlement in the &#8216;homelands&rsquo;), that are the essential non-negotiable founding characteristic of the &#8216;homeland&rsquo;. I fear that we will revert to type and the soft hearts and soft heads of the falsely &#8216;compassionate&rsquo; will gradually, in the course of time, turn Whites&rsquo; minds away from the founding principle - in the name of charity - and in due course leave us exactly as we are today.<br/>
As a pre-requisite, something like the Indian caste system where &#8216;race&rsquo; is given a quasi-religious significance must be inculcated in the minds of the puportive citizens of the new ethno-state.</p>

<p>If there are too many whites in an area. . that area needs to get more diverse, and it&rsquo;s a sign of residual evil. . it&rsquo;s just a momumental coincidence, however, a strange fluke that folks from thousands of miles away all landed in the exact same neighborhood or side of town, and it&rsquo;s just great then that there is little diversity and few or no whites or if that area is becoming less white or an area where their are virtually no whites.

It was a very ordinary election in the normal flow of Presidential politics, in which only once since the start of the twentieth century (Jimmy Carter) has a party been turned out of the White House after only four years. And the changes in Congressional makeup were below average for a Presidential re-election.</p>
<p>The promises of the Obama platform are not sustainable. Once it stops being tenable (and legitimate) to fault GW Bush for the state of the economy, the inherent contradictions of the diversity coalition will blow up.</p>

We(yes, I&rsquo;m even including myself) spend far too little time talking about the practical, short-term solutions needed to bring about a remedy. We spend even less time actually <i>doing</i> the things that need to be done.</p>
<p>For example, look at AmRen articles. Nine out of ten, possibly 99 out of 100 articles are about the symptoms, with the comments just repeating various forms of disgust and repeating the symptoms. When an article comes along that talks about organization and possible steps to a practical solution, what do we get? We get comments that talk about the symptoms again, defeatist attitudes that tell us why it can&rsquo;t be done, and an infinite number of ways to attach labels to what someone believes has caused this mess. Never optimistic solutions or practical steps that make it easy for current and possible pro-White people to do some physical activism in the REAL world.</p>

<p>However, Africans do not assimilate as well among Europeans. Their main problem is their lower average IQ, which means that they cannot compete on equal terms with Europeans, which in turn means that they are less able to make a living in European societies. The only way they can compete is if they are helped with affirmative action. That leads to resentment among those who are expected to compete without such assistance.</p>

<p>Secondly, this is, as Nova Europa correct says, one of the most important lessons to be learned from Israel, where the Jews created an ethnostate by expelling an existing population-and thereby earning the perpetual hatred of its neighbors. Quote from Nova Europa: &#8220;The Israeli lesson teaches us that a state born in hate, supremacy, and violence, begets all that and more back.&#8221;</p>

Long past are the days a citizen militia could engage the government in battle successfully. Today it&rsquo;s a one-way ticket to the graveyard or worse. Go ahead and point your pea shooter at a missile armed drone and see who wins. I don&rsquo;t think you will be around to tell us how it worked out. </p>
<p>The ONLY way you can succeed in creating a white ethno-state is to pioneer land presently uninhabited. And yes, such places DO still exist, but they will take a HUGE amount of courage and hard work to carve out. </p>

Even if the total figure is 64%, (which it isn&rsquo;t), the additional complication is the age spread: the vast majority of the young are of Third World origin. By 2019-JUST SIX YEARS AWAY-the majority of under 18s in America will be non-white.This means that as the older generations die off-which will start occurring within the next 10 - 20 years, the population shift will become even more rapid.<br/>
In addition, non-whites are already the majority of live births, and this figure increases exponentially every year.<br/>
It will be very surprising if, within the next 20 years, whites still form a majority in the US at all.</p>
<p>We need to start planning for that scenario now. There is no alternative.</p>

In order to get actual demographics, ALL American citizens need to be counted and the census needs to separate citizen vs not. The true racial makeup of the USA is only it&rsquo;s citizens.</p>

So the &#8220;64%&#8221; if that&rsquo;s an accurate number, is quite correct. The &#8220;40 million illegals&#8221; no matter how much we wish for it, aren&rsquo;t leaving. I&rsquo;d bet my life savings we can&rsquo;t stop them bringing every third cousin and in-law either. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well past time to face facts and not what &#8220;should be&#8221; or what we&rsquo;d &#8220;like to be&#8221; true. </p>
<p>The traitors destroyed our Nation in 1965. It&rsquo;s been a slow-motion train wreck ever since, but a train wreck nonetheless. I recall as a boy in the early 1970&rsquo;s, my very liberal mother telling me that I would one day be a minority in my country and I should therefore be tolerant of minorities now. They knew what they were doing when they did it. Everyone did. Our parents and grandparents destroyed our legacy. </p>
<p>Now, if we want our children and grandchildren to have a country in which they may be safe, we must act. Not wish.. Not hope.. But act and act decisively. Our forebears came here from elsewhere. We must match that courage and build a new home for our progeny. Then we must defend it VERY forcefully. </p>

With the state of the modern media, She would have everything to gain, and nothing to lose, by accusing any fellow Jew who is stuck living near Blacks, and who angrily vents about the Schvarza, of being &#8220;a racist&#8221;, and everything to lose by standing up and speaking with pride about her heritage, and defending the rights of American Jews to keep their neighborhoods White. In a sensible world, She would reinforce, with other American Jews, that White European Gentiles created the American culture, and that this is the culture they should respect most, and where they are &#8220;safest&#8221;. She would reinforce that the Schvarza are an alien race predisposed to violence and sociopathy. She would point out that it is the White European Gentile culture in America that allows American Jews to live in quiet, safe, clean neighborhoods, and remind them of what life is like in Israel, surrounded by Muslim hordes. She would remind them of why New York was so nice in the old days. Almost entirely White and Judeo-Christian.</p>

She also doesn&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s behind about the working class folks who are not wealthy enough to move away from the Schvarza. She also knows that, if She sticks up for Jackie Mason when he points out that Negroids are Schvarza, or defends the rights of her Jewish brethren in a traditionally Jewish neighborhood to keep their neighborhood White, She might not experience social approval from Oprah or Whoopi.<br/>
If Babs really cared about her fellow Jewish Americans, She would point out that folks in places like Skokie, Illinois have every right to keep their neighborhood White, and to maintain their Jewish culture, and would point out how Whoopi Goldberg is a first class example of the evils of miscegenation, as She is a Black first and foremost, and doesn&rsquo;t care anymore about her smidge of Jewish descent than Obama does about his Mother&rsquo;s family being Irish. Most likely, though, Babs is like most wealthy folks, and doesn&rsquo;t really care about helping her working class brethren. She could try to get Jewish Libtards tuned into reality, into how self destructive their support of Negroes is, and encourage her brethren to respect White Gentiles, first and foremost, and to realize that their heroes should be racial realists like Robert Weissberg.</p>

That is when this racial realist moves, and why, in the current environment, we White racial realists need to start planning our White homeland. Too many Whites out there will begin by rejoicing when they move in, naively thinking this will &#8220;broaden their horizons&#8221;, but will, in short order, realize how naïve they have been all of their lives. They will be shocked that, yes, maybe that Black guy is raising his children, and maybe he is a Doctor, but somehow, the kids still act like their &#8220;brothas and sistas&#8221; in the ghetto. Hmmm&hellip;how did that happen?? Suddenly, these Liberals realize that their White racial realist friends are not &#8220;right wingers&#8221;, &#8220;hillbillies&#8221;, or &#8220;bigots&#8221;, but simply intelligent, sensible people who are cognizant of the distinct behavioral differences amongst the races. We are realists, who realize that race is surely not a social construct, and that the different races of humans have different basic temperaments and behavioral patterns. They may even realize that Negroes, as a race, just tend to be more violent than us Caucasians. They have a meaner spirit about them, and this cannot be explained by any time of supposed &#8220;racism&#8221; that we have inflicted on them. This is why, in our absence, levels of violence prevail amongst them which we find abhorrent. Such violence is not abhorrent to them, it is just acting naturally.</p>

Israel illustrates the danger of choosing a territory that requires displacement of a different (and subsequently hostile) group. If the territory we select is not largely empty, like South Africa&rsquo;s Northern Cape, then it must already have a strong white majority.</p>
<p>- F. Roger Devlin, American Renaissance, June 21, 2013</p>
<p>The Zionist example is not very inspiring. Israel has had to defeat three efforts by the Arab world to destroy Israel and kill all the Jews there. The Israelis endure a chronic state of low intensity warfare against their existence, and periodic UN resolutions. </p>
<p>A &#8220;strong white majority&#8221; will almost certainly be composed of sanctimonious white liberals who do not know many blacks or very much about them. I used to be that way until I was robbed at gunpoint, mugged, and nearly murdered by blacks.</p>

The international boycott of South African athletes, for example, fell on blacks as well as whites. I think this is other side of the forced process which created the &#8220;new&#8221; South Africa. How can you make it work when some large portion of the majority population does not, itself, believe in the creed of Anglo-Saxon liberty and Anglo-Saxon fair play which was the foundation of democracy in both the United States and the Commonwealth?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-297010" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Orania town is a privately-owned company. It does not have any racial restrictions, though, for two reasons: 1, It is illegal to discriminate on race in terms of South African law; and 2. They are not going to give the state any legal mechanism with which to attack.<br/>
On a South African TV interview, the head of Orania was once asked what would happen if a black man tried to move into Orania. The answer was &#8220;nothing, but it has never happened.&#8221; There are two reasons for this:<br/>
1. The dominant culture in the town would make him an outsider;<br/>
2. There is nothing in the town, or even surrounding it, for hundreds of miles, which could serve as an attraction for blacks to move there-even if they were bused in.<br/>
This is why Orania gets left alone-it is just too far away from the black epicenters for them to bother with.<br/>
This is discussed in detail in the Nova Europa book, and the comparison with Israel is clear: no state can be founded in a territory which is not suitable, either in terms of existing demographic make-up, or in which an already existing alien population is present and has to be expelled: that will unquestionably bring down a counter-reaction.<br/>
The last valid question is, of course, what about the long term? As Orania gets more and more successful, will it not attract the authorities&rsquo; ire?<br/>
Yes it will, but there is another law at work as well: as the state becomes more and more Third Worldized, it becomes less capable of doing anything except guarding the president&rsquo;s palace. This process will also be at work in the US, eventually.</p>

<p>The citizens of Orania are Christian Zionists. They see the Jews as their allies. They refuse to acknowledge the Jewish role in the destruction of Apartheid South Africa. This means that Orania will ultimately fail. When you allow Jews into your homeland they will eventually subvert it from within. This is why i and many other like me will never move to Orania.</p>

Apartheid failed, not because of the &#8220;Jews&#8221;, (even though Jews were predominant in anti-Apartheid activity) but because whites in South Africa refused to acknowledge the relationship between political power and demography. They though they could use the blacks as labor to do EVERYTHING   &mdash;   but then expected them not to demand political power.<br/>
Apartheid, by its nature, like all segregation, was doomed to destruction by its own inherent contradictions.<br/>
You really need to take a fresh, sober, assessment of why White South Africa came to a fall, and stop blaming others.</p>

It cannot be because such protection would be &ldquo;white supremacy.&rdquo; This fashionable bogeyman &mdash; imagining for a moment that anybody really advocated it &mdash; would be incompatible with the ethnic nationalism Mr. Kemp advocates: &ldquo;self-determination specifically eschews the claim to rule over others.&rdquo; Mr. Kemp &mdash; a strong critic of apartheid &mdash; argues that the demand for black self-rule in South Africa validates white self-rule in Europe and North America.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Yet if &#8216;the others&rsquo; are a member of the local population, you must indeed &#8216;rule over them&rsquo; to get them to leave the wealth you would create for yourself. If you are unwilling to define what you want in life as the /kind/ of society you and your fellow whites will achieve, without ethnic aid, you are a coward who doesn&rsquo;t understand that supremacy is that the heart of the issue. What&rsquo;s better for us is not better for them. Hence it is White Superior.</p>
<p>This is a key issue because failure to note it is a failure to plan for the future. Whites who tout past achievements don&rsquo;t want a white future, solely wholely and ONLY for themselves. The past is dead. The present lives next door to us as unwanted neighbors. The future will be one where we are the ones &#8216;politely or otherwise encouraged to leave&rsquo;. The living world.</p>
<p>And the reason is that genetic algorithms drive instinctive behaviors which are about inclusion only so long as it advantages them to play Cuckoo (bird that lays it&rsquo;s eggs in another&rsquo;s nest for a different species to raise for them). As soon as white society starts to collape, black and Hispanic genetic algorithms will move to the polar opposite: wiping out the weakest competitor to enjoin their resources to their own.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
The most difficult step in creating a European ethnostate, then, is mustering the will. Once a significant number of whites achieves this, the next step would be the creation of a colonization company that would coordinate fundraising, buy land, create businesses, and organize immigration. Mr. Kemp notes that many professional services can now be delivered from anywhere on earth. The revolution in communications technology means setting up colonies would be much easier than in the Age of Exploration.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Rubbish. Distance across the Atlantic made Colonial America possible because it encouraged both separation from immediate oversight and enforcement of prohibitions against own-technology based development. If someone doesn&rsquo;t get what they need from a distant government, they tend to improvise on their own.</p>
<p>That degree of enablement of innovation through improvisation is rebellious because it rapidly frees itself from artificial limiters (patents, copyrights, tariffs and taxes) which would otherwise keep profits flowing only one way. This is why China generally respects no commercial process as sacred unto itself. This is why China has a 6,000 person dedicated hacker force as well as the computer servers to hack the entire world wide web, datamining -hours- worth of bandwidth at a time.</p>
<p>Now, with this as a given, how long do you think it would be before someone who &#8216;heard from a source who heard from a friend&rsquo; that we were building X as knockoffs would come running lest THE MYTH of &#8216;cheaper from China&rsquo; was exposed as what it really is:</p>
<p>An attempt to create inefficiency as thermodynamic waste and /profit/ from that waste as &#8216;every job created is another chance to own stock in someone else&rsquo;s labor&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If you are not willing to STEAL from your sponsoring state as nation the assets you need to make a new one, you aren&rsquo;t thinking far enough ahead on the &#8220;We won&rsquo;t let you go lest you prove a better way for all the others to follow!&#8221; cause:effect chain.</p>
<p>Point Blank: when whites go, we had better take nuclear weapons with us. Because that will be the only way by which we can stave off Cavalry Chases Geronimo pursuit and the very nearness of everyone&rsquo;s virtual presence will be what makes it impossible to just &#8216;slink away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
The other approach is to target a demographically suitable and receptive nation. Eastern Europe is promising. Apart from significant Gypsy and Turkish populations, non-whites tend to comprise no more than two percent in the region. Russia&rsquo;s non-European population is significant, but largely concentrated in the South and Siberia. Of course, Eastern Europe owes its freedom from mass non-white immigration to its isolation as part of the Soviet bloc and to its relative poverty. As it recovers and prospers, it will attract immigrants. On the other hand, many of these countries are suspicious of Western liberalism, and some even have governments that are aware of European decline and low birth rates.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t bring money and jobs and your own infrastructure with you, don&rsquo;t count on a warm welcome. Europe is doomed by it&rsquo;s EU connected currency as debt servicing status. The border and backland states of Spain, Greece, Portugal, Ireland and the like are having their debt service bought out in trade for the wiping out of their own population unities. That these debts were often /created/ by leveraged currency as trade fraud and that such &#8216;preferential treatment&rsquo; will once again be inflicted on any who try to leave the EU or at least it&rsquo;s currency is a given.</p>
<p>The failure of EU-rope is the contrast between Hitler and Capitalism: Hitler wanted a unified racial homeland and would never have considered, for any reason, a shift to multi-racialism as a means to break down the nationalist as genetic sympathies of it&rsquo;s peoples.</p>
<p>Capitalist socialism uses the profit motive to undermine WHO WE ARE was a nation to destroy our allegiance to the state. And so replace it with something that is self conceived in Brussels as replacing whites to unify Europe. Europe doesn&rsquo;t live as a culture.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>And so replacing the living people with an organizational fixture as label, EU-rope commits genocide against whites to retain a white definition of power as it&rsquo;s own purpose, such as Hitler himself couldn&rsquo;t possibly imagine.</p>
<p>You shove that reality in the faces of everyone. You _Tell Them_ that the Council Of Ministers in Brussels (which is _not_ the capital of Europe) is out to do to them and their children what Hitler tried to do to the Jews. Solely to preserve it&rsquo;s own power.</p>
<p>And when that reality strikes them, you give them the weapons as international petitions for secession to get out of the EU-rabian death mill before the modern Nazis not only kill them all. But replace them with Southwest Asians as Islam.</p>

Many of the white liberals in South Africa who voted against Apartheid, have changed their views radically. They no longer have the luxury of an all-white neighbourhood and all white schools. Before they were exposed to the real facts they believed everything liberal media was telling them. Remember, during Apartheid dissident voices WERE allowed. Liberal American propaganda was shown on TV in Apartheid South Africa. &#8220;The Cosby Show&#8221; became a favourite among white South Africans during Apartheid.<br/>
Many liberal radio stations funded by certain people were spreading this propaganda. There were liberal newspapers as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite remarkable actually since most people assume all dissent voices were banned in Apartheid South Africa like they were in Nazi Germany, but it wasn&rsquo;t the case. Retrospectively they should have been banned. If you allow the enemy to spread their propaganda, they will eventually erode the spirit of the nation. The Apartheid government wasn&rsquo;t authoritarian enough in my opinion.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-327803" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Excellent read!! Very impressed from all angles. A good, realistic take on Zionism, and what we can learn from it, and an excellent depiction of Orania, two great examples of what we, as White racial realists, can build for ourselves.<br/>
We have so many advantages here in America. We already have huge areas of our country that are entirely to almost entirely White, already have an established White European culture, and are not in close proximity to the present Negroid or Mestizo enclaves. In these areas, we do not have a local alien population to displace, and would not even have enclaves of aliens close by. If a lovely, peaceful community like Orania can be built on the dark continent, we can build one here in almost any part of the rural West, Midwest, or Northeast. The Mormons built there Zion in Utah, and what a great place they built.<br/>
The primary thing that we lack is the hearts and minds of our people. It seems simple, but it is not. So few Whites in America are racially aware, and most of us who are had a racial awakening by having to deal with Blacks, or possibly other non-Whites, and having negative experiences which woke us from the lies the media propagates. As such, most of our almost all White areas tend to be like Vermont. The Woodstock Generation has gone off the deep end with their bogus beliefs about people being the same wherever one goes. They are seniors themselves now, but many are more set than ever in their bogus beliefs which are grounded in rebelling against their racial realist parents. They are galvanized in believing that miscegenation and integration are the answer to America&rsquo;s race problems, because they have never experienced what non-Whites are really like. Most of these aging Baby Boomers never went to school with Blacks, even in college, at least not in large enough numbers to catch onto the fact that the Negroes have a very different temperament from us.<br/>
Other than lack of exposure to Blacks, though, has been the key issue of being divided. The North/South divide in this country is still alive and well, and, in my opinion, is the key element here. A house divided always falls. As a White racial realist from the North, I know that Northerners made their worst mistake when we saw Southerners as a &#8220;them&#8221;, instead of our White European American Brethren. The &#8220;them&#8221; was the Negroes, and Southerners knew their temperament. If we had listened to our Southern Brethren, we Northerners would have secured our Northern States as our White homeland during the civil rights movement, sent the Negroes back South, and offered asylum and quality of life to any of our Southern Brethren wanting to escape the Negro scourge down South. We would have preserved our cities for our people, and welcomed our Southern Brethren to join us in building our Pan-European Zion here in the Midwest and Northeast.<br/>
But, what is done is done. I live near a Midwestern City that was once a clean, safe, pan-European place that was destroyed by Negroes. Everyone I know around here over 80 years old is a racial realist, and is under no illusions as to who destroyed their city, and is honest about this. Unfortunately, most folks under 70 years old will give them argument on this. The folks under 70, of course, are too young to remember living in a now majority Black city when it was almost entirely White, and was safe and clean. The folks over 80 remember this. Before I digress further, though, key point is that, in an area such as where I live, it would be pointless to try to build a White homeland. The burbs and outlying areas are mostly White and still nice, but there is not enough White racial realist sentiment to even bother. Too many Baby Boomers clinging to the naïve dreams of their youth, and feeling self righteous thinking that their parents were &#8220;racists&#8221; to just go ahead and tune into reality. The cities now dominated by the violent Bantu hordes are too destroyed, and too far gone for us to even consider wasting time fretting over them. The best thing to do is get the heck away from these areas, and focus on building our White homelands in rural America. As a Midwestern White racial realist, I would gladly settle amongst my racial brethren in Southern Appalachia, for example, as long as they are fellow racial realists. The fresh air, open space, and freedom from taxes that feed the Negroid welfare trampoline are highly enticing. Our Southern Brethren tried to warn us about Negroes a long time ago, but too many Northerners had been brainwashed that Southerners were slow witted by the same greed driven, imperialistic wealthy capitalists that were inviting Negroes North as a cheap labor source with no regard for the havoc they would inflict, and are now inviting unabated hordes of Mestizoes into our land for the same reason. We racial realists need to form our Pan-European Zions wherever we can, but we might as well do this with little or no violence when possible. As such, we might as well build our Zions in fertile ground. I think we should follow the Mormon example, and not the Israeli example. Might as well form our communities where they are already started, places like Southern Appalachia and the Rocky Mountains. Kalispell, Montana is building a right impressive community, as I understand, and there is no reason we can&rsquo;t build communities in all kinds of locations, such as Southern Appalachia and The Ozark Mountains of Missouri/Arkansas. I personally prefer, from a Midwestern standpoint, building communities in Southern Appalachia and the Ozarks, where folks are already racial realists. Us Northern folks can help solidify European American Zions in those areas as the White Liberals sit idly by and allow the Blacks and other non-Whites to take over in the Great Lakes States.</p>

They would learn that Blacks have never had a harder life than us in America. As Slaves, they had a far easier life, by and large, than the immigrant factory worker in the North. Provided they worked hard, the Black slave never worried about being homeless, or having enough to eat. They didn&rsquo;t have to manage money, or secure a home for their family. This was all done for them. This is why, around 1900, when former Black slaves were interviewed, about 70% of them had nothing but good to say about their former masters.<br/>
Considering the Negro temperament, I think this is amazing testimony to the benevolence with which, obviously, the large majority of Black slaves were treated by their masters. Blacks, as we know, are hardly ever happy, and expect a lot of pampering before they will speak with such benevolence. They certainly don&rsquo;t have such feelings towards Northerners these days, despite the coddling they have received here. I could recommend some excellent reading to these Liberals that would, should sensibility prevail, reshape their views.</p>

<p>Apartheid was ended by allowing half-a-million Litvaks to move into South Africa and vote. Joe Slovo created the slogans &#8220;Kill the white farmer!&#8221; as he organized a Marxist revolution. After stealing the wealth and the land from the Boers who built it, over 90% of the Litvaks fled South Africa for other countries like Great Britain, Canada, and America.</p>
<p>Now guess which countries are having mass non-white immigration?</p>
<p>Go ahead. I&rsquo;ll wait forever.</p>

Their ideations stem from a fantasyland inside of their heads, where we Whites are actually bullying Blacks to the point where they snap, and become the psychopathic idiots that they are. To any of us who have had to spend any amount of time around Blacks, and who are realists about life, this is the ultimate flight of fantasy. These Libtards are imagining a scenario that has never occurred. Black behavior is mostly a result of genetics. Blacks are rarely bullied by non-Negroes. Blacks constantly bully everyone else, though, and in the old days, folks did not sit back and allow themselves to be bullied by Negroes. Negroes cannot be reasoned with. Constant and unnecessary conflict is in their nature. To expect a Negro to become culturally European is an exercise in futility. Their nature is to want to fight constantly. When these Libtards say things like &#8220;Coexist&#8221;, they are apparently unaware that most Negroes laugh at such a notion. Negroes enjoy conflict, and enjoy watching others suffer, including other Negroes. When a man falls on the ice, for example, the typical Negro reaction is laughter. Our reaction of wondering if the person is hurt, and empathizing with their pain, is simply not present in the average Negro. Negroes are an inferior race, and always will be. The late, great George Wallace had the right idea: segregation now, segregation forever!!! Negroes will always be an inferior race with an inferior temperament.</p>
