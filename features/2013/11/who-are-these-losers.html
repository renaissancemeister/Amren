The origins of Anti-Racist Action.</div> 
</div> 


<p>Many readers of <i>American Renaissance</i> are aware of &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; activist networks, but very little has been written about them. These networks are the most militant proponents of political correctness and are ideologically very much with the grain of mainstream social trends. They have many chapters throughout the country. And yet they are notoriously shady and obscure &mdash; most members of the public are unaware of them. Indeed, they operate in near secrecy, and their members often wear masks at public events. Worse still, they are violent; they proclaim this proudly in their literature. In this article I would like to examine what is probably the best-known of these networks in the United States: Anti-Racist Action.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Background</b></p>
<p>The anti-racist movement in the United States has antecedents in Britain, and was first organized by the Socialist Workers&rsquo; Party (SWP), which in turn traces its intellectual roots all the way back to the Trotsky&rsquo;s Fourth International of 1938. The SWP&rsquo;s anti-racist activity was in response to the success in Britain of the National Front.</p>
<p>With up to 14,000 members, John Tyndall and Martin Webster&rsquo;s National Front was at the height of its success in the mid-1970s, performing well &mdash; for a nationalist party &mdash; in local and parliamentary by-elections. Though the NF won no seats, in the Greater London Council election of 1977, for example, it got nearly 120,000 votes, and polled better than the Liberals in 33 of 92 constituencies.</p>
<p>The SWP&rsquo;s original anti-fa group was the Anti-Nazi League (ANL, though some prefer ANaL), organized in 1977. ANL had sponsors who were either prominent or went on to prominence. One was the anti-Apartheid campaigner and former Youth Liberals president Peter Hain, who later joined the Labour Party and remains a prominent supporter of Unite Against Fascism. Until he was forced to resign for failing to declare campaign donations, Mr. Hain held cabinet positions under Gordon Brown&rsquo;s and Tony Blair&rsquo;s Labour administrations, and was Leader of the House of Commons during half of Mr. Blair&rsquo;s second term.</p>
<div id="attachment_106561" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ANL.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106561" alt="Anti-Nazi League protest" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ANL.jpg" width="550" height="369"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Anti-Nazi League protest.</p></div>
<p>Another Anti-Nazi League sponsor was Neil Kinnock, who was later Labour Party leader, member of the European Parliament, and Vice-President of the European Commission. He now sits in the House of Lords, having accepted a peerage despite previously refusing (allegedly out of principle) even to set foot in the upper chamber. The ANL also enjoyed the support of many trade unions.</p>
<p>The ANL was linked to the Rock Against Racism campaign, started in 1976 by <i>Sunday Times</i> photographer Red Saunders, after Eric Clapton declared support for Enoch Powell and shouted the NF slogan &mdash; &ldquo;Keep Britain White&rdquo; &mdash; at a concert in Birmingham. Another impetus to Rock Against Racism was David Bowie&rsquo;s &ldquo;racist&rdquo; and &ldquo;pro-Nazi&rdquo; declarations (&ldquo;Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars&rdquo;) in 1976. Mr. Bowie later blamed these comments on drug use and an obsession with occultism and Nietzsche.</p>
<p>Rock Against Racism enjoyed support from pop, rock, and reggae, but it overlapped with the punk movement to a significant degree, and its &ldquo;Carnival Against the Nazis,&rdquo; organized jointly with the ANL in 1978, included groups such as The Clash, Buzzcocks, Sham 69, X-Ray Spex, and Generation X. Other punk groups supported later festivals.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RAR.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106562" alt="RAR" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RAR.jpg" width="550" height="359"/></a></p>
<p>The Anti-Nazi League targeted the National Front and Colin Jordan&rsquo;s British Movement, though the league was primarily anti-police, and became known for its violent street-fighting gangs, referred to as &ldquo;squads.&rdquo; These were formed first in Manchester and then elsewhere, with the aim of assaulting National Front members &mdash; and the police, whom they saw as instruments of fascism &mdash; on every possible occasion. (Manchester remains the capital of militant anti-fascism.) This was not the only tactic used by ANL squadists: One of them, Steven Tizley, was imprisoned for kidnapping a young skinhead in his efforts to discover the address a family of NF activists then living in Lancashire.</p>
<p>Yet it was not the Anti-Nazi League that eventually stopped the National Front, but Margaret Thatcher, who by 1979 had moved the Conservative Party to the Right, offering a &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; alternative after five years of miserable Labour governments. Many former Conservatives, who had defected to the NF, rejoined the Conservative Party, and the NF, afflicted by internal problems, went into sharp decline. By 1981, the ANL had thoroughly discredited itself because of its violent squadism, and was finally disbanded by the Socialist Workers&rsquo; Party, which expelled ANL members from the party.</p>
<p>This was not the end of anti-fa terrorism, however. Former ANL members quickly formed an equally violent working-class group, Red Action, grouped around a newspaper of the same name that was sold in Left-wing bookshops. Red Action was mostly Irish, pro-IRA, and anti-police. One of Red Action&rsquo;s leading members, Patrick Hayes, who was English, was involved in street fights against NF members from the beginning, and would later run an IRA bombing campaign. When he was finally arrested in 1993, the police found Semtex, handguns, ammunition, and electronic detonators in his basement flat, plus keys to a north-London garage filled with home-made explosives.</p>
<p>Red Action provided leaders for Anti-Fascist Action (AFA), a group formed in 1985. Violence was at the center of the AFA&rsquo;s strategy and it even criticized the ANL for not having been confrontational enough with the National Front and for having cooperated with &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;conservative&rdquo;) groups linked to the state. These included the Labour Party and even such &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; but non-violent publications as <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_magazine">Searchlight</a></i>.</p>
<p>In 1988, Red Action developed a musical arm called Cable Street Beat, which organized concerts and published an occasional magazine. The bands had a strong DIY (&ldquo;do it yourself,&rdquo; meaning independently produced and marketed)/punk flavour and included The Men They Couldn&rsquo;t Hang (folk punk), The Neurotics (punk rock/post-punk), Attila the Stockbroker (folk punk), The Blaggers (Oi!/punk rock), Angelic Upstarts (Oi!/punk rock).</p>

<p align="center"><b>Origins of Anti-Racist Action</b></p>
<p>Anti-Racist Action was founded in 1988 by a Minneapolis-based group of Left-wing skinheads, who had adopted the name &ldquo;Baldies&rdquo; in 1986. According to Minnesota journalist Matt Snyders:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Baldies began as a small, insular group of friends hanging out, drawn together by a shared love of oi! music &mdash; working-class punk rock with unpretentious, street level lyrics. Many were straight-edge &mdash; no drugs or drink &mdash; and all harbored a disdain for racists, particularly neo-Nazis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their main target was the White Knights, a Klan group, whom they would attack (give a &ldquo;boot party&rdquo;) on sight.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Newspaper.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106565" alt="Newspaper" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Newspaper.jpg" width="500" height="328"/></a></p>
<p>By 1987 they tried to widen their influence and introduce a more explicitly political approach to their brand of anti-racism. They approached student groups, including the University of Minnesota Black Law Student Association, of which now-Congressman Keith Ellison was then an officer. The name Anti-Racist Action was a variant on Anti-Fascist Action, the British group founded two years earlier. ARA copied the &ldquo;no platform&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, no debate with opponents) policy of the AFA. Mr. Snyders continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>That summer, two carloads of Baldies followed Blind Approach on their tour to New York City. For two weeks, the crew acted as the Johnny Appleseeds of the ARA, planting the seeds of what would become a national movement. They cruised the streets of Chicago; Milwaukee; Allentown, Pennsylvania; and Rochester, New York, shouting the international skinhead greeting to any Doc Martens-wearing, close-cropped chap they passed: &ldquo;Oi!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many of the groups they came across were scattered, unorganized, and nameless. Upon learning about the activities of Anti-Racist Action, some simply decided to adopt the name &ldquo;ARA&rdquo; and operate as a chapter. ARA affiliates sprang up in Los Angeles, San Diego, Portland, Vancouver, and Front Range, Colorado. The first gathering of the national network was held in Portland, Oregon, in 1988.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Ideological roots</b></p>
<p>As with their antecedents in Britain, ARA&rsquo;s ideology mixes anarchism and Trotskyism. The Love and Rage Anarchist Federation, a revolutionary organization, played a key role building the ARA network during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Love and Rage was launched at a conference in 1989. Its predecessors were the Minnesota-based Revolutionary Anarchist Bowling League (RABL), and a faction of the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL), an orthodox Trotskyist group, from which Love and Rage obtained the Aspect Foundation, its tax-exempt, non-profit organization.</p>
<p>The RABL had been founded by members of the Back Room Anarchist Books collective who wanted more militant, explicitly revolutionary anarchist politics. The group gained notoriety during a protest of Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s invasion of Nicaragua in 1988, when someone who was probably a member of the Revolutionary Anarchist Bowling League threw a bowling ball through the window of a military recruiting center. Some of the Baldies/ARA were involved with RABL, and it is probably through this group that anarchist politics became integral to the ARA program.</p>
<p>Love and Rage members had scant regard for anarchist orthodoxies, and from the beginning were influenced by several varieties of Marxism, most notably support for national liberation struggles and the embrace of a white-privilege analysis of racism in the US. They claimed that white workers received material and psychological benefits at the expense of non-white &mdash; especially black &mdash; workers, and since white privilege undermined multi-racial working class unity, it had to be confronted directly.</p>
<p>These ideas were reinforced by prison-solidarity work, which forged personal relationships between Love and Rage members and former members of groups such as the Black Panther Party, the Black Liberation Army, the Weather Underground Organization, and the George Jackson Brigade.</p>
<p>Noel Ignatiev, now a history professor at the Massachusetts College of Art, was one of the writers who was influential in linking black nationalism and American Communism. In the late 1950s, Prof. Ignatiev had been a member of the Provisional Organizing Committee, a proto-Maoist breakaway from the Communist Party USA. Prof. Ignatiev then became active in the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and played a leading role in the Sojourner Truth Organisation, which blended Maoism and Italian Autonomist Marxism. Prof. Ignatiev briefly joined Love and Rage when it was founded, and is now probably best known for his book, <i><a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2012/12/how-the-irish-became-white-part-1/">How the Irish Became White</a>. </i>He also edited a journal, <i><a href="http://racetraitor.org/">Race Traitor</a></i>, which was notorious for its motto, &ldquo;treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity,&rdquo; and for its calls to &ldquo;abolish&rdquo; the white race. He is frequently cited as an authority by ARA activists.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RaceTraitor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106570" alt="RaceTraitor" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RaceTraitor.jpg" width="316" height="401"/></a></p>
<p>One of the most important contributions to the ARA mindset may have been the ideology of the Weather Underground Organisation. Indeed, it is similar to the ARA: clandestine, militant, confrontational, violent, conspiratorial, and attracts young, mostly white members with its egalitarian-universalist moral idealism. Originating from the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM) faction of the SDS, members of the Weather Underground were dissatisfied with the previous strategy of non-violent resistance and opted for domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>The Weathermen issued a declaration of war against the United States, and from 1969 until the mid-1970s, conducted a violent anti-government campaign, included bombings and arson, targeting, in particular, the police and the FBI. The Weathermen hoped that urban guerrilla warfare would catalyze a revolutionary uprising that would support a Marxist-Leninist Party in the United States, overthrow the government, and support national liberation movements in the Third World. The Weathermen had contacts with the governments of Cuba and North Vietnam, but also with the Chinese government, then three years into the Cultural Revolution. (Up to 20 million people were killed in the violence of the Cultural Revolution, <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e-kVgozyE8gC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=100+million+persecution+cultural+revolution&amp;cd=7&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">according to Daniel Chirot</a>.) The FBI soon put the Weathermen on its ten-most-wanted list.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WeatherUnderground.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106566" alt="WeatherUnderground" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WeatherUnderground.jpg" width="550" height="413"/></a></p>
<p>Citing Lenin in <i>Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism</i> (1916), the Weathermen thought that &ldquo;the main struggle going on in the world today is between US imperialism and the national liberation struggles against it.&rdquo; Like Marx, the group claimed that oppressed people were the rightful owners of the wealth of empire, because they created it. The Weathermen saw their goal as &ldquo;the destruction of US imperialism and the achievement of a classless world: world communism.&rdquo; Their 1969 founding document, <i>You Don&rsquo;t Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows</i>, takes its title from a verse of a song by Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>Most importantly for our purposes, the Weathermen were vociferous advocates of the theory of &ldquo;white privilege,&rdquo; against which they supported non-white identity politics. Bernardine Dohrn, a leading theorist of the terrorist group (and now, ironically &mdash; without ever having served a prison sentence, due to a judge&rsquo;s error &mdash; an associate professor of law at the Northwestern University School of Law), stated, &ldquo;White youth must choose sides <i>now</i>. They must either fight on the side of the oppressed, or be on the side of the oppressor.&rdquo; This has since become textbook ARA language.</p>
<p>Historians sympathetic to these groups conceive them as part of a tradition of American anti-racist white organising that goes back to the 19th century, beginning with the radical wing of the abolitionist movement, which sought both an end to slavery and racial equality. These efforts continued with the white anarchists and socialists of the labour movement, including the Industrial Workers of the World and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. This led into the 1960s and the Civil Rights Movement. For Chris Crass, author of <i>Towards Collective Liberation: Anti-Racist Organizing, Feminist Praxis, and Movement Building Strategy</i>, ARA was part of a continuation of this tradition into the 1990s that also included Earth First!, Food Not Bombs, Anarchist Black Cross, Books to Prisoners, Homes Not Jails, Lesbian Avengers, Anarchist Youth Federation, and Art and Revolution.</p>

<p>The Anti-Racist Action network&rsquo;s national structure was finally formalized in 1994 at the Midwest Anti-Fascist Network meeting in Columbus, Ohio. The network is decentralized, with chapters spread throughout the United States. It has a logo, but no central office &mdash; although it has released a compilation CD giving an address in California, which may simply be a chapter. It does have four points of unity, upon which every chapter must agree:</p>
<ol>
<li>We go where they go. Whenever fascists are organizing or active in public, we&rsquo;re there. We don&rsquo;t believe in ignoring them or staying away from them. Never let the Nazis have the street!</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t rely on the cops or courts to do our work for us. This doesn&rsquo;t mean we never go to court, but the cops uphold white supremacy and the status quo. They attack us and everyone who resists oppression. We must rely on ourselves to protect ourselves and stop the fascists.</li>
<li>Non-sectarian defense of other anti-fascists. In ARA, we have a lot of different groups and individuals. We don&rsquo;t agree about everything and we have a right to differ openly. But in this movement an attack on one is an attack on us all. We stand behind each other.</li>
<li>We support abortion rights and reproductive freedom. ARA intends to do the hard work necessary to build a broad, strong movement against racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, discrimination against the disabled, the oldest, the youngest, and the most oppressed people. We want a classless, free society. We intend to win!</li>
</ol>
<p>The main ARA website now lists only a few chapters in the United States and Canada: Los Angeles, Arch City (Columbus), Calgary, Central Florida, Central Texas, Lafayette (Indiana), Circle City (Indiana), Rose City (Portland), South Side Chicago, and Minneapolis.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Image</b></p>
<p>I have already noted that the &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; movement has links to the punk subculture, and that ARA is proud of its ethos of violence. This is evident in all its propaganda, which is crude, hastily thrown together, and designed for maximum visual aggression. White, black, and red are the dominant colors; faces in masks, hoodies, and balaclavas are common. The archetypal &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; activist is always depicted as angry, in aggressive postures, about to commit or committing an assault against an unseen victim, who is sometimes the viewer. Indeed, the main theme is intimidation and bodily assault. The most common weapons depicted are fists, slings, and baseball bats.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sling.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106557" alt="Sling" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sling.jpg" width="500" height="405"/></a></p>
<p>ARA literature delights in displaying smashed swastikas and bleeding skinheads and neo-Nazis, surrounded by blocky, screaming slogans, and humorous, triumphalist copy. In style and content, their prose suggests little reading or education; any knowledge they have was most likely acquired second-hand from their comrades, and in their minds it is reduced to slogans. In look and feel it is like the do-it-yourself ethos of the 1970s punk scene, only updated with personal computers and simple publishing software.</p>
<p>Compared to the bravado of their graphics, ARA activists are unimpressive: scrawny, unkempt, wearing informal, worn-out clothes from charity shops. Far from the image they cultivate of tough street warriors clad in black and wearing Doc Marten&rsquo;s boots, they wear soft cotton clothing and comfortable shoes. There is no evidence of involvement in sports. The women, who are always a minority, are consistently unglamorous.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/NPILeaflet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106559" alt="NPILeaflet" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/NPILeaflet.jpg" width="352" height="536"/></a></p>
<p align="center"><b>Psychology</b></p>
<p>Despite the romanticized conception given to them by people like Mr. Crass, it seems that the main appeal of ARA is that it lets activists engage in anti-social acts of violence and vandalism against private people and property under the cloak of moral idealism. It seems improbable that a person with high self-esteem, talent, and good prospects in life would choose ARA activism as a lifestyle or as the most meaningful way to improve the world. These young activists seem to have concluded early that their prospects in life were minimal, and that ARA terror was the only way to give their lives meaning. They find significance in lashing out.</p>
<p>Their choice of targets is instructive. In their war against privilege and racial supremacy, they target the most marginalized, disprivileged, and powerless: Klansmen and Neo-Nazis. This suggests cowardice because they are dishonest about their simple desire for cathartic violence, and because they choose unpopular, ridiculous, weird, or powerless targets from the far reaches of society. Their choice of enemies also shows a lack of ambition. They keep their sights low by targeting people who are, in essence, just like them, only at the opposite extreme of their race-based worldview.</p>
<p>This worldview is so intensely polarized, exaggerated, and stripped of nuance that they end up &mdash; comically &mdash; applying incongruous labels to middle-class proponents of Euro-American identity politics. Indeed, they are baffled when confronted with ideas or people who defy their system of classification. American Renaissance, the National Policy Institute, and Arktos Media, whose editor John Morgan lived for many years in India, are perplexing to them. For the ARA, these must necessarily be Nazis and Klansmen who have disguised themselves in suits and ties in order to deceive a credulous public; indeed, an ARA activist recently complained on Internet radio that Richard Spencer was intelligent.</p>

<p>Ultimately, ARA activism represents a psychopathological mindset, a form of militant masochism. In it we have a group of near- or self-disenfranchised white youths assaulting whites who campaign &mdash; in a variety of guises &mdash; for what is essentially in their interest. The pathological nature of this mindset is obscured by the fact that many of the groups they target are unserious, unpopular, and considered immoral. In a society in which egalitarianism was considered immoral, ARA activism would be incomprehensible, comical, and would deserve clinical study.</p>

<p>When the Tinley Park Five violence happened, I saw mugs of the suspects. At first, I thought the far left Marxist anarchist suspects were the &#8220;right wing extremists&#8221; that were the targets of their violence. From then on, I came to the conclusion, that Alex Kurtagic has, that the other side&rsquo;s wacko extremists and our side&rsquo;s wacko extremists are basically the same kind of people, only a matter of those metaphorical millimeters in their lives&rsquo; narratives and circumstances was the determinant between far left and far right.</p>

I am not aware of any nation state currently where anyone is in any danger of being forced to live under a fundamentalist Christian government.</p>
<p>It does strike me that the type of people found in the ARA camp are very similar to the group of mostly young men who followed John Brown in 1859 on his failed raid to seize the federal armory at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry in Virginia. His purpose was to spark a rebellion by arming the slaves and leading them in the slaughter of their white masters. He utterly failed in this action but his actions proved to the South that the abolitionist were a real danger and that their fanatical element could and would promote a race war to destroy white Southern civilization. </p>
<p>Small groups of radicals have been able to leverage the fears and hatreds of the masses to start a snowballing of events. John Brown could be a prototype of the modern anti-racist left. We also have examples from the right like the Serbian Black Hand that assassinated Arch-duke Ferdinand and sparked the disastrous First World War. Radicals set fire to things but it is the normal, average people just trying to get on with their lives that suffer the most. The problem that we have in the United States is that left wing radicals are in firm control of the government and they are starting fires all over the place.</p>

<p>Laugh at them.<br/>
Interrupt them.<br/>
Throw rotten eggs at them.</p>
<p>Humiliation against Antifa whites shuts them down quickly. I find this works well on the internet too. When I see an anti-White commenting I&rsquo;ll try and find their personal info so I can read into it. Find out who they think they are then tear them down. The thing is they&rsquo;re indoctrinated to constantly be on the attack. When you understand this your goal should be to NEVER answer them. Ever. Never address anything they say. That triggers the next step in their indoctrination.</p>
<p>The key is to keep attacking and their frail ego will snap. Also, I never lead with saying they&rsquo;re anti-White. They&rsquo;re really stupid and wouldn&rsquo;t understand it. You need to break them down first. Once they&rsquo;re demoralized then they&rsquo;re a bit more open to being labeled as an anti-White.</p>

<p>Most Leftists are indoctrinated Cultural Marxists. This means they are:<br/>
anti-White<br/>
anti-Western<br/>
anti-Christian<br/>
anti-Heterosexual<br/>
self-righteous pseudo scientists<br/>
quasi-evolutionists</p>
<p>Since all of the above tend to be true we can see some obvious contradictions. For starters, homosexuals suffer from a mental delusion so great it removes them from the gene pool, making them an evolutionary dead end. Meanwhile, Christian whites tend to have LOTS of children, low crime, and have no problems creating a stable society. The science on homosexuals is an outright lie. Any behavior that results in a rectal prolapse is neither healthy nor is it normal. I typically beat them over the head with this. An example would be:</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t you be getting your rectal prolapse taken care of?</p>
<p>When they try to moralize with their cries of &#8220;homophobia&#8221; then I&rsquo;ll turn up the heat:</p>
<p>Of course you don&rsquo;t understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say. You&rsquo;re butt-fcking stupid.</p>
<p>My goal is not to convert them. My goal is to disarm them and demoralize them. Once they lose their self-assurance and discover they&rsquo;re not facing cowards or that the talking points they&rsquo;re blathering are a complete contradiction then Demoralization sets in. We have to take this in stages. The first stage is Demoralization.</p>

<p>Jared actually reminds me of a modern, white Catholic Priest. He&rsquo;s pie-in-the-sky nice about a brutal, harsh reality that wants him dead. He talks about Salvation and the evils all around us yet doesn&rsquo;t arm himself to fight evil. More importantly, he avoids anyone who does so and even talks down to them.</p>
<p>I live in Sacramento CA right now. No one talks about the huge Slavic and Russian population in Sacramento. No one knows about it. I have friends who don&rsquo;t know anything about these people. They&rsquo;re actually doing now what we should be doing. They don&rsquo;t want to be around white Americans because they see us as lazy, wasteful and for the most part miscegenated. They&rsquo;re right. The Ukrainians and Russians live their culture, language, and religion. You don&rsquo;t hear about the blacks and Mexicans attacking Russians. Why? They don&rsquo;t call the police. They take bats to them and leave them. Let the black criminals call the police.</p>
<p>Whites need to understand some simple rules:<br/>
#1 - The police work for our enemies. Call the police and you&rsquo;re informing the enemy.<br/>
#2 - We are a people under constant attack and subversion.<br/>
#3 - We guard against all of these through exclusion.</p>

<p>My advice to call the police is not so much a matter of trust - though I&rsquo;d trust the Halifax police more than&hellip;many US police departments&hellip;</p>
<p>But my concern is documentation. We still have a legal system and it must be used. Film and document, utilize our right to public services such as POLICE enforcing the law to protect us when we are threatened. We can form a Phalanx, a basically defensive formation upon which enemies throw themselves and &#8220;die&#8221; in droves, so to speak. Speaking on multiple levels here, of course&hellip;</p>
<p>Thank god for the Swampbillies. My theory is that the Slavs hid out for millenia in the Pripyet marshes to emerge in the vacuum left by the Huns, hence &#8220;swampbillies&#8221;. I understand the Russian mob has pretty much eclipsed the old Italian mob in terms of White organised crime. Interesting. </p>
<p>They think we&rsquo;re all mixed with non-Whites? HA HA! They&rsquo;re more or less right, of course. I&rsquo;m between 1/128 and 1/512 arguably non-White (NE Amerind and Sephardic Jewess), and I&rsquo;m pretty White and far more aware of my geneology than even most White Southerners. But if they wanna get too snooty I might point out a few centuries of Tatar toadying and you-know-whating and a few other things as well. Not that I&rsquo;d point it out to a Russkie Don, (or Don Cossack) HA HA!</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-376912" class="dsq-comment-message"><p><i>&hellip;it seems that the main appeal of ARA is that it lets activists engage in anti-social acts of violence and vandalism against private people and property under the cloak of moral idealism.</i></p>
<p>I more or less agree with this and I&rsquo;ve made similar points in the past myself. The way I would put it is that antifa are nothing more than an outlet for the most militant males in the white left to have a safe, physical outlet for aggression that has the moral blessing of the dominant culture. </p>
<p>Sure, if an antifa gets caught assaulting someone, they go to jail just like anyone else, but the difference is that antifa doesn&rsquo;t have its organizations monitored by groups like the $PLC and the ADL, nor does it have the whole weight of the media bearing down on it at all times (just look at the constant scrutiny that white advocates get from online liberal media like Salon, HuffPost, etc.).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing daring, controversial, revolutionary about adopting the hardcore antifa pose. And that&rsquo;s exactly what it is - a pose. As Kurtagic points out, many of these so-called revolutionaries will grow up and become establishment stalwarts. There will be no &#8220;glorious&#8221; revolutions thanks to this lot, and perhaps we should be thankful that they&rsquo;re essentially too lazy and comfortable to fully re-enact the killing fields of their heroes.</p>
<p>In this sense, antifa aren&rsquo;t opponents of the system - they are more like rent-a-cops, or more precisely, unpaid interns. They think they&rsquo;re out on the far reaches of leftist ideology, when in reality they are just the unpaid thugs meant to enforce this system&rsquo;s race replacing, anti-white working class ideology on the street level.</p>
<p>This leads me to my last point which is that I suggest as much as possible we stop using antifa to describe them. For one thing, as a white man with with white racial awareness and strong pro white ideas and sentiments, I am not a fascist. And yet these &#8220;antifa&#8221; would hate me as much as any nazi skinhead. </p>
<p>They specifically use the term &#8220;anti-fascist&#8221; to demonize white people with pro-white racial awareness, because fascism is considered to be a negative, discredited, defeated ideology associated with totalitarian Nazi Germany and fascist Italy.</p>
<p>Many of us contemporary pro-white folk are not fascists, we&rsquo;re not totalitarians, we&rsquo;re not authoritarians, and so we reject their labeling us. There is no necessary link between racial awareness and authoritarian forms of governments. The fact that they continue to label us when all we are are pro-white <i> gets to the heart of what they are - which is anti-white.</i></p>
<p>Antifa aren&rsquo;t antifascist - they&rsquo;re anti-white. This is what they are, and this is what we should call them.</p>

<p>antifa are anti-white, kings of the Reductio ad Hitlerum fallacy (playing the Nazi card) – comparing an opponent or their argument to Hitler or Nazism in an attempt to associate a position with one that is universally reviled. (See also – Godwin&rsquo;s law)</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-377716" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Great post! Wow! This is the kind of stuff that brings me back to Amren. I have to point out there is one small point I&rsquo;d like to disagree on:</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be no &#8220;glorious&#8221; revolutions thanks to this lot, and perhaps we should be thankful that they&rsquo;re essentially too lazy and comfortable to fully re-enact the killing fields of their heroes.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not exactly true. These anti-Whites will not do the killing directly this time. What they&rsquo;re doing is creating the conditions through mass immigration, anti-white propaganda, and anti-white laws to make the mass execution inevitable. These Antifa idiots are hoping to be the Proletariat. They want to be the Hostile Elite, not just the henchmen.</p>
<p>When it comes to accurately categorizing Antifa you&rsquo;re correct - they are anti-White. This is their raison d&rsquo;être. I want to take this further because it&rsquo;s needed so we will know precisely what we&rsquo;re up against. They call us Racists for the same reason they call us Fascists because they&rsquo;re anti-White. If Fascism is &#8220;evil&#8221; then all Whites are &#8220;Fascist&#8221; when they&rsquo;re not also anti-White. They hate Western Civilization because it was created by Whites. They&rsquo;re not anti-religion because they don&rsquo;t hate Muslims or black Christians. Why would they oppose Rev. Jeremiah Wright? He believes what they believe. They&rsquo;re both anti-White. If a black preacher makes a public statement that he needs to &#8220;Look out for the Black Community&#8221; or he&rsquo;s &#8220;Concerned for the welfare of the Black Community&#8221; they will say nothing because they&rsquo;re not anti-religion, they&rsquo;re anti-White. If a White preacher says anything that isn&rsquo;t anti-White the Antifa will attack. They never attack Jim Wallis or his anti-White &#8220;Sojourners&#8221; telling us that it&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to be a White Christian, just so long as you&rsquo;re anti-White.</p>

<p>- Alex Kurtagic, American Renaissance, November 8, 2013</p>
<p>This is true of all extremist movements. Eric Hoffer wrote a book about the phenomenon entitled, &#8220;The True Believer.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is what he wrote, &#8220;The less justified a man is in claiming excellence for his own self, the more ready he is to claim all excellence for his nation, his religion, his race or his holy cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>I doubt it. Trotsky led the crushing of the Kronstadt Uprising. The forced collectivization of the peasants was his idea. </p>
<p>Trotsky was the military leader of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. He turned out to be a military genius, despite no formal military training. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, he took the theories of Marx more seriously than Stalin did. I think that if he had been in charge of the Soviet Union during World War II he would have kept expecting the German working class to revolt against the Nazi government.</p>

The neomarxist argument is the capitalists seek to divide the working class by racism, and that demands for immigration restriction are mere scapegoating and simply creating false fears for political gain. The latter argument was used by a Conservative government defense minister (!) against UKIP&rsquo;s Farage on BBC Question Time last night; it took a European immigrant who had learned English alone to raise the issue of protecting &#8220;British IDENTITY&#8221; above the &#8220;economic&#8221; arguments.

I stated a point of fact that is undeniable. I am not interested in discussing my personal political philosophy with you because that is not the issue on the table. You made a silly and unsupportable claim that &#8220;Forward&#8221; wasn&rsquo;t a communist slogan. Don&rsquo;t try to muddy the water by expanding the conversation to God, the Universe and everything in it. Either provide your proof that &#8220;Forward&#8221; is not a communist slogan as Dogbone stated or admit that you are wrong.</p>

You contend that a slogan using a single two-syllable word is somehow forever tied to Communism. I say that I can use the word in whatever way I choose. I&rsquo;m not your family, your friend, your coworker, or anything else that would have me shape my views to fit your little myopic view of the world.</p>
<p>Deaf mute. Trust me, just go with that, because it makes you look a tad moronic when you pretend to talk so methodically about slogans and labels, but somehow find it too much of a divergence to talk about personal political philosophy as it relates to your own self-anointed title and political labels.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-377405" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Again I was only addressing your denial of Dogbone&rsquo;s statement that &#8220;Forward&#8221; is a communist slogan. You thrash around because you know you are wrong, but instead of acting like a responsible human and conceding the point, which you know you can&rsquo;t defend, you want to try and change the subject. I don&rsquo;t think that you should find yourself forced to see the world in a left-right framework and I didn&rsquo;t suggest that you should. Slogans are just propaganda or advertising, would Arby&rsquo;s roll out a new sandwich using McDonald&rsquo;s slogan? &#8220;Try the New Hot Arby&rsquo;s Roast Beef Sandwich, I&rsquo;m loving it!&#8221; I accept that you are neither left nor right but not that you think the word &#8220;Forward&#8221; has no historical and emotional association with the left.</p>
<p>Now on my part after re-reading my first statement will admit that I made an assumption that was incorrect. There is no particular reason to believe that you are or should be conservative, radical traditionalist or historically aware. I looked up and re-read the &#8220;About Us&#8221; section on AMREN&rsquo;s home page and they don&rsquo;t claim any particular political ideology, their stated central focus is race realism. A race realist could be from most any political or philosophical school of thought, Certainly Che Guevera could wave the &#8220;Forward&#8221; banner while carping about useless blacks in Angola.</p>

<p>You really need to read things properly, because you seem to have a comprehension gap. I said &#8220;I consider myself Forward.&#8221; I didn&rsquo;t necessarily say I call myself that, and I most certainly didn&rsquo;t say it was going up as my slogan. How on earth you are relating that to a McDonald&rsquo;s advertisement is beyond me.</p>
<p>Forward is a word. It is a direction. It is a state of mind if you want it to be. It is somewhere well beyond simple Right/Left politics. If you don&rsquo;t like it, then stay away from me. I&rsquo;m not asking for your help, and I guarantee you I don&rsquo;t need marketing advice. I do extremely well.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right about two things and wrong about something else. History has no direction. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t care if whites live in the Middle Ages, just so long as my people are free of so-called minorities and have their identity intact. When I go to the Slavic Church I see whites being explicitly white and not apologizing for it. It&rsquo;s clean, safe, and the neighborhood is policed by our own. It&rsquo;s a pocket of paradise in the black and brown shitstain of Sacramento.</p>
<p>If History is moving in a direction then I want to go BACKWARDS! I want to go back before 1965 when whites didn&rsquo;t apologize for who we are. When whites were concerned about getting into space and not the Diversity of NASA. I want to go back to a time when if a black tried this flash mob bullcrap every white adult would shoot them dead on the spot.</p>

I completely understand the desire for a reality where White people have a backbone and aren&rsquo;t so politically correct; but going backwards doesn&rsquo;t sound any different than my idea of moving forward. The difference here is that physicists understand and agree that Time moves forward. The whole backwards time thing they have neither fully confirmed, nor even begun to understand. You move Forward, whether your hands are on the wheel and fully aware of your actions or dragged behind the curve kicking and screaming. It&rsquo;s Science.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-377785" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>History has no direction. There is no &#8220;forward.&#8221; Typically people talk about material accumulation or technological advancement as a &#8220;progress.&#8221; This ignores biology. All of the Obama phones in America won&rsquo;t turn Detroit into the St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica. Europeans didn&rsquo;t need or want &#8220;The Chosen.&#8221; The Renaissance happened after they were all kicked out, along with the Muslims.</p>
<p>Physicists don&rsquo;t agree that Time &#8220;moves forward&#8221;. Physicists agree that Time moves in relation to the observer(s). Time expands and contracts based on the speed of the observer. More importantly, whether people agree or disagree is irrelevant to science.</p>
<p>Finally, I hate when people use the word &#8220;Science&#8221; like it holds some mystical power. Saying &#8220;it&rsquo;s Science&#8221; tells us nothing. Science always demands an explanation. Why? Because science is both the methodology and the body of knowledge derived from these provable, repeatable methods.</p>
<p>Should I keep going?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a Cultural Marxist. I have no need to lie or hide anything ideological until the anti-Whites make it illegal to think that me and my people have a right to exist without them lording over us. For this reason I don&rsquo;t mince words and speak clearly. And I could give a crap about Science when it comes to saving my people and Western Civilization. I know how we got here. I know the culture and people it takes to do it again. Right now we have neither the culture nor the people. And that&rsquo;s not science, that&rsquo;s just a sober look at history.</p>

You&rsquo;re arguing something just for the sake of arguing something. If you believe history has no direction(almost like you&rsquo;re saying history could just as easily be written about the future and it would be just as factual), and there is no &#8220;forward,&#8221; then there is no BACKWARDS as you said you would like to go. So if I can&rsquo;t go Forward because there is no Forward, then you most certainly can&rsquo;t go BACKWARD.</p>
<p>* Where Does the Time Go? Forward, Physics Shows</p>
<p>* Time&rsquo;s quantum arrow has a preferred direction: BaBar experiment confirms time asymmetry</p>
<p>I understand you don&rsquo;t care about science. Probably because it negates or contradicts some mythical and mystical views you have about life. To be honest, I have no idea what you are trying to argue other than to say you don&rsquo;t want non-Whites around. Why do you make things so complicated talking about biology if that&rsquo;s all you are essentially saying? What in the world does biology have to do with Time flow or Forward vs Backward?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care about science because science is saying that Diversity is a necessary good.

Science right now is saying that we NEED to give all of our money to foreigners and resident &#8220;minorities&#8221; so they can become scientists, while our own people work to pay for it.</p>

<p>Religious leaders, however, represent some of the most malleable forms of &#8220;diversity&#8221; rhetoric-spewing imbeciles on the planet. We&rsquo;re all God&rsquo;s creation, right? Religious leaders go from decrying homosexuals to actively persuading them to join their congregations. They go from passing themselves off as patriotic and All American to gladly welcoming diversity in their congregations and even being at the forefront of pushing for rights for the illegals. Seriously, Tommy, if it&rsquo;s such an easy task for you to lump the whole of Science into some fish-in-a-barrel generalization, then it&rsquo;s just as easy for me to attack anti-Science using the same method.</p>

<p>He failed to unite the Protestants of Germany in a single organisation, and tried to keep Roman Catholics on side as allies against Bolshevism. Actually he was in key respects a moderniser, with little personal sympathy for the pagan or mythological interests of either Himmler or Rosenberg. He was a Social Darwinist who fitted antisemitism into his worldview, while retaining a lifelong &#8220;admiration&#8221; for Jesus as the &#8220;young man&#8221; from Galilee who rebelled against &#8220;Jewish finance&#8221; in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Objective study of this matter has been skewed by efforts to smear the Catholic Church with Holocaust Guilt.</p>

When people mentally google &#8220;Jew&#8221; and &#8220;Russia&#8221; and &#8220;19th/20th century&#8221; they automatically come up with &#8220;POGROMS&#8221;.

<p>Add in the subsequent antics of the Nazis and it further fits into an ominous foreshadowing framing of history that ironically further distorts its importance and pervasiveness.</p>

<p>Yeah&hellip;for centuries the Jews did the best they could in the West. We know the story. Banned from owning land, participating in the military, they naturally gravitated toward certain professions that produced wealth. They were or became very bright and industrious folk who lent lots of money to non-Jews and no matter how they got shaken down always seemed to eventually end up back on their feet and swimming in the money (at least to non Jewish borrowers and such). </p>
<p>Well, as IQ studies have shown, the European Jews are/were in fact pretty darned bright. Maybe 15 IQ points beyond your average non-Jewish whitey. So&hellip;even though all their success may have been attributable to IQ combined with group loyalty (for which I cannot fault them), they became the convenient scapegoats for all the problems and almost ceased to exist.</p>
<p>Considering our dwindling numbers vis-a-vis others, our relative success, our welfare and affirmative action soaking, not to mention all the horrible lies and hateful propaganda, considering how we are blamed for &#8220;all the problems&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>I say we are the new Jews. Targeted for genocide, hated, reviled, faulted for success and lauded for self destruction. </p>
<p>Karma for Hitler? My dad almost took a bullet to put that rabid dog down. Understand the notion but do not intend to accept it, you know?</p>

In their war against privilege and racial supremacy, they target the most marginalized, disprivileged, and powerless: Klansmen and Neo-Nazis. This suggests cowardice because they are dishonest about their simple desire for cathartic violence, and because they choose unpopular, ridiculous, weird, or powerless targets from the far reaches of society. Their choice of enemies also shows a lack of ambition. They keep their sights low by targeting people who are, in essence, just like them, only at the opposite extreme of their race-based worldview.</p>
<p>- Alex Kurtagic, American Renaissance, November 8, 2013</p>
<p>What I suspect is that most of these &#8220;Klansmen and Neo-Nazis&#8221; (who often hang out on Stormfront) are blue collar workers who are frustrated by their inability to rise economically. Many have been victims of black criminals. </p>
<p>The anti-racist activists are usually college graduates who are angry that their college degrees have not led to middle class careers.</p>
<p>People in both groups are worse off than their parents were at their age. They are frustrated by an economy of diminishing opportunities and rewards.</p>

<p>Alex Kurtagic&rsquo;s article mentions the Socialist Workers&rsquo; Party. I am surprised that organization still exists. When I knew it it was largely composed of men who had failed to pass the Bar Exam, who had flunk out of medical school, who were under employed PhD&rsquo;s in the liberal arts, and so on.</p>
<p>During the War in Vietnam many young men at elite universities joined organizations like Students for a Democratic Society, and the Progressive Labor Party. They were mainly concerned with the War in Vietnam. When the draft ended they moved back to the center, and entered satisfying and lucrative careers. </p>
<p>The person who devotes his life to that sort of thing usually has nothing else going on in his life. </p>

<p>The important issue is to evaluate the real reasons WHY non-observant Jews were disproportionately represented in the leadership of certain revolutionary movements at the beginning of the 20th century, not only among Soviet Bolsheviks and their secret police, but no less significantly in the Hungarian regime of Bela Kun and the CPUSA. </p>
<p>For those mistakenly committed, then and now, to swallowing the &#8220;Protocols&#8221; as a genuine and seamless record of lectures on achieving a world government by Jewry, there is little to be gained from rational argument. For anyone with more open minds I refer them to the explanations summarised by Bertram D. Wolfe, &#8220;Three Who Made a Revolution&#8221; (Penguin ed. 1966) pp.211-214.</p>
<p>See also: Jonathan Frankel (ed) &#8220;Dark Times, Dire Decisions: Jews and Communism&#8221; (Oxford UP 2004) and especially Andre Gerrits, &#8220;The Myth of Jewish Communism&#8221; (Peter Lang, Brussels 2009) which gives the data a more balanced analysis than his title suggests.</p>

<p>While the White Western world was bringing about the Industrial Revolution, where were the majority of Asian societies? Were they more evolved then and decided to not participate? Did they magically digress and devolve on purpose?</p>
<p>While China finally steps into the modern age with their vast resources and large population, they are polluting their rivers and air at levels that haven&rsquo;t been seen since times when those supposedly not-so-evolved Whites first learned about the negative impacts of industrialization. Yeah, John, those not-so-evolved Gentiles had already been there, done that, and learned to &#8220;evolve&#8221; the processes to lessen environmental impact. Ironically, John, some of the most advanced and developed societies always seem to be the White countries. Without throwing Japan into the mix, the Asian populations are very sparse in terms of advancements and technology that isn&rsquo;t &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from some White country.</p>
<p>I think you are a perfect example illustrating why AmRen will never truly inspire any real racial awakening. Your arguments and fetishes are stale, and any White man or woman would need their head examined if they believed you to be truly a Racial Nationalist. You&rsquo;re a Fetish, looking for a Cause.</p>

<p>Precisely why many people are confused as to why you&rsquo;ve been tolerated for so long. A website and entity that floats the idea of race differences being at the core of societal dysfunction, and all but outright stating the belief in some degree of Racial Nationalism, and yet you&rsquo;re allowed to spout your fetish agenda, while others have their comments sanitized and pruned for supposedly being off topic or against rules?</p>
<p>Your affliction is not just consistent, it&rsquo;s well beyond the cusp of delusional obsession. I could see if you were at a Yellow Fever website, where you spend a great amount of time with people like yourself, but you&rsquo;re on a website where 95% of the people commenting believe in some form of Racial Nationalism.</p>
<p>Race Realism is a meaningless concept if not applied to some form of action. What&rsquo;s the point of it? To understand and learn something? What&rsquo;s the point of understanding if not to affect change? I know what I would like to change, and unless AmRen would like to state something specific, I have a good idea of what they would like to change. What exactly is it you&rsquo;re trying to change, John? Our minds on Race as it relates to Nation Building, right?</p>

<p>That is because you do not want to believe it. When documenting the biological superiority of Ashkenazi Jews and Orientals I try to restrict myself to information I have found on this website, but that superiority is not in question. IQ matters. They&rsquo;ve got the IQ power.</p>

(Which, in the case of Orientals, is only slightly higher than it is for whites.) IQ is important but it is hardly the be all and end all. Polyphony was invented in Europe. The great bulk of the music I find worth listening to is of European origin. OTOH, the deepest, most beautiful board game I know of is go, and all the top players are Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. So how do you compare go to Renaissance music? You can&rsquo;t. So absolute claims about superiority are meaningless. What we can safely say is that Europeans and Asians have both proven that they can create, maintain, and advance complex civilizations. Africans have not.</p>

Their physiognomy was fairly similar, though their hair and eye-colors usually differed (there were raven-haired Vikings). The facial statuary of ancient Roman leaders often looks quite &#8220;Germanic&#8221;. Achievements of ancient Nordids (e.g. in agriculture, wheeled-transport, artefacts and religion) should not underrated, any more than the cultural achievements of ancient Mediterranids should be arbitrarily ascribed to Nordid invaders. More on this, with documentation, if requested.</p>

<p>Actually it&rsquo;s very Jewish. Jews see themselves as &#8220;The Other&#8221; and therefore always assume &#8220;The Other&#8221; is a necessary good. When &#8220;The Other&#8221; is not a necessary good, when &#8220;Diversity&#8221; isn&rsquo;t necessary for high achievement and growth of a society then the entire basis for Judaism collapses. It becomes clear that no white society needs a Cartel that functions as a Hostile Elite to thrive. In fact, history proves the opposite is true.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t Jews that translated the Greek Classics. It was white Christians.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t Jews that created the Renaissance. It was white Christians.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t Jews that created America. It was white Christians.</p>
<p>So the argument of the Jew always must be to justify the movement of their people into a society that flourished and thrived without them. So they lie and spread the propaganda that has become so common place today it&rsquo;s part of popular opinion. The lies exist to claim that the people, culture, and religion that accomplished greatness, that created this modern world, didn&rsquo;t actually do it and therefore these &#8220;thieves&#8221; need &#8220;The Other.&#8221; So they&rsquo;ll side with any &#8220;Minority&#8221; because their Cult identifies with &#8220;The Other.&#8221; To them, &#8220;The Other&#8221; is chosen.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t one shred of history to prove those statements above are not true. There is a billion shekels spent every moment to make truth a lie.</p>
<p>Now we hear that &#8220;slaves built America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now we hear that &#8220;the Renaissance was Secular atheism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now we hear that &#8220;Italians are African&#8221; and &#8220;Socrates was Black.&#8221;</p>
<p>We should be at a place where we can say that anti-White, anti-Western Outsiders and their cartel has no place in our world.</p>

<p>What I &#8220;really feel&#8221; about &#8220;Jews&#8221; (and other people) is that I am against some of them, but not others, especially over support for multiracial immigration and radical leftism. I am not anti-Jewish per se - although I understand why many Jews have been drawn to these causes as a postwar reaction to Hitlerism. We all have to understand how &#8220;antisemitism&#8221; has developed over the centuries, but seeking a modus vivendi is more urgent than ever as the &#8220;white and western world&#8221; is under threat, demographically and geostrategically.</p>

Nor is it &#8220;anti-Semitic&#8221; to disagree strongly with influential Jewish organisations that support Muslim and other third-world immigration, and multiculturalism, as indeed some do in the USA, UK and EU, while agreeing with Jews like my old acquaintances Nathaniel Weyl, Alfred Sherman and Harold Soref, in opposing these threats to western life.</p>
<p>Of course, one can be accused of antisemitism today precisely by saying &#8220;Some of my best friends are Jews&#8221;. At primary school one of my best friends was a Jew, while at grammar school I knew an ardent young Jewish communist, who supported Stalin and regurgitated &#8220;Daily Worker&#8221; propaganda, and with whom I had vigorous debates, while getting on perfectly well with him as a person. </p>
<p>I shall criticise Jews and anyone else who are doing or saying things I consider harmful to England or the West, whether they &#8220;like&#8221; it or not.</p>

I usually know something about the authors whatever their &#8220;race, religion, gender, orientation or whatever&#8221;, before I read or buy a book, and judge them on the value of the contents.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose I might have had more junior friends of the &#8220;Mosaic persuasion&#8221;, since the local synagogue was in a nearby road. The close friend was called Raymond Fishman but I also invited Cohen to birthday parties. My other two best friends were John Howe, a dearly loved English boy later killed in a road accident, and Peter Klahn, a German lad brought over from the French Zone so his father could work on our military lenses instead of Der Fuehrer&rsquo;s.<br/>
You see, I am more candid about real names than &#8220;stewball&#8221;.</p>

Secondly, the motivations are explained by Antony Sutton in &#8220;Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution&#8221; (1999) and Charles Levinson in &#8220;Vodka-Cola&#8221; (1978). The co-operative, if over-estimated, role of some Jews in both camps was explained by their shared internationalism unrestrained by an attachment to Christianity.</p>

<p>The intelligence, wealth and influence of Jews are not the crucial issue, and not disputed by MacDonald or me or anyone else who has studied the question in some depth.</p>
<p>The question is whether the interests and activities of many ethnic Jews coincide with those of many non-Jews. Two examples: strong support among Jews for foreign immigration into western societies, and strong support among Jews for policies that Arabs consider detrimental to their own interests. You may be for or against, or have different explanations, but these are examples of conflict; and there have been others down the ages and in different countries.</p>

<p>I have supported individual Jews who oppose third-world mass-immigration (e.g. Alfred Sherman, Melanie Phillips, Harold Soref), respect those who have opposed communism (e.g. David Dallin, Eugene Lyons, Max Beloff), and sympathise with those who have come close to race-realism (e.g. Nathaniel Weyl, John Glad, Paul Gottfried), but there have been too few of them, and others are kept away by &#8220;Romaniac&#8221; ravings; once bitten, twice shy.</p>

Bankers and the international corporations are not generally Communists, they are hyper-Capitalists. The degrees of separation are very small. Hyper Capitalism is why China was so easily transitioned from a Communist government into a seemingly more capitalist government. Communists tend to be so self-absorbed that they believe their own rhetoric. That makes them more vocal and more blunt in their views and rhetoric. The Globalists simply support any rhetoric that breaks down national borders or social order that would deny them access to a global market.</p>

This is not so strange when you realize that liberals and conservatives are two distinct types of people. Conservatives put loyalty above fairness and care, and liberals put fairness and care above loyalty. I recommend &#8220;The Righteous Mind&#8221; by Jonathan Haidt, which explains how political orientation clusters around these two personality types.</p>

In the context of group identity politics, white liberals are more concerned about other groups than their own group. Jonathan Haidt&rsquo;s book does not get into the question of what liberal vs. conservative means in a multi-ethnic society. What appears to happen is that liberals in the dominant group turn against their own group. This is true in the West and also in India.</p>

The Democrats have tended in the post-desegregation era to have much more of a multi-ethnic constituency than till recently &#8220;white Gentile&#8221; Republicans, but this is probably driven largely by their more welfare-statist attitude. The USA has therefore been moving towards a situation like that in the UK where there is an ethnic competition for political allocations of tax-funded state revenues. So the major parties themselves compete for ethnic votes as such, not simply on the basis of neutral or implictly WASP &#8220;values and concerns&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead of an homogeneous society of similar race, single public language and general religious heritage, you have a collection of ethnocentric communities competing for the public purse, plus the import of incompatible foreign loyalties (e.g. Mexican Raza &<br/>
Muslims v Jews and Hindus).</p>

The Ashkenazim, Orientals, and white Gentiles of European origins live and work together harmoniously, except for the resentment of a few white Gentiles of European origin, who think that they deserve more in life than Jews and Orientals with more intelligence. </p>
<p>It is the inferior races that make diversity problematic.</p>

The same kind of people who like to gloat about lower IQ averages for blacks and Hispanics resent being reminded of higher averages for Jews and Orientals. So I remind them.</p>
<p>I would enjoy living in a city where nearly everyone was a white Gentile of European origins, a Jew, or an Oriental, with just enough Hispanics and Ethiopians to operate a few Hispanic and Ethiopian restaurants. I am confident that quite a few white Gentiles of European origins feel the way I do, especially those with more education.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-379732" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Racism is bad and we should be aware that all races need to live on this earth for better or for worse. However, we must allow those races to develop within their own cultures. When one tries to mix the races into a single country in large numbers, tensions will always arise. There are too many differences in the way we live, the religions we follow and the cultural expectations of each race. It is totally impossible at this point in time, to create laws that envelop all of these differences fairly. For this reason, we have unfair laws that always favour the immigrant over the indigenous and the minority over the majority. When one begins to fight back, it is not because of racism, it is the fear of losing one&rsquo;s identity. It matters not which country you come from, you are a member of a race, black, white or pink with purple spots, it matters not. However, your identity and that of your kinsfolk is important to you. Your culture and your religion is equally as important and compromising those for the sake of newcomers to the country is a threat to your cultural individuality. </p>
<p>Africans are removing whites from their country, sometimes violently, they see whites as invaders. Why then is it wrong for us as whites to see them as invaders when they arrive in boatloads in our country? Let&rsquo;s face it, if aliens came in spaceships, the armed forces would be out in huge numbers ready to shoot them out of the sky. Is there really a difference?</p>
<p>There will come a time in the distant future when races can be unified, those cultural or religious differences will be so small and insignificant that they will not interfere. This may or may not come about but it will have to do so gradually and naturally. It is not possible to force it as this leads only to trouble and the enforcement of laws in an attempt to quell that trouble only serves to anger and bring the trouble on much quicker than it otherwise would. </p>
<p>We can still have immigration but not on the scale it has been until now. Small numbers will integrate but large numbers will congregate since everyone naturally prefers the company of their own race. For this reason, large numbers will not integrate as they will be constantly surrounded by their own culture.</p>
