<div class="intro-paragraph">
DOJ report for 2012 is utterly unreliable.</div> 
</div> 


<p>The Department of Justice has just <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2012">released</a> its &ldquo;hate crimes&rdquo; report for 2012. As usual, it is a mix of the inexcusable, the unreliable, and the incomprehensible. To begin with the inexcusable, it still lists Hispanics as a victim category but not as a perpetrator category. Offenders can only be white, black, Indian/Eskimo, or Asian, so despite the fact that Hispanics are the <i>second largest</i> <i>group</i> in the country, as offenders they are lumped in with whites.</p>
<p>The report lists 42 different categories for <i>where</i> hate crimes took place &mdash; 105 at bars or nightclubs, 72 in convenience stores, for example &mdash; but it would have us believe that not one of 53 million Hispanics committed a &ldquo;hate crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is bad enough that the Justice Department treats Hispanics as whites for its reports on index crimes, thereby inflating the &ldquo;white&rdquo; crime rate. To fail to account for Hispanic perpetrators in what is supposed to be a report on discrimination is beyond inexcusable.</p>
<div id="attachment_106856" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Gang.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106856" alt="&quot;White&quot; people" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Gang.jpg" width="550" height="361"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;White&#8221; people.</p></div>
<p>Hispanics are only the largest perpetrator category that is omitted. Homosexuals, the handicapped, Jews, Muslims, etc. are carefully classified as <i>victims</i>,<i> </i>but never as perpetrators.</p>
<p>As we will see, local reporting to the DOJ on &ldquo;hate crimes&rdquo; is so wildly inconsistent that it is not possible to take any of this information seriously, but what does this report claim to tell us?</p>
<p>In all of 2012 there were 6,705 bias &ldquo;offenses&rdquo; which had the following motivations:</p>
<p>Race: 3,297</p>
<p>Sexual orientation: 1,318</p>
<p>Religion: 1,166</p>
<p>Ethnic/national origin: 822</p>
<p>Disability: 102</p>
<p>Types of offense range from serious violence &mdash; there were 10 murders &mdash; to such things as 1,906 cases of property destruction/vandalism. Some of the finer bias motivations &mdash; and the number of incidents &mdash; were as follows:</p>
<p>Anti-black: 2,180</p>
<p>Anti-homosexual: 1,089</p>
<p>Anti-Jewish: 696</p>
<p>Anti-white: 739</p>
<p>Anti-Hispanic: 488</p>
<p>Anti-lesbian: 162</p>
<p>Anti-Islamic: 149</p>
<p>Anti-Asian: 134</p>
<p>Anti-American Indian/Eskimo: 109</p>
<p>Anti-Catholic: 79</p>
<p>Anti-Protestant: 34</p>
<p>Who are the offenders? No fewer than 30 percent are unknown, and most of those cases were anonymous graffiti and property damage. Of the known offenders, 60 percent are said to be &ldquo;white,&rdquo; which includes Hispanics, and 21 percent were black. There is reason to question whether the police look as hard for &ldquo;hate&rdquo; when whites are victims as they do when whites are perpetrators, but blacks are still considerably <i>overrepresented</i> as hate criminals. They are 13 percent of the population, and when the Census Bureau calls Hispanics white, it counts the white population as 78 percent. On a per capita basis, therefore, blacks were 2.1 times more likely than &ldquo;whites&rdquo; to be counted as hate-crime perpetrators. The Justice Department does not point this out.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Graffiti.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106857" alt="Graffiti" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Graffiti.jpg" width="550" height="413"/></a></p>
<p>The report includes 209 anti-white offenses committed by &ldquo;whites.&rdquo; It is hard to understand these crimes as anything but anti-white offenses committed by Hispanics who were classified as white.</p>
<p>The report says that in all of 2012, there were 3,968 crimes against persons that were, as the report puts it, &ldquo;motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender&rsquo;s bias.&rdquo; Of this number, 1,570 were simple assaults and 1,489 were acts of &ldquo;intimidation.&rdquo; The FBI <i>does not even count </i>these crimes in its Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) because they are so unimportant, so if we subtract them that leaves 909 cases of murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault said to be motivated by all the varieties of hate. In 2011 the UCR counted <a href="../../../xls/table_1_crime_in_the_united_states_by_volume_and_rate_per_100000_inhabitants_1993-2012.xls">1,206,000 violent crimes</a> in the United States, so those 909 hate crimes represent 0.075 percent of the total, or one in about every 1,350 violent crimes.</p>
<p>As for inter-racial crime, the best source of general information is the large-scale FBI survey called <i>Criminal Victimization in the United States. </i>In 2008, the most recent year racial data were collected, the American public reported 571,117 cases of violent crime and attempted violence by blacks against &ldquo;whites&rdquo; (as usual, the FBI lumps Hispanics in with &ldquo;whites&rdquo;) and only 90,717 such crimes by &ldquo;whites&rdquo; against blacks. (This means that any given black was <i>38 times</i> more likely to attack a &ldquo;white&rdquo; than the other way around &mdash; a good subject for a different article.) These acts of inter-racial violence included <a href="../../../content/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv0842.pdf">single</a>- and <a href="../../../content/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv0848.pdf">multiple</a>- offender crimes, and not all of them were reported to the police, but they add up to 661,888 attempted and successful crimes of interracial violence.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Knockout.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106858" alt="Knockout" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Knockout.jpg" width="550" height="306"/></a></p>
<p>How does that number compare to the interracial offenses in this report? The total of  2,695 official acts of &ldquo;hate&rdquo; violence committed for reasons of race (2,197) and ethnicity (588) &mdash; and this includes simple assault and &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; &mdash; are just 0.4 percent of the total interracial violence figure of 661,888. If we are to believe this report, only one out of every 250 acts of interracial violence is motivated even &ldquo;in part&rdquo; by racial animus.</p>
<p>But what about the 10 murders and 15 rapes that the FBI says were committed for reasons of bias? Six of the murders were motivated by &ldquo;anti-other religion,&rdquo; and are undoubtedly the six people Wade Michael Page killed when he shot up a Sikh temple. Two were described as anti-Islamic, one was anti-homosexual, and one was anti-white. Eight of the murders were by &ldquo;whites,&rdquo; one was by a black, and in one case the killer was not identified.</p>
<p>One of the rapes was anti-white, three were anti-American Indian, and one was anti-Hispanic.</p>
<p>Four of the rapes were anti-homosexual, four were anti-lesbian, and one was anti-bisexual. It&rsquo;s not obvious what would be an anti-homosexual or anti-bisexual rape; the report does not explain. Of the 15 rapes, six were reportedly by &ldquo;whites,&rdquo; two by blacks, one was by an otherwise unidentified mixed-race group, and six could not be identified by race.</p>
<p>One wonders how a victim could fail to identify a rapist&rsquo;s race, but there are other strange things in this report: 142 burglaries, 258 larceny/thefts, and 23 motor-vehicle thefts that were apparently motivated by &ldquo;in whole or in part&rdquo; by bias.</p>
<p>There are also 203 offenses bafflingly categorized as &ldquo;crimes against society.&rdquo; According to the fine print, this is a catchall category for &ldquo;hate crime data about drug or narcotic offenses, gambling offenses, prostitution offenses, and weapon law violations.&rdquo; The report does not explain how selling drugs or carrying an unlicensed pistol can be a hate crime.</p>
<div id="attachment_106860" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Prostitute.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106860" alt="Hate criminals?" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Prostitute.jpg" width="550" height="367"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hate criminals?</p></div>
<p>The fact is, there is really no point in trying to puzzle over what this report means because the data are meaningless. The Department of Justice itself concedes that not all police departments report data. Hawaii has simply opted out of the program, and New Jersey didn&rsquo;t bother to send any information for 2012.</p>
<p>At the same time, many states send in unbelievable data. Alabama&rsquo;s 4.7 million people produced only 6 hate crimes, whereas Kentucky&rsquo;s 4.3 million were guilty of 194. Texas, with 25 million people, reported only 52 hate crimes, while Tennessee, with only 6.3 million racked up 316. Thus hate crimes run from a low of 0.13 per 100,000 population in Alabama to a high of 11.97 per 100,000 in the District of Columbia &mdash; a preposterous 92-fold difference.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/StopHate1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106864" alt="StopHate" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/StopHate1.jpg" width="550" height="263"/></a></p>
<p>DOJ concedes that it does not get reports from all police departments, and that what it gets covers only 79.3 percent of the American population. However, even the places that do count hate crimes do it in wildly inconsistent ways. No fewer than 13,022 departments sent in information, so there was plenty of room for inconsistency, and of those departments, no fewer than 11,290 reported no bias crimes at all.</p>
<p>One might conclude that the hate-free departments are in out-of-the way, homogeneous places where everyone gets along, but no. Atlanta, for example, reported no hate. In fact, all 2.4 million people who lived Cobb, DeKalb, and Fulton Counties were free of hate. The 2.5 million Floridians who live in Miami-Date County and the 1.8 million in Broward County were equally hate free. The 1.3 million people of Hillsborough County, which contains Tampa, were just as fortunate, as were the 900,000 North Carolinians who live in the county that contains Raleigh and the 780,000 people of San Mateo County, California.</p>
<div id="attachment_106863" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AtlantaHate.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106863" alt="Atlanta: too busy to hate" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AtlantaHate.jpg" width="450" height="419"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Atlanta: too busy to hate</p></div>
<p>New Orleans had only two hate crimes, and Philadelphia&rsquo;s population of 1.5 million produced only 11.</p>
<p>Seattle, Washington (population 627,000; 85 hate crimes) and Lexington, Kentucky (population 302,000; 41 hate crimes) are, according to this report, some of the nastiest places in America, with per capita hate-crime rates that are <i>19 times</i> that of Philadelphia, <i>26 times</i> that of Chicago, and <i>85 times</i> that of Baltimore. It is easy to imagine majority-white police departments earnestly tracking down hate; the police in Baltimore and Philadelphia have their hands full fighting crime.</p>
<div id="attachment_106859" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Lexington.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106859" alt="Lexington, Kentucky: a nasty place to be" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Lexington.jpg" width="550" height="413"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lexington, Kentucky: a nasty place to live.</p></div>
<p>Even within the same state, there are strange disparities. The populations of Memphis and Nashville are about the same, but Memphis had 61 hate crimes to Nashville&rsquo;s 10. Dallas, Boston, and Louisville are a few of the cities that didn&rsquo;t bother to send in reports at all.</p>
<p>Obviously, this report is meaningless. Every year DOJ puts it out because Congress requires it by law. Every so often Congress adds new categories of victims for the police to track: handicapped people, homosexuals, Muslims. Police officers can&rsquo;t stand this kind of paperwork, and plenty of them probably just don&rsquo;t do it. The DOJ bureaucrats who actually have to compile the crazy stuff they get from the field are bound to know that the report they are writing is a farce, but they get paid anyway.</p>
<p><i>Hate Crime Statistics, 2012</i> is a perfect example of the confusion and futility that ensue when a multi-racial country refuses to accept the most obvious facts about race.</p>

People who don&rsquo;t understand statistics should never preach to those who do have an understanding beyond the simple regurgitation of those stats. One thing I&rsquo;ve learned throughout the years when looking at crime statistics is that there is always some uniformity and parallels you can find, whether they be along racial lines or just simply economic lines. These stats not only show no real and unbiased uniformity, they completely go against basic logic and reason.</p>
<p>How is it that black-on-White crimes are so prevalent throughout America, but anti-black &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; are supposedly higher?</p>
<p>How can a true perspective of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; even be attained when the entire data collection process is dictated to by people who insinuate White, non-Hispanic people aren&rsquo;t supposed to be victims of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; in the same capacity as non-Whites?</p>
<p>How in the world can anti-Amerindian &#8220;hate crime&#8221; incidents be roughly 1/6th the number of anti-White crimes, but the Amerindian population is only about 1/70th of the White population? If you have looked at crime data for the Amerindian population, then you would understand how odd these numbers are. This discrepancy of this alone is so beyond the realm of possible that you would have a better chance of being struck by lightning while riding your unicorn than you would for these numbers to be an accurate depiction of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; in America.</p>
<p>The only uniform and constant thing I&rsquo;ve noticed with these stats is that the White population of America is the only race, religion, or whatever &#8220;hate&#8221; category that is underrepresented as victims when you look at per capita numbers.</p>

<p>I also want to suggest that we take the next step and connect the dots. Why are these stats which are so worthless, put out by our government? Why do they portray whites the way they do? Why aren&rsquo;t interracial crime stats gathered anymore? Why is the collection of hate crime stats done so poorly and haphazardly, while at the same time groups like the $PLC use them as scripture in order to help their fundraising efforts and for demonizing the &#8220;extreme right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Add in some more dots (like the mainstream media&rsquo;s double standards in reporting different kinds of interracial crime) and I think a pattern starts to emerge. The notion that this system is institutionally racist against non-whites is absurd. These are clear examples of whites getting institutionally discriminated against. This system is anti-white!</p>

While we&rsquo;re on the topic of &#8220;other related articles&#8221; that should be written:<br/>
- how do those 909 episodes of actual crime break out along racial lines? Your point about inconsistent enforcement is key- crimes against whites are seldom interpreted as hate crimes- but even so, I suspect that in the violent crime category, whites would be overrepresented as victims and underrepresented as perpetrators. Angry whites may write graffiti, but are less likely to assault, IMO.</p>
<p>- For your &#8220;38 times more likely&#8221; number: it&rsquo;s astounding that this is true even given that Hispanics aren&rsquo;t broken out from &#8220;whites.&#8221; The mind boggles at how large that number could be if they were. Of course, this would take some serious labor to investigate.</p>
<p>- The inconsistent enforcement problem, which really points out how stupid hate crime laws are to start, could make the puppeteers look very bad. Start with Atlanta, with zero hate crimes, or Philadelphia, with very low numbers. Find several white victims of crimes committed by violent blacks, and prove the absurdity of the Orwellian thought-crime/hate-crime statutes.<br/>
Finally, Jared, Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

Then again, hypothetically, one hundred million White men and women could wake up tomorrow and realize that they bound themselves and put their own families on the path to destruction the second they accepted that kind of capitulation. They could just refuse to play the game.</p>
<p>The more they push, the more you have to push back. They more laws they pass to make you neuter yourself, the more laws you have to disregard. You try and silence me, I&rsquo;ll only get louder. You burn my house down, I burn your entire village. You try and make me disappear, I&rsquo;ll make sure five other people take my place. Anyone who really believes in truth and a rational and reasonable existence will always find some kind of solace and inner peace when following this model.</p>
<p>I said that to say that people should quit worrying so much about what they can&rsquo;t do, or what they aren&rsquo;t allowed to do, or especially what they might not be allowed to do in the future. Quit dwelling on that and just do what needs to be done. You don&rsquo;t need permission to survive. What you need is a collective of pro-White people that are on the same page.</p>

<p>In social comingling the air of political correctness and<br/>
what you&rsquo;re not supposed to say is evident and quite sickening.</p>
<p>An interlocutor at a social gathering recently uttered: &ldquo;The<br/>
Jews are in charge of Hollywood you know,&rdquo; Can&rsquo;t remember what the prompt was. Then, like clockwork, the obligatory &ldquo;not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that&rdquo; spews out with an agreeing friend righteously affirming &ldquo;nothing wrong with that at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two white guys I might add.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing wrong with whites being in charge of Hollywood either&rdquo; I<br/>
responded. (to deafening silence) </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll speak out always against this Marxist political<br/>
correctness despite my being accused by friends of being a &ldquo;buzz kill&rdquo; or being too serious on our time off.</p>
<p>I clearly see the strategy of social ostracism (and possible<br/>
work termination) for those who dare challenge this perverse &ldquo;religion&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s what it appears to be to me.</p>
<p>People outside of Amren are brainwashed and petrified of voicing any disagreement with the fashionable way of thinking. Fools. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always speak out. I don&rsquo;t care whose feathers I ruffle<br/>
or whose buzz I kill. I know you share this sentiment also. Appreciative of this forum.</p>

<p>This alone proves that the report is a farce … or maybe worse &mdash; a weapon against any racial group that the government chooses to target. I think we all know which one that is. </p>
<p>By the way, I have gotten into one discussion after another with &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; who scream both that &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is not a racial designation and that to desire that our southern border be made secure is racist against Hispanics. They have it both ways, and they&rsquo;re delighted to parade their foul double standards in front of our faces. </p>
<p>Also, I recall when we first began to hear about the supposed great need for government to provide special protection to special groups using &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; legislation. Plenty of people spoke up against it but were shouted down as racist bigots. And, of course, the opponents of such legislation were exactly right.</p>

In the UK there is the concept of &#8220;protected characteristics&#8221; which sounds a mite less in your face than &#8220;protected classes&#8221;, perhaps. An Englishman has none of this protection (although white invaders from Poland or Bulgaria do, but probably less protection than the preferred invaders from the Indian sub-continent, the Stans and Africa). The protected ones are favoured in employment opportunities, social housing and so forth. Once again the US state and the British state are working in tandem.</p>

<p>In medieval Europe it was Church ideology, with its notion of &#8220;original sin&#8221;, which only submission to church/state authority could save the individual (irrespective of social status) from eternal damnation for. Adapted to our more secular times, it is now &#8220;racism&#8221;, which again only submission to state ideology and authority can save us from eternal damnation for, not as heathens and heretics, as in the past, but as &#8220;bigots&#8221; and &#8220;racists&#8221;.</p>

He made two *major* mistakes in this article.</p>
<p>First of all saying Hispanic is a race   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s not. Wikipedia &#8220;white Hispanic&#8221; and &#8220;black Hispanic&#8221; if you don&rsquo;t believe me. Alexis Bledel, Cameron Diaz, Martin Sheen, and Christy Turlington are all &#8216;white Hispanics&rsquo; (obviously   &mdash;   don&rsquo;t even try to tell me that Alexis Bledel is not white; she&rsquo;s one of the palest people you&rsquo;ll ever see). Alex Rodriguez, Rosario Dawson, and Tatyana Ali (Will Smith&rsquo;s &#8216;sister&rsquo; on &#8216;Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&rsquo;) are all &#8216;black Hispanics&rsquo;. There are Asian Hispanics and Pacific Islander Hispanics   &mdash;   wikipedia it if you don&rsquo;t believe me. All Hispanic means is that you have a Spanish ancestor   &mdash;   however far back   &mdash;   in your family tree. The *race* he&rsquo;s thinking of is *mestizo* (mix of indigenous American and sometimes white and/or black   &mdash;   and they mark themselves as &#8220;other race&#8221; or &#8220;two or more races&#8221; on census forms because that&rsquo;s what they are. Don&rsquo;t tell me you guys don&rsquo;t know what mestizo is   &mdash;   every conservative news outlet was saying Zimmerman was mestizo during his trial!</p>
<p>Secondly, Jared Taylor mixed up the two main annual government crime reports in the United States. He talks about &#8220;the large-scale FBI survey called Criminal Victimization in the United States&#8221; (the third paragraph under that &#8216;lovely&rsquo; &#8220;I hate white people&#8221; graffiti   &mdash;   which, by the way, if it was done by Hispanics why the heck isn&rsquo;t it written in Spanish???). The FBI *doesn&rsquo;t* publish the Criminal Victimization in the United States report   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s published by the Department of Justice. The annual crime report published by the FBI is the &#8220;Uniform Crime Reporting&#8221; (UCR). Just google &#8220;criminal victimization in the united states&#8221; (the one he says is FBI) and you go straight to the Department of Justice website. Or *Google &#8220;fbi annual crime in the us report released 2011&#8243; or &#8220;The Nation&rsquo;s Two Crime Measures Crime in the United States 2004&#8243;   &mdash;   they<br/>
both confirm what I&rsquo;m saying&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a nobody and I know this stuff&hellip; Jared Taylor is not a race expert. Please for the love of God go listen to someone who knows what they&rsquo;re talking about:(</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-394534" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>***An Explanation Of Interracial Crime Rates   &mdash;   by Example of Playboy Bunnies***</p>
<p>Say you have ten Brazilian supermodels and one Asian Playboy Bunny (Grace Kim for argument&rsquo;s sake)   &mdash;   and they&rsquo;re having a giant lesbian orgy. </p>
<p>Assume though that they are very concerned about not hurting anyone&rsquo;s feelings   &mdash;   and so they make sure to be completely equal. Each one of the girls makes sure to hook up with each of the other girls for exactly one hour   &mdash;   no more, no less! </p>
<p>So, at the end of the night, Grace the Asian Sensation will have hooked up with ten Brazilians and no Asians, right? And Adriana Lima, Gisele, Alessandra, etc. (the Brazilian Bombshells) will each have hooked up with nine Brazilians and one Asian.</p>
<p>That means that Grace will have had exactly ten times as much interracial sex as any of the Brazilians.</p>
<p>Is it fair to say then, that Grace is a nymphomaniac? (Well, obviously she is   &mdash;   but compared to the other girls??) Or would it be more accurate to say that, due to the population differences, it was inevitable that Grace&rsquo;s rate of interracial sex would be far higher than any of the other girls?</p>
<p>Substitute &#8220;black&#8221; for Asian and &#8220;white&#8221; for Brazilian and &#8220;people killing each other&#8221; instead of having an orgy   &mdash;   and that&rsquo;s half your answer for why blacks have a much higher rate of interracial violence than whites. </p>
<p>(Blacks are only 13% of the American population. Whites are 72%. 72 divided by 13 = 5.5. Even if blacks are committing crime at *exactly* the same *rate* as whites overall, blacks&rsquo; rate of *interracial* crime still will be 5.5x higher than whites&rsquo; because of the population differences. Get it?)</p>
