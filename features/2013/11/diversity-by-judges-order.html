<h1 class="title">Diversity &mdash; by Judge&rsquo;s Order</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Stanley Hornbeck, American Renaissance, November 29, 2013</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
Legal teams must match clients by race and sex.</div> 
</div> 



<p>Support for <a>diversity has been a familiar feature </a>of the legal industry. Generally liberal and always image-conscious, law firms have long practiced affirmative action. Every year, events such as the Legal Inclusiveness &amp; Diversity Summit and the New York City Bar Association&rsquo;s Annual Diversity Conference &mdash; to name just a few &mdash; hand out awards to the most aggressive firms in diversity-hiring.</p>
<p>It is less known, however, that federal judges themselves can impose racial quotas on law firms that represent clients in class action suits. These are suits in which there are multiple complainants, treated together as a class, who are usually suing companies for providing faulty goods or services. In cases of this kind, judges may issue so-called &ldquo;diversity orders&rdquo; to require the lawyers representing the class be diverse enough to &ldquo;effectively represent&rdquo; the members of the class. These orders, which require race and/or sex matching between class plaintiffs and plaintiff counsel, have apparently been met with few complaints by the firms that are forced to rearrange their litigation teams.</p>
<p>A 2007 diversity <a href="../../../GildanOrder.pdf">order</a> issued in class action proceedings involving a clothing company stated that because &ldquo;the proposed class includes thousands of participants, both male and female, arguably from diverse backgrounds . . . [it is] therefore important to all concerned that there is evidence of diversity, in terms of race and gender, in the class counsel.&rdquo; The judge ordered that both co-lead counsel firms &ldquo;make every effort to assign . . . at least one minority lawyer and one woman lawyer . . . .&rdquo; Because this was a private, civil matter, it has not been publicly disclosed whether the firms complied with the order, but lawyers almost invariably do what judges tell them to do.</p>
<p>In another case, U.S. District Judge Cathy Seibel of White Plains, New York, recently instructed plaintiff firms applying for lead counsel roles in a class action suit against Bayer AG to consider adding female lawyers to their teams.</p>
<p>The legal justification for these orders relies on a highly strained reading of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which govern the way counsel is appointed in class action cases. In 2003, following criticism that lawyers were putting their interests above those of their class-member clients, the rules were amended to grant judges more power to approve and regulate class counsel.</p>
<p>Under the amendments, law firms were to be approved according to four factors having to do with such things as experience and resources that affect a firm&rsquo;s ability to represent clients. A fifth factor was added, allowing a judge to consider &ldquo;any other matter pertinent to counsel&rsquo;s ability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.&rdquo; This does not specifically mention race or sex, and whether it can be read that broadly is highly questionable. But such a reading means that any ideological federal judge can issue an order on the makeup of a legal team.</p>
<p>Diversity orders could be very burdensome. Blacks and Hispanics are <a href="../../../content/dam/aba/migrated/marketresearch/PublicDocuments/lawyer_demographics_2012_revised.authcheckdam.pdf">4.8 percent and 3.7 percent</a> of licensed attorneys, but are 13 percent and 16 percent of the population. If these orders become the norm, law firms would have no choice but to hire by quota. Women are <a href="../../../content/dam/aba/migrated/marketresearch/PublicDocuments/lawyer_demographics_2012_revised.authcheckdam.pdf">30 percent</a> of licensed attorneys &mdash; a four-fold increase since 1980 &mdash; but this is not enough to meet strict diversity orders either.</p>
<p>Just last week the Supreme Court refused to consider a legal challenge to diversity orders. By refusing to take up the case, it implicitly approved the practice, which means it could spread to other kinds of lawsuits. The case was <a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CCAF-Martin-Petition-as-Filed.pdf"><i>Martin v Blessing</i></a>, which was about a diversity order issued by Manhattan U.S. District Court Judge Harold Baer. The appeal originated from a 2010 class action suit against satellite radio broadcaster, Sirius XM Radio. According to the class complaint, the company, then called Sirius Satellite Radio, broke antitrust laws when it raised fees on its subscribers following the 2008 takeover of its only industry rival, XM Satellite Holdings. In addition to objecting to an &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo; settlement and an &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; lawyers&rsquo; fee award (plaintiffs got a 5-month price-freeze on their subscriptions, while the lawyers got $13 million in fees), class members also objected to the diversity order. Judge Baer required that counsel &ldquo;ensure that the lawyers staffed on the case fairly reflect the class composition in terms of relevant race and gender metrics.&rdquo; The firm, Grant &amp; Eisenhofer PA, no doubt mindful of the windfall fees such suits often produce, complied with the order and dutifully tailored its counsel to achieve Judge Baer&rsquo;s racial matching objectives.</p>
<p>In the petition to the Supreme Court, class member Nicholas Martin asked that only the diversity order be considered. He argued that it violated the Equal Protection part of the Fifth Amendment&rsquo;s Due Process Clause by failing to offer any evidence that racial matching could benefit a class&rsquo;s representation.</p>
<p>On appeal before the Second Circuit, a three-judge panel declined to rule on the diversity order, finding that the class members lacked standing to sue (the court couldn&rsquo;t find that Mr. Martin and the other class members actually suffered any harm because of the diversity order.) However, according to &ldquo;friend of the court&rdquo; briefs filed on behalf of class members by the <a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FINAL-PLF-BLESSING-AC-BRF.pdf">Pacific Legal Foundation</a> and the <a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Blessing-amicus-final1.pdf">Center for Individual Rights</a>, there is precedent in other circuit courts for standing to be granted to plaintiffs when they are &ldquo;irrationally classified by the government on the basis of race&rdquo; or when their &ldquo;rights are affected by discrimination against third parties,&rdquo; such as in cases of criminal defendants whose jurors are included or excluded because of race. In both kinds of cases, according to the briefs, contrary to what the Second Circuit has asserted, specific injury was not required for claimants to proceed.</p>
<p>The briefs in this case argue that because Judge Baer required class counsel to classify members &mdash; irrationally &mdash; by race in order to assign to them a proportionate number of non-white and female lawyers, any member of the class should have standing. As for the argument about third-party damage, any class member, they argue, should be able to mount a challenge because Judge Baer clearly ordered that discrimination be practiced against white male lawyers &mdash; even though those white male lawyers did not file their own complaint.</p>
<p>Typical of diversity-proponents, Judge Baer, who frequently issues diversity orders, neglected to explain what benefits could possibly flow from forcing law firms to choose attorneys whose races match those of the class. He also failed to cite any statutory law or case precedent to support his order. He explained only that law firms are &ldquo;behind where they should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There have been racial preferences in law school admissions since the 1978 <i>Bakke</i> ruling, but apparently this hasn&rsquo;t produced enough non-white lawyers for Judge Baer. In any case, rules on ethics and professional responsibility already require that lawyers take clients as they come, and that all clients&rsquo; interests be zealously represented. A vague complaint about law firms being &ldquo;behind&rdquo; does not meet the exacting standards of reasoning normally required by courts of law.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2002/2002_02_241/"><i>Grutter v Bollinger</i></a>, which affirmed the use of racial preferences in higher education, the justification offered by Justice Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor in her controlling opinion likewise made no sense. She said law school admissions could take a &ldquo;holistic view&rdquo; of student applications, which could include race as a factor, but that administrators must be sure not to treat race as a <i>determining</i> factor. It is nearly impossible to show how such a vague standard has been violated.</p>
<p>Justice O&rsquo;Connor also wrote that a university&rsquo;s goal of achieving a &ldquo;critical mass&rdquo; of racial minorities was permissible, but using racial quotas was not &mdash; as if it were possible to distinguish between the two. These inexplicable standards used to justify diversity by the courts seem intended to allow ideological judges-as well as university administrators-to bypass true constitutional scrutiny and to practice racial preference policies by stealth.</p>
<p>Interestingly, both Judge Baer and former Justice O&rsquo;Connor appear to be text-book WASPs. Judge Baer is an 80-year old veteran and a graduate of Yale Law School-not some radical upstart or minority with a chip on his shoulder. He seems to find no irony in trying to remedy past discrimination &mdash; if that is even the basis of his order &mdash; by mandating discrimination against white men. By working against his own group interests, he is an example of what a &ldquo;good&rdquo; education and life in the elite class do to group instincts.</p>
<p>If the Martin petition had been granted Supreme Court review and had resulted in a ban on diversity orders, firms could have gone back to picking lawyers by ability. That would obviously be in their interests, but plaintiff firms have put up with diversity orders for years without objecting to them. Mr. Martin was represented by a nonprofit public-interest law firm, the <a href="http://centerforclassactionfairness.blogspot.com/">Center for Class Action Fairness</a>. The only organizations filing friend-of-the-court briefs on the class&rsquo;s behalf were other nonprofits, not private law firms.</p>
<p>The 2003 amendments of the class counsel certification rules were intended to protect class members, but it&rsquo;s unclear how attorney-client racial matching achieves this. If it could be shown that lawyers and clients of different races have a problem communicating, wouldn&rsquo;t lawyers of different races have the same problem among themselves? Judges who issue diversity orders are clearly motivated by social engineering rather than justice. The Supreme Court&rsquo;s failure even to consider a ban diversity orders means they will only become more common.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-389854" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Before this gets away and my own world class sense of snark ruins the conversation, we should realize that this is only about class action lawsuits. So it&rsquo;s basically affirmative action make work for black lawyers, the ones we found out in AR yesterday are going to no tell motel law &#8220;skooz.&#8221; The real legal work on the part of plaintiffs in class actions that tells the tale of whether the suit wins or not will be done by competent white lawyers. It&rsquo;s just that they will for outward appearances have a few AA tokens on the team, who of course will be able to split the legal fees per capita should the suit win.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about criminal cases. First off, in most cases, the criminal defense attorneys in a criminal case are irrelevant anyway, it&rsquo;s up to the prosecutor to sell twelve people unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, almost all criminal cases are disposed in a plea deal, so the defense lawyer in that case, i.e. most cases, is just a fancy wheeler dealer with the DA&rsquo;s office. And third, as racially sensitive as we are officially, (not any of us, I&rsquo;m just talking in general), there&rsquo;s no way that the system is going to force saintly black criminal defendants to have incompetent AA black defense attorneys, because of this fiction that has developed (mainly because of TV and movies) that good defense attorneys are somehow singlehandedly able to help their clients beat the rap, and sometimes incompetent counsel is used as grounds for appeal of a conviction.</p>

<p>From Wiki&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;The earliest operations on the pericardium (the sac that surrounds the heart) took place in the 19th century and were performed by Francisco Romero,[9] Dominique Jean Larrey, Henry Dalton andDaniel Hale Williams.[10] The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. He ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24 year old man who had been stabbed in the left axillae and was in deep shock upon arrival. Access was through a left thoracotomy. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours, but became ill with increasing temperature and he ultimately died from what the post mortem proved to be mediastinitis on the third postoperative day.[11][12] The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Dr. Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896.[13][14]&#8221;</p>
<p>The Black history month says Williams was the first, but a little research shows this statement is inaccurate. It&rsquo;s a bit more complicated. Williams was apparently a good surgeon, and looking at his picture&hellip;well he looks White&hellip;</p>

It turned out that he wasn&rsquo;t giving any meds - for years. He just didn&rsquo;t feel like it so he was just tossing them in the garbage. Someone just saw unopened medicine in his trash pail one time too often. That would just never occur to me. I guess it&rsquo;s ingrained in some people that the job is what you&rsquo;re paid for and so that is what ya DO. I&rsquo;m aware that some white nurses have given lethal doses of stuff to kill patients, but I just never saw anyone shrug and stand there - saying to me &#8220;I don&rsquo;t get it why you are always running around all the time.

Escaped Nazi Germany, came to the States, puttered around in Hollywood for years, ended up doing a disturbingly hilarious stand up comedy routine in his autumn (er, winter) years in New York City. Appeared as a frequent guest star on the David Letterman Show where he would pretend to get riled by Letterman. His act consisted of bizarre philosophical rants delivered in almost Hitlerian style.</p>
<p>Find him on Youtube for some chuckles if you like weird, edgy humor. Impossible to truly explain. Passed away a few years ago but worked up until his death. RIP Brother Theodore. Funny guy.</p>

<p>Weather&rsquo;s been fantabulous here. Cool, crisp evenings, warm but non-sweaty days. </p>
<p>I gorged myself on Thanksgiving but recovered after a nap and a couple of epic and brutal &#8220;downloads&#8221;. Great tradition.</p>
<p>Sunlight&rsquo;s less now, so kind of getting seasonal depression, but at least I&rsquo;m not sweating through a South Carolina Summer. Humidity. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny looking at the comments/votes thing. Some folk play well to the crowd, others, like Engleman, get mixed attention, which is better than none I suppose. My 5.72 rating was not so bad. Trying to figure how to rate all posters based on combination of efficacy and volume. Day off, you know?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-403651" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There is a great amren article about pathological altruism. Here is a summary:</p>
<p>From Pathological Altruism, by Barbara Oakley et al.:</p>
<p>&#8220;PA is generally defined as a sincere attempt to help others that<br/>
instead harms others or oneself, and is &ldquo;an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one&rsquo;s own needs.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&#8220;PA is likely when people &ldquo;falsely believe that they caused the<br/>
other&rsquo;s problems, or falsely believe that they have the means to relieve the person of suffering.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;the false belief that one&rsquo;s own success, happiness, or well-being is a source of unhappiness for others.&rdquo; PA &ldquo;often involves<br/>
self-righteousness&rdquo; and can result in &ldquo;impulsive and ineffective efforts to equalize or level the playing field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;glorifying altruism is both recent and Western.&#8221; &#8220;a society must<br/>
have a certain level of material wealth before it can value certain<br/>
kinds of altruism.&#8221; &#8220;only Europeans have decided &ldquo;to elevate altruism above other culturally promoted ideals, such as tribal patriotism and glory-at-arms, which our ancestors considered paramount.&rdquo; They have gone even further, extending tribal altruism to the entire world, though &ldquo;some other cultures consider this Western quality to border on madness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the whites who say it is madness are accused of racism&hellip; They are told that &#8220;Humanity as a whole might benefit the most if individuals made no sacrifices for their local group.&#8221; </p>
<p>Seems the whites are the only race who don&rsquo;t know about the<br/>
prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma! They cooperate! But all the other groups don&rsquo;t. Check that game theory: we lost, they win.</p>
<p>Again from that book &#8220;if groups want to act altruistically towards other groups they should at least look for groups that follow the same rules.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the growing chorus of the dangers of football, concussions, CTE and so on? I sense a cabal of class action and other trial lawyers moving in for the kill. Of course, they won&rsquo;t kill football, just like they didn&rsquo;t kill the tobacco industry, because they know not to kill the golden goose. But the class action and trial lawyer vultures associated with a certain political party whose name starts with D sees the NFL and its franchises and owners sitting on boat loads of money, and want some of it.</p>

Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t cooperate ends up wearing a pair of cement shoes. The common man doesn&rsquo;t say anything because, well, the only good jobs in our economy come from you and your cohorts.

<p>Not surprising, whatever feminism may want you cannot unravel eons of evolution with a couple or three generations of propaganda and ideology. Women tend to be stabilizing influences on men, traditionally and naturally serve as the real anchor of (K style) family life.</p>
<p>I believe that in a TRUE meritocracy some women would become executives, presidents, rocket scientists, astronauts, multiple martial arts champions&hellip;even generals, whatever&hellip;but&hellip;</p>
<p>The majority would gravitate naturally toward a more domestic, traditional role, prefer their mate to earn more thereby allowing her to spend more time raising children (at which she is better, more able to multitask, detail oriented). </p>
<p>Certainly there would be exceptions to the rule and that would be fine. Some men may be better at running a home than their women and some women better at earning a living than their men&hellip;and so what?</p>
<p>But this psuedo-Marxist liblefty human meat grinder system of ours brooks no subtlety. Percent goes in, equal percent must come out! So decrees Democratic Totalitarian ideology!</p>

<p>The point is when talking about merit and the best person for the job, there will always be a disparity between men and women, with men being far more valuable and deserving of positions, in some cases exclusively.</p>
<p>A female martial arts champion is a stupid example, as women only compete with women. There would never be a female martial arts champion when competing with men. Men have a physical and hormonal advantage that technique cannot overcome.</p>

<p>Irrelevant? It&rsquo;s completely relevant. To paraphrase I said that yes, according to what I have seen there is a small average difference in IQ between men and women, also that there is greater range in men&rsquo;s IQ meaning that there are more male geniuses retards than female.</p>
<p>Irrelevant? I also went on to point out the kind of role women serve in general - a stabilizing role. I also stated that in a true meritocracy.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-403676" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think women evolved differently than men: their activities were<br/>
different so it seems to me logic that their bodies through natural<br/>
selection evolved differently! It is naive for me to think that women<br/>
are different in the outside but the same than men in the inside. </p>
<p>Not only because of the difference in body size but also in the difference of use. A man&rsquo;s heart is 25% bigger, because it pumps blood in general in longer distance than a woman&rsquo;s heart and thus, for any given work rate, the faster heart rate means that most women will become fatigued sooner than men. Women have less bone mass than men, but their pelvic structure is wider. This difference gives men an advantage in running efficiency. Men have 50% greater total muscle mass, based on weight, than do women and a woman who is the same size as her male counterpart is generally only 80% as strong. </p>
<p>So men usually have an advantage in strength, speed, and power over women. No surprise, men hunted and were hunted while the women stayed in the cave or camp whatever and gathered berries and roots or tend to the children and therefore not only the body developed differently but brains did too, Edward O. Wilson, of Harvard University, said that human females tend to<br/>
be higher than males in empathy, verbal skills, social skills and<br/>
security-seeking, among other things, while men tend to be higher in independence, dominance, spatial and mathematical skills, rank-related aggression, and other characteristics. Please websearch Renato Sabbatini &#8220;Are There Differences between the Brains of Males and Females?&#8221; and articles on Richard Lynn&rsquo;s studies in BBC and dailymail websites.</p>
<p>These days, new testing has been done by Flynn and he claims that women have closed the gap and even inched ahead in this battle of the intelligent sexes. I didn&rsquo;t read his book but there is at least one problem: most &#8220;men&#8221; and &#8220;women&#8221; tested were between the ages of 15 and 18!!! (he collected data from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Estonia and Argentina on scores on a standard IQ test, called the Raven test. Each country tested at least 500 men and 500 women). &ldquo;In all of those samples, women are the equal of men, perhaps scoring a half point or a point higher,&rdquo; Flynn said.<br/>
In my opinion, 15 to 18 is too young for testing the genders, especially as boys/young men mature later than girls/young women.</p>

<p>That same fact of white male superiority (on average) applies to a class of people bringing a class action suit. They too would likely be better off represented by white male counsel than with AA black male counsel or even white female counsel. So by what right does a judge impose inferior counsel on the very people who have the most to gain if they are represented optimally by white males and the most to lose if represented ineptly by AA black males or white/black females? Last I heard the gubmint doesn&rsquo;t own the law firms hired by a class to bring the class&rsquo;s suit. Whatever a judge&rsquo;s politics can he legally disqualify counsel simply because counsel consists of, let&rsquo;s say, four white males?</p>
