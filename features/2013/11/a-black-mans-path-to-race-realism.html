	                	<p>Never in 1,000 years did I imagine that I would end up the person that I am today: a black race realist &mdash; someone who believes IQ is normally distributed and that averages may differ among races the same way other genetic variables do. Over the years, I noticed that people are fired up about this or that aspect of evolution, but that the question of genetic differences in race and IQ were off limits. And after many years of painful experience, I gradually went from &#8220;Why not?&#8221; to &#8220;This is the way it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two things contributed to my conversion to race realism. The first was my training &mdash; I have an MS in chemistry &mdash; and the second was a lot of life experience.</p>
<p>To start at the beginning, I grew up in a two-parent family in Michigan, and went to church every Sunday. Both my parents worked at decent jobs with good benefits. One thing that my late father always taught me is that &#8220;life is about thinking for yourself and doing what is good, right, and best for you.&#8221; A necessary consequence of this was making up my own mind on what was relevant to me.</p>
<p>I graduated from high school in the top 10 percent of my class and was offered a full scholarship at a university in a neighboring state. I graduated, and after taking a break from school, went back to complete a master&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>How did my training help lead to my conversion? A chemist looks at a system, without prejudice, and in a process called abductive reasoning, tries to choose the best explanation. If I had to distill my most life-changing experiences and what I learned from them, they would be as follows:</p>
<p><b>Going to church (ages 12 to 18)</b></p>
<p>We went to a small church that was not as most people imagine black churches &mdash; no whooping and hollering and fainting. It was a very conservative Church of Christ congregation that did not even allow instrumental music. In my years there I saw a great deal of inept leadership. For example, although the church had ample funds, it took two years to put in a new door because the leadership spent so much time bickering. Even though I was only 13 years old, I spent an afternoon making calls to get prices on the installation on a new door, but that still was not enough to get them take action.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BlackCongregation.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106668" alt="BlackCongregation" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BlackCongregation.jpg" width="550" height="440"/></a></p>
<p>At that time I didn&rsquo;t know it, but I was observing an experiment with a control group. There were two nearby Churches of Christ, one in the same town and one in the town next door. One was white and flourished, and the other was black and collapsed a few years after getting together enough money for a new building.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, &#8220;OK. Maybe I&rsquo;ve had some bad luck and the problem is these particular black people.&#8221; When I went to college, I left the church, never to return, but that led to my next experience.</p>
<p><b>Getting a job (ages 18 to 21)</b></p>
<p>Like many college students, I needed to work during the summers, so I got a job at a nearby airport. In that county, airport businesses had to have minority ownership, and there were two major concessions at the airport. The one I worked for (let&rsquo;s call it Company A) sold gifts and the other one, Company B, sold food. The general manager at Company A was black and so were most of the store managers. Much of the management of Company B&rsquo;s food stalls was also black. What did I see? Disaster.</p>
<p>Although my company had 18 to 20 gift shops, there was not a single day on which every store could open, because employees would not show up for work. There was not a single week in which someone was not led off in handcuffs for stealing. There was not a single week in which someone from Company B did not walk into my store to buy candy and gifts with gift certificates he had stolen right out of the cash register of his store. (The airlines gave customers gift certificates when planes were delayed, which happened a lot. Apparently the managers at Company B thought that stealing vouchers out of the register was not quite the same thing as stealing cash.)</p>
<p>Cash receipts from sales were regularly taken to the central office and put in a cash room. What wasn&rsquo;t stolen out of the registers by employees would just get stolen right out of the cash room by the loss prevention manager. He lasted only a year, and was fired for stealing tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible for a store to lose money when it sells at airport prices, but eventually that chain of stores had to downsize because of losses.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, &#8220;OK. Maybe I&rsquo;m just working around the wrong type of black people.&#8221; And that led to the next life-changing event.</p>
<p><b>Finishing my bachelor&rsquo;s degree (ages 18 to 22)<br/>
</b><br/>
When I went to college, I noticed that out of 120 chemistry majors, I was one of only two blacks. I noticed that in the &#8220;lighter&#8221; disciplines, such as ethnic studies, the students got a lot blacker. I spent one college year in England and I took an elective black studies course there on the assumption &mdash; correct &mdash; that there would be fewer political overtones. When I came back to the US and visited the Black Studies Department, I got a lot of hostility when I suggested that black studies would not help anyone get a job, and that it might be better to learn how to live with all kinds of people. One of the faculty members told me, &#8220;Kiss my black ass.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BlackStudies.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106670" alt="BlackStudies" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BlackStudies.jpg" width="550" height="332"/></a></p>
<p>I thought to myself, &#8220;OK. So maybe I didn&rsquo;t go to the right school. Maybe I need to go someplace else.&#8221; Years later, I went to another school to get my graduate degree, and that led to the next event.</p>
<p><b>Finishing my graduate degree (ages 25 to 26)</b></p>
<p>As a graduate student, to make ends meet, I took a job at a filling station several miles from school. It was in a poor area, and about half the patrons were black. At that time, you could buy blunt cigarillos for $2.87 for a pack of five, or you could pay $0.99 for just one. (For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, some people smoke cigarillos but others cut out the tobacco and fill them with marijuana.) So, night after night, I sold single cigarillos to the same people who paid more to buy them one at a time. Night after night, I swiped Food Stamp cards for black customers to buy one ice cream at a time. Everything that you buy one at a time in a gas station is usually 50 percent more per item than just buying a pack of five, six, or ten, but the math skills needed to make that calculation were too much for my customers.</p>
<p>There was also a lot of shoplifting, and 99 percent of it was by blacks. A common trick was to distract me, by asking for a price check, and then stealing something. It was also common to pump gas and drive off without paying. I called the police a couple of times, and they would go through the motions of telling the perps never to come back to the store again. A week later, the perps would be right back. The police never made any arrests because cops must actually witness the crime. They won&rsquo;t just take someone&rsquo;s word for it.</p>
<p>There were a lot of Mexican day laborers, roofers and landscapers, who came to buy things.  Most of them had just come from work and just wanted to get a beer and sit down. They were different from most of the black customers, who didn&rsquo;t work at all, and were just trying to think of a way to steal something.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Laborers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106662" alt="Laborers" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Laborers.jpg" width="500" height="400"/></a></p>
<p>While I lived in that state, I made a visit to a rheumatologist for a checkup. All the doctors at the hospital were Jewish. Everyone who was mopping a floor or tending a cash register was black.</p>
<p>I thought, &#8220;OK. Maybe I need to move to a different country.&#8221;</p>
<p>It happened that I had had a Jewish friend who had moved to Japan to work and save money, and through a fortunate series of events I found myself living and working there as an English teacher. Later, I went to Taiwan to do the same work, but the job scheduling was not satisfactory. From there, it was an easy hop to Mainland China, where the work was more abundant and the scheduling was better.</p>
<p><b>Life in China (since age 26)</b></p>
<p>I have now lived in China for 11 years, and for the last five, I have been teaching chemistry and writing personal statements for students who need them as part of their applications to get into American colleges. Almost every aspect of living here has been informative from a race-realist point of view, but very negative from a &ldquo;black&rdquo; point of view. In this country, <i>everything</i><b> </b>you see associated with black people is bad. And, of course, how can I fail to understand why Chinese people don&rsquo;t want to hire me to work for them?</p>
<p>A few observations:</p>
<p>1. Where blacks live. In China, Africans are concentrated in Guangdong Province, which basically makes low-value exports such as shoes and toys. The State Bureau of Foreign Experts, which is the agency that lets foreigners live and work here, does not issue work permits to black people, so the Africans in Guangdong are illegal aliens living in shantytowns. The Guangdong government and the people of the province can&rsquo;t distinguish African from American or South American blacks, but they don&rsquo;t want any more of them.</p>
<div id="attachment_106663" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Africans.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106663" alt="Blacks in Guangzhou, Guangdong&rsquo;s capital." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Africans.jpg" width="550" height="409"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blacks in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong.</p></div>
<p>Jiangsu Province makes electronics, and Shandong makes heavy machinery. In these relatively high-tech areas you can go for weeks without seeing any black people. This is exactly what you would expect: Africans working off the books in low value-added industries.</p>
<p>2. Foreign students. Most Chinese higher education is <a href="http://www.chinesemedicalnews.com/2012/11/chinas-medical-schools-produce.html">substandard</a>. This is why so many Chinese students who have the means study abroad. Last year <a href="/">236,000 Chinese</a> were studying in the United States. However, this does not stop second-rate Chinese universities from accepting foreign students. Some even teach medicine <i>in English</i> to students from abroad.</p>
<p>But if they want to offer low-grade education that not even Chinese would pay for, they have to go somewhere to find idiots to fill up the seats. You guessed it: The first place they go to look for students is <a href="http://www.csc.edu.cn/laihua/newsdetailen.aspx?cid=122&amp;id=1399">Africa</a>!</p>
<p>This is actually worse than it sounds. Most Chinese don&rsquo;t speak English. The number of Chinese who actually know medicine and can teach it in English is bound to be tiny. Half of all Chinese doctors don&rsquo;t even have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. On the other hand, in 22 African countries, English is an official government language. What this means is that Africans can&rsquo;t set up schools that function in an official language of their own country, so they go overseas to be taught by people in China who can&rsquo;t speak English.</p>
<p>3. Jewish Temples. There are only about 14 million Jews in the world, and only about 10 percent of them are Orthodox. Yet, in China there are no fewer than five Orthodox temples and Jewish community centers that serve kosher food. A lot of intelligence went into getting around the Chinese government&rsquo;s ban on non-approved religions, and getting animals slaughtered in a kosher manner for the very few<b> </b>Jews who keep Kosher.</p>
<div id="attachment_106669" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/OhelRachelSynagogue.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106669" alt="Ohel Rachel Synagogue in Shanghai." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/OhelRachelSynagogue.jpg" width="550" height="413"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ohel Rachel Synagogue in Shanghai.</p></div>
<p>Jews have set up their community centers as business corporations in order to get the proper licenses. Their leaders have also schmoozed the right people. This takes finesse. Kosher slaughter also takes finesse. There is no law against it, but it takes resourcefulness to find a cooperative livestock dealer and fly in a <i>shochet</i>, or trained kosher butcher. The church I used to attend couldn&rsquo;t even get a door installed.</p>
<p>4. Development assistance. China now offers a lot of development assistance to Africa. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that just 55 years ago, something like 30 million Chinese people starved to death in a famine. Also, China was unstable from the middle of the Qing Dynasty &mdash; about 1793 &mdash; until 1976 (the end of the Cultural Revolution). The people had not had a new idea since the Sui Dynasty, that is to say, since the Sixth Century. But even after all that<i> </i>they now manage to build first-class cities.</p>
<p>If you have Chinese people in a fishing village, they will turn it into a city. If you have the same number of black people, it will stay a fishing village. Or if you let them take over a city &mdash; Detroit, for example &mdash; it will stop from being a functioning, gleaming city and become something more like a fishing village.</p>
<p><b>Social Media, etc.</b></p>
<p>1. Facebook is depressing. Probably about 40 percent of my Facebook friends are black, and they share way too much<i> </i>about the minutiae of their lives. You have to read about every single time<b> </b>they pull into McDonald&rsquo;s. They also come up with about 90 percent of the worst, most poorly reasoned arguments. You name it, I&rsquo;ve read it: Black Egypt, Marxism, legal pontification on the Trayvon Martin case by people who can&rsquo;t spell.</p>
<p>2. Trayvon Martin. I&rsquo;ve argued on Facebook until I was almost blue in the face that when someone attacks you and you fear for your life you are justified in defending yourself. I have also pointed out that most black people are killed by other black people, and that proportionately far more white people are killed by blacks than the other way around. On any given day, about seven black people are <a href="../../../xls/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2012.xls">killed by other black people</a>. Anyone bright enough to read the statistics from the Department of Justice can find out these things. And there can be no bias in these numbers since the Justice Department is headed by a black man, right?</p>
<p>3. Prislam (prison Islam). Muslims are looking for people of low intelligence to convert. Where do they go to find them?<i> </i>Prison. Who do they find there? Black people.</p>
<div id="attachment_106666" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Prislam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106666" alt="Friday prayers at Graterford Prison in Pennsylvania." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Prislam.jpg" width="550" height="413"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Friday prayers at Graterford Prison in Pennsylvania.</p></div>
<p>It just became too much for me. It uses up all your energy to argue with even one unintelligent person. Try arguing with 40 million people, most of whom don&rsquo;t have it together.</p>
<p>For all these reasons I married a Chinese woman and we have a son. I don&rsquo;t want him to identify as black. We speak Chinese at home, and I have decided that he can learn English as a second language &mdash; maybe after age five. We&rsquo;ve had his DNA tested, and he is actually more Han Chinese (48.6 percent) than any other race (9.3 percent white, 42.1 percent black).</p>
<p>We are converting to Judaism, and therefore adopting a cultural environment that is as far from black as I can find. My son has options. He can think of himself as strictly Jewish. His names are Hebrew, and can be used in either the Sephardic or Ashkenazi traditions.</p>
<p>Or, he can think of himself as Chinese. Surprisingly, Chinese people have a better attitude towards those they think they are assimilating. My son has a Chinese passport, and if he decides to stay in China and can play the role of someone who accepts the glory of Han culture, he&rsquo;ll do fine.</p>
<p>Or maybe he can think of himself as American &mdash; race unspecified. For his sake, I don&rsquo;t want him to think of himself as &#8220;black,&#8221; because that just has too much baggage.</p>

<p>No one is asking you to &#8220;hate&#8221; any Black or Jewish person. Choosing to not have black &#8220;friends&#8221; (that you wax so warmly about), does not mean you hate blacks. Your advocacy for having black &#8220;friends&#8221; sounds little different than calls for tolerance and diversity (your use of the word &#8220;hate&#8221; is a favorite of diversity mongers). Or the Christian who deludes himself into thinking Jews can be entrusted with positions of influence within a Christian society (yes, I&rsquo;m Christian [not Christian Identity]). </p>
<p>If what you are really arguing for is working with black race realists to further the cause of Ethnonationalism, that is an entirely acceptable proposition. Calls for general unity (being &#8220;friends&#8221;) between Black and White is entirely different matter and incompatible with White Nationalism which is dedicated to separation of Whites and Blacks. So which is it?</p>
<p><i>But that&rsquo;s not a reason I can&rsquo;t find common ground with a highly intelligent black man who is clearly dedicated to the truth, whatever it is. That is my goal too.</i></p>
<p>Finding common ground with a Black person has nothing to do with being his &#8220;friend&#8221;.</p>
<p>And what &#8220;truth&#8221; (your words), is this black race realist dedicated to exactly anyway? Apparently not a race realism which excludes marrying / procreating outside one&rsquo;s own race. Which is a rather odd and meaningless definition of race realism.</p>

Marrying a China woman and converting to Judaism is pretty bizarre. It really hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with faith and belief, but rather a frantic excuse to abandon your upbringing and culture. Who can blame him for that?</p>

I&rsquo;d handicap that at something approaching zero pretty fast. Also, this guy doesn&rsquo;t have seem to have the residual logic or honesty to notice that the Chinese are renowned xenophobes and will tend to purge anyone (i.e., non-Han) when any societal pressure is encountered. I admire them for that, but to think (i.e., given current realities) that he and his family are not our problem anymore is not very realistic. He clearly doesn&rsquo;t understand where economic wealth is derived and assumes that it falls off some global turnip truck where you can covert it to whatever is your heart&rsquo;s desire (e.g., today he sees that Jews are on top and maybe the Han so I&rsquo;ll have me one or two of them Chinese Jews and all will be well, etc.).</p>

Indeed, you&rsquo;re preventing them from throwing their (our!) genes away by mating with a cool colored person.  Here&rsquo;s a question: if you had a daughter of marrying age, and her two suitors were a young Clarence Thomas and a young Piers Morgan, and she left the choice to you, whom would you chuse?  Would you chuse happiness and a good life with a son-in-law whom you&rsquo;d like (Clarence), but put an end to your genetic line, or would you be willing to have a terrible life but continue your line (Morgan)?  For me, it&rsquo;s Piers Morgan all the way!  Happiness is overrated!</p>

He is pro-life for whites, pro-abortion for everyone else.  Yes, the black rate of abortions is substantially higher than the white rate, but that is probably attributable to white men and women being more conscientious about using birth control (call it a pre-abortion).  Whites breed too little as it is, so I want to do what I can to discourage them from having abortions.  The problem we face is the poison has been well-set in many white women&rsquo;s minds that the option to slaughter their own children in the womb is a necessary element of self-determination rather than a form of suicide.  I do prefer not emphasizing abortion until we have united whites under other banners.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-380812" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to read the opinions of a fellow black race realist.  Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll write about my journey to race realism and what I&rsquo;m planning to do to help spread the truth.  Unlike Mr. Murdock, my acceptance of HBD resulted from reading books like Why Race Matters by Michael Levin.  Personal experience with blacks had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m amazed that Mr. Murdock married a Chinese woman.  Since becoming a race realist I&rsquo;ve decided that I can never marry and procreate with a white or East Asian.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be moral to do so.  My children would be more intelligent as a result of such a union while my husband&rsquo;s offspring would be less intelligent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I wish Mr. Murdock the best of luck in all his future endeavors.</p>

<p>I have always said that there are none I pity more than the intelligent and civil blacks.  Theirs is a world that must surely be filled with despair and sadness, knowing that they cannot fit in with other blacks because they cannot abide the abject stupidity of the majority of the race.

<p>A black with an IQ of 130 or above is perhaps the loneliest and most pitiable of all people.</p>

<p>at least 3 SD&rsquo;s above - and that&rsquo;s assuming 2 things that I don&rsquo;t think are altogether true - </p>
<p>1) the average black American has an IQ of 85 - given that black Africans have an IQ of only 67 I think its probably a few points lower</p>
<p>2) the SD of their IQ&rsquo;s is 15 - I suspect its less than that, i.e., their range of IQ&rsquo;s is more clustered around the average, as is the Asian IQ.   </p>
<p>Assuming both my assertions are correct then the probability of a black having an IQ of 130 or more is about 1 in 100,000 or even 1 per million individuals.</p>

<p>This is not necessarily true. You may have more intelligence genes than the average person of your ethnic background (if you are here, that is almost certainly so). If you are as smart as your husband, then congratulations! You won the genetic lottery and you can pass on those genes to your children.</p>

Arthur Jensen found that when comparing the children of black couples with IQs of 120 to the children of white couples with IQs of 120, the former were not as smart.  I believe they averaged a 99 IQ while the white children averaged a 110 IQ.</p>
<p>Assuming I married a white man with the same IQ as mine (about 127), our children would not be as smart as the children of two white adults with IQs of 127.</p>

Your story about the church you attended was quite enlightening. It&rsquo;s rare to read such nuanced observations about blacks from an insider&rsquo;s perspective. </p>
<p>I cannot imagine how frustrating it must have been to grow up as an intelligent black man surrounded by average blacks. I&rsquo;m a somewhat above-average IQ white person who grew up surrounded by below-average IQ white people, and that was bad enough, but it must have been nothing compared to your daily experiences (especially since you are almost certainly more intelligent than me, considering your Chemistry background).</p>
<p>I wish you and your family good luck with your life in China.</p>

Even if the mother has below-Chinese-average IQ, and even though the child will regress towards the mean, the father having an IQ of 141 should assure he&rsquo;ll still be above 100. I&rsquo;d guess he might end up somewhere around 110-115?</p>
<p>The only way I could see for the child to have a below-100 IQ would be if the mother were very unintelligent (such as having an IQ below 80 or something) and I highly doubt that this is the case.</p>

I do often see African immigrants, who are 100% black, working hard to make a living and get ahead.  They usually aren&rsquo;t rocket scientists but they do the best with what they&rsquo;ve got.  It&rsquo;s the American blacks, who typically have about a 20% white ancestry, who whine and complain about how white racists are holding them back.</p>
<p>American popular culture is particularly odious.  It may have its worst effect on blacks but whites are certainly be affected as well.</p>

Of course IQ is on a continuum, so there will always be the very few blacks who &#8220;get it&#8221;. The majority who don&rsquo;t will always be there too. </p>
<p>I never would have been on a site like this only a few years ago. But similar to this man, my life experience and education (finishing an MS program myself) have allowed the truth to free me from any biases and liberal indoctrination within the higher education system. The more education and life experience you have, the more obvious things become. Liberals say &#8220;You can&rsquo;t generalize!&#8221; until they&rsquo;re blue in the face. Want to know the best comeback to that? Tell them, &#8220;Actually, I can generalize. Generally, Florida is warmer than New York. Generally, the sky is blue. Generally, Chemistry is harder than Black Studies. Generally, men prefer larger TV&rsquo;s to smaller TV&rsquo;s&#8221;. All they have to do is take it one step further: &#8220;Generally, blacks have low IQ&#8221;.</p>

I agree with about 90% of his article. However, he is being a bit kind in this quote. The Black fishing village would transform into a dilapidated harbor ridden with pollution and disease.</p>

And there&rsquo;s a lot of what I call &#8220;negro crazy.&#8221; People who are negro crazy have a drama playing in their heads and think everyone is supposed to play their part in it.

<p>My work in a black neighborhood irrevocably turned we away from Martin Luther&rsquo;s &#8220;dream.&#8221; This week a fellow worker said his was glad people in my generation were dying off since we were so full of hate.

The first born was an idiot (figuratively speaking, not literally).  He was a not-too-bright starving musician. He never attended college even though he could have gone for free at the prestigious private university where his dad was vice-president. He was living in a garage apartment behind his parent&rsquo;s house at age 50. The sixth and last child graduated first in his law school class and became a state assistant attorney general and a multimillionaire.  The four siblings in my family also demonstrate a similar IQ spread, with 1 brother clearly the brightest and 1 sister clearly the dumbest.</p>

Imagine a world where the media, educators, politicians, and all prominent people publicly professed their sincerely held belief that men are no more prone to violence than women.  Now suppose that a man, initially accepting these beliefs, kept finding evidence to the contrary.  He notices that all the gang members in the tough part of town are male.  He finds that 80% of the murder suspects in his city are male.  He notices that special forces units are always male.  He notices that professional fighters are almost always male.  And so on.  So he reluctantly concludes that the old &#8220;sexist&#8221; beliefs are correct after all   &mdash;   men tend to be more violent than women.  Does that mean that he hates himself for being a man?

Kind of like Israel is run by and for Jews, although they have non-Jews in their population.  Many commenters here think an ethnostate for whites is the only way whites can reasonably be sure of being dragged down by black and drown dysfunction, as is currently happening in the U.S. today.  But for the terrible decision not to colonize freed slaves following the American Civil War (colonize meaning, getting them the hell out of the U.S.A.), the U.S. would have been, at least by the mid-1960s, more of a white ethnostate than it was (about 90% white back then).  One can argue that the U.S.A. was largely a white ethnostate, as our naturalization laws provided from 1790 to 1954 that only free white persons could become naturalized citizens of the U.S.A.</p>

<p>     I do not hear self hate in your words, and I absolutely do not make a moral or ethical judgement regarding your having jumped ship. You&rsquo;re trying to marry up  &mdash;  I cannot hold that against you; it is what every normal living organism tries to do.<br/>
    As you were once a Christian, I will leave you with these lines from the Bible which I hope will fortify you:<br/>
Fear of God (self knowledge) is the beginning of wisdom.<br/>
The truth will set you free.<br/>
Seek ye your own salvation.<br/>
I consider you an ally and inasmuch as you support the continuation of White Civilization, I likewise wish you and your family every success and happiness in life.</p>

In the 1980 s when the  Reagan era inspired hope for Conservative change for Black America, this guy might have gone Thomas Sowell style Conservative, married Black and stayed in. America, now that&rsquo;s not an option. He has to go to China, marry Chinese, convert to Judaism.

You have to spend your teen years acting dumb just to fit in socially with other Blacks. This stunts your intellectual development and if you fall into the wrong crowd maybe even prison or death.</p>
<p>If you make it to university, you will be surrounded by middle class pro-Black radical types (ie Toure or Melissa Harris-Perry) who think you&rsquo;re cool because you grew up in the hood. They expect you to sign on to every stupid cause they can think of to prove how down they are with &#8220;real&#8221; Black people. </p>
<p>If you graduate with a degree in a non-soft major, recruiters will view you with suspicion. Are you really this smart? Here answer this or that stupid question. If you manage to pass the gauntlet and get hired, your White &amp; Asian colleagues think you are an unqualified affirmative-action. You will get questions such as &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; or comments such as &#8220;You&rsquo;re smart&#8221;, gee thanks. </p>
<p>Things get better though. You begin to earn more money. Your dating options improve and life goes on.</p>

My experience is most mixed race men are more hateful towards White men, want to argue, compete, fight with White men, bed as many White women as possible. They have higher IQ to compete, do well, so they see the masses of poor low IQ Blacks as just like them, only they are on the bottom because of White racism. Mix race men like Harry Belefonte and Brian Gumble go this way, go for ANC hate Whitey politics.</p>
<p>Barack Obama has a lot of this, had to prove he was really Black, African enough.</p>
<p>Mixed race women don &#8216;t seem to have these issues and generally like being in Whiter places.</p>

<p>Murdock could choose to be a voice for a kind of black racial consciousness based on truth rather than politically correct leftist dogma. Instead he&rsquo;s taking a pretty extreme individualistic point of view which seems to be about starting a process of converting his genetic legacy from all black to Chinese and possibly Jewish. An effort which I suppose is understandable, but at the same time a bit strange.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t a positive race realist based eugenics program for blacks be based on the idea of getting the best and brightest blacks to reproduce while trying to prevent the worst and least smart from doing so? Wouldn&rsquo;t this be the better approach rather than to simply trying to breed out black DNA and the black race altogether?</p>

It would better if the high IQ blacks could somehow become the leaders of the rest, but it seems the average black is attracted more to the thug than the intellectual.  Perhaps a high IQ black nation could serve as an example to the rest?  Or would it just be invaded and overwhelmed by the others?</p>

Not that it would ever happen anyway, but I was just kind of considering what might happen if they were all collectivised into a nation, instead of being brought down and &#8216;mixed back in&rsquo; to the ones who are not capable of higher civilisation. Give it a few hundred years and maybe they will evolve to a standard of life much better than what we know would otherwise ensue. </p>
<p>I agree that if such an unlikely thing was to happen, they would be under threat from being overwhelmed by those on their periphery and beyond, who would be seeking a &#8220;better life&#8221;. But as long as a White civilisation is present, I think they will all just stick like magnets to us as usual, instead of showing us that they can make it on their own.</p>
<p>I had to laugh at a recent BBC radio 4 show which proposed the ideas of these new super-cities of the future and how things could be started again from scratch to be orderly and high tech. </p>
<p>Not one of them discussed demographics and what would happen if Blacks were to populate one of these freshly built super-cities. It was all taken as a given that with this fresh start and everything worked out and ready on a plate, the population would prosper and enter into some new age of greatness.  LOL. </p>
<p>The way things are going, I think the idea or fantasy is ridiculous. Good job they weren&rsquo;t being truly serious with it, it was just a discussion and scientific/technology slot.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what type of new super-cities they were discussing but I think the idea of new city-states on leased land - as per Paul Romers &#8220;Charter Cities&#8221; (though he has liberal ideas) could be the salvation of the white race, as they would enable voluntary segregation by default, so to speak.  I have been thinking and writing about this very idea for many years and I think the time is ripe.</p>

I don&rsquo;t get this.  The mean IQ for Ashkenazi Jews is high due to the religious tradition that, over thousands of years, selected for the most intelligent.  Converting to Judaism does not give your IQ a boost.  Am I missing something?</p>

In any case, a very interesting story. Thank you for telling it.</p>

<p>f(μ) = ½ − [σ√(2π)]⁻¹ ∫(x̄,μ) exp{ −[(x−x̄)/σ]²/2 } dx</p>
<p>where σ=12.4 and x̄=85. So 1 in 9 blacks has an IQ over 100. One in 46 blacks has an IQ over 110. One in 420 blacks has an IQ over 120. One in 7030 blacks has an IQ over 130. One in 217709 blacks has an IQ over 140, the minimum IQ for genius.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the distribution of IQ in US resident whites is 103±16.4, meaning that one white in 83 has an IQ over 140 and is a genius.</p>

<p>But, be honest - this a tactic Jews have been doing for a long time - moving to new non Jewish areas/countries - changing their last names to blend in with the locals, confuse the truth that they are Jews and have a different history, different agenda.</p>
<p>The Bolshevik commander of the Soviet Red Army - Leon Trotsky (sounds like a &#8220;Russian&#8221;) was originally named &#8220;Lev Davidovich Bronshtein&#8221;</p>
<p>Karl Marx - sounds like a solid &#8220;German&#8221; Karl.</p>
<p>Or then there is the American tough guy Right wing talk show host Michael Savage. His original name was &#8220;Michael Weiner&#8221; back when he was a 1960s Leftist New Yorker.  Somehow, I doubt Michael would have a large White Conservative audience for &#8220;the Weiner Nation.</p>
<p>How about Comedy Central&rsquo;s Jon Stewart? Sounds like a Scottish nobleman. His real name Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see anything superficial here but I do see desperation rather . As far as White perspective of the &#8216;other&rsquo; goes, with many of you, it is a &#8220;damned if you damned if you don&rsquo;t &#8221;  situation. </p>
