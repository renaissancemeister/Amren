<div class="intro-paragraph">
A conversation with Alain de Benoist.</div> 
</div> 



<p><b>American Renaissance: You have said that modernity is the enemy of identity. Could you explain this idea further?</b></p>
<p>Alain de Benoist: When one considers modernity, one must consider two meanings of the word. The first is known to everyone: It is the changes of life that come with more material wealth. But modernity is also the product of an ideology that appeared in the 17th and 18th century with the Enlightenment. It is an ideology of progress, of which the basic idea is that mankind will always be better. The future will be better than the present and the present is better than the past. For this ideology, the past has nothing to teach us. The past is a graveyard of archaic customs and irrational constraints. Instead, man must use his reason to decide by himself what he wants.</p>
<p>Modernity also takes a unitary view of history. History is not cyclical, as it was for the Greeks, but is a straight line. This idea comes from Christianity and Judaism, which posit that there is an absolute beginning and an absolute end to history. Mankind is likewise unitary. All peoples must go through the same stages, and reach the same level of development. This is the myth of development, of technological progress.</p>
<p>Thus, everything that is new has value because it is new. There is a fetishism of the novel. So when you speak of modernity you must consider not only the material dimension but also the ideological dimension. Modernity is intrinsically antagonistic to collective identities because such identities are an obstacle to the march of progress towards a unitary mankind.</p>
<p>Of course, modernity has a strong economic component. In Europe it was linked to the rise of the bourgeois class and its commercial and merchant values. This is the problem of capitalism. It wants to organize more markets &mdash; a world market, a planetary market &mdash; and collective identities fragment this market.</p>
<p><b>Europeans have frequently criticized the United States as a materialist society, but is not every society materialist? Is it not part of human nature to always to want more?</b></p>
<p>You are right. In that sense I would say that today we are all Americans. And it is true that the desire to have more is part of human nature. The difference is that much of European religion and philosophy are based on values that are more important, on the belief that for moral or religious or philosophical reasons, we must not submit to greed and to the appetite for wealth. This was different in America because of the protestant Calvinist idea of the elect &mdash; God shows his approval by giving wealth. You know Max Weber&rsquo;s theory of the link between Protestantism and the rise of capitalism. I think these things make a big difference.</p>
<p>In Catholic countries money is always suspect &mdash; even though everyone wants more of it rather than less. You can see that in the fact that in France it would be impossible for a wealthy man to be elected head of state. No one would vote for a millionaire. The idea would be repulsive. But in America if a candidate is a millionaire it shows he is a success and has ability.</p>
<p>So in Europe people hide what they have. They don&rsquo;t say how much they earn. In America there is a passion for numbers, and everything is a calculable quantity. Americans know how much they paid for everything. When American tourists go to the Eiffel Tower they ask, &ldquo;How many steps to the top?&rdquo; They do not understand the difference between quantity and quality.</p>
<p><b>Is there anything besides Catholicism that has protected Europe from the same levels of materialism?</b></p>
<p>No longer. Today, everyone looks at the same films, listens to the same music, lives in the same kind of houses. This is something that greatly concerns me. I have traveled a great deal, and every year I see the world becoming more similar. I call this the ideology of sameness. This ideology can take religious and not-at-all religious forms, but the central idea is that we are all part of mankind, that we are brothers of the same family. There may be differences but they are unimportant and should be either eradicated or transformed into mere folklore. American Indians do their dances for the tourists but this is not traditional life.</p>
<p><b>What is the solution to this problem of sameness?</b></p>
<p>To see solutions we must conceive of globalization as a dialectic. The more the world is homogenized, the more there is rebellion. Thus, the impulse that homogenizes the planet creates new kinds of fragmentation, new kinds of divisions. Sometimes this resistance can be excessive &mdash; it can take the form of terrorism, for example.</p>
<p>The solution is to work locally. I strongly believe in localism. Localism means more direct democracy, it means working to create liberated spaces. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t believe so much in politics. I believe that the time of political parties is over. Parties take each others&rsquo; places, but they are not real alternatives. In France it is the Right or the Left, or the Left or the Right, and everything remains the same.</p>
<p>That is the reason why so many people are fed up with what we call the &ldquo;new class&rdquo; of politicians, financiers, media. There is a widespread feeling that this class does not understand the daily life of the citizens, that it is remote, not committed to a particular nation, that it has common interests instead with an international new class. This is one of the reasons for the rise of the so-called populists parties, which is the most interesting political phenomenon in the last 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p><b>What are some other examples of this resistance to globalization?</b></p>
<p>Some countries resist very well. China, for example. I was in China not long ago. Of course you can see young people fixated on their video games, their iPods, iPads, and BlackBerries, but I think the Chinese leaders have a very clear view of the state of the world. Few countries really try to think about the future. The United States, yes, certainly. Russia and China as well, but in Europe, there is nothing.</p>
<p><b>You think Americans are thinking seriously about the future?</b></p>
<p>Not the American people, but the think tanks and government agencies think very seriously about the future.</p>
<p><b>More so than in Europe?</b></p>
<p>Yes, certainly. We have politicians but nothing like your think tanks. Maybe some political clubs, but nothing else. The politicians just want to be reelected, so the future for them is next year. They don&rsquo;t think globally about the world.</p>
<p><b>If global capitalism is the enemy of identity, can you describe a type of economic organization that would be a friend of identity?</b></p>
<p>Economic life must not be reduced to free exchange and to commercial and market values. An economy must take social realities into consideration, and must not be free from political authority. It is perfectly possible to have an economy of social solidarity that includes a private sector, a public sector, as well as a sector for voluntary associations, such as workers&rsquo; cooperatives. The dictatorship of the financial markets must be destroyed. An economy must be based on real production and not on financial speculation. We must fight against the de-localization caused by globalization, which results in labor-market dumping, and harms the working classes by putting downward pressure on salaries. Free exchange between nations is good for everyone only if those nations are at approximately identical levels of economic development.</p>
<p>In Europe there must be reasonable protectionism that guarantees salaries and revenue. We must also promote, to the extent possible, consumption of goods where they are produced, with an emphasis on local transport and economies of proximity. The re-localization of economies is a way to maintain collective identities and also to restore social ties and local democracy in a public space in which citizenship is expressed.</p>
<p><b>Would you hope for a Europe that is more locally autonomous?</b></p>
<p>I am personally in support of a politically unified Europe, but this would be a Europe in which as many decisions as possible are made locally. We speak of the principle of &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo; according to which, as much as possible, and at the lowest possible level, people decide the matters that concern themselves.</p>
<p><b>That was the original idea of the United States. Every state was to have great autonomy.</b></p>
<p>But in the history of the United States the meaning of the word &ldquo;federalism&rdquo; has changed. Now when we say &ldquo;federal&rdquo; it means the central government, even though things were different in the beginning. The history of states&rsquo; rights is complex.</p>
<p><b>But that is my point. The European Union shows the same tendency. A central government always wants more power. Switzerland seems to be one of the few exceptions to this rule.</b></p>
<p>I like Switzerland very much. I would like the Swiss model extended to the whole of Europe. Do not forget that the difference between the central power in Europe (the so-called European Commission) and in the United States is that in Europe it is not even elected by anybody. There is no democratic legitimacy to it. I don&rsquo;t have any illocutions about the value of the kinds of elections you have in the United States, but at least there is an election. Not in France. We elect a European parliament that has almost no power, and the only reason people take an interest in that election is because it is an indication of which parties are most popular within your own nation.</p>
<p><b>Do you think it is possible to have a politically united Europe that really does leave local decision-making to local people?</b></p>
<p>Yes. You see that in Switzerland. Of course, it is a small country.</p>
<div id="attachment_106774" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Switzerland.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-106774" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Switzerland.jpg" alt="Switzerland is divided into 26 &quot;cantons,&quot; each of which enjoys considerable autonomy." width="550" height="389" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Switzerland.jpg 550w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Switzerland-300x212.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Switzerland is divided into 26 cantons, each of which enjoys considerable autonomy.</p></div>
<p>But in the history of Europe you have two competing models. One is the nation-state, of which France is the perfect example, but of which England and Spain are also examples. The other model is empire: Italy, Germany and so on. I think the model of empire is much better because it does not concentrate power. It leaves rights and political autonomy to the different countries and regions. A recent model would be the Austro-Hungarian empire. It contained 35 different nationalities, but it worked pretty well. Of course, it was implicated in all the troubles in the Balkans.</p>
<p><b>For many countries, the United States is an unpleasant presence, but is this simply a reflection of its power? Is this just our version of the French <i>mission civilisatrice </i>or British empire-building, or is there something different about the way America imposes its ideas on the world?</b></p>
<p>Certainly England, France, and Spain had great influence on the world, but the difference is that they are old countries. They have behind them 2,000 or 3,000 years, and in such a long period of time you have many different conceptions of politics. Not so in the United States. From the beginning, you have the myth of the City on a Hill, that you were the new chosen people, that you fled corrupt Europe with its monarchies and that you would build a new society that would be the best in history.</p>
<p>This goes hand in hand with American optimism. There may be many problems but in the end technology will solve them. Technology creates problems and yet more technology will solve them. This feeling, which is shared by so many Americans, can lead to isolationism or Wilsonianism, in which you want to colonize, though not in the old way. You want all people to be Americanized.</p>
<p>I notice that when I am in America I always hear music &mdash; music or television &mdash; even in restaurants. But it is always American music. I never hear any singer or music that is not American. In a few restricted circles you may see a French film, and people may know of Edith Piaf or Maurice Chevalier. But if you go to Europe or anywhere else you will hear the same music! Not only, but mostly. When it is not French, it is American music. Why don&rsquo;t the French listen to Chinese music or African music or German music or Spanish music or Danish music? And it is the same for films. We see all the American films. We do not see all the German or Italian films, even though those countries are very close to France.</p>
<p>Globalization is the vehicle for all this. English becomes the universal language; if you don&rsquo;t understand English, you can&rsquo;t really use the Internet. So here are two reasons for the impact of America. One is the ideological reason but the other is the effect of pure power. This is normal.</p>
<p><b>From the European point of the view, surely someone like George W. Bush must have been impossible to understand because he was not Machiavellian or even sophisticated.</b></p>
<p>To us he looks like a moron. In Europe a good politician or statesman is someone who is cultivated in matters of political philosophy and literature, who has a deep knowledge of the world, who sees history as tragedy. He is someone who is a realist in politics, who doesn&rsquo;t try to hide his interests behind the smokescreen of moral discourse. Americans are completely different. They put their hands on their hearts and speak of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, where I saw a quotation from President Reagan that went something like this: &ldquo;There are no limits to growth or human happiness if people can freely choose their dreams.&rdquo; What does that mean? Nothing. But you can see that sort of thing everywhere.</p>
<p>I was recently in New York and visited Rockefeller Center. There you have tablets with quotations from Nelson Rockefeller. &ldquo;I believe in humanity. I believe in love. I believe in the pursuit of happiness but nothing is more important than love.&rdquo; This man&rsquo;s life was making money, but he says there is nothing more important than love. He was not a lover, he was a financier. This sort of thing is very strange for Europeans.</p>
<p>And there are so many things that have come from America to Europe and settled there, such as gender studies &mdash; people like Judy Butler, who are completely mad. The crazy kind of feminism. I am not against feminism. There is a good kind of feminism, which I call identitarian feminism, which tries to promote feminine values and show that they are not inferior to masculine values. But this American version of universalist egalitarianism says there is no difference between men and women. It concedes there is a small difference: you are born with one sex or the other, but it&rsquo;s not very important. What is important is that gender is a social construct, and you can make the parallel with race. Race and sex, they don&rsquo;t exist because they are social constructs; they are only what your mind says they are.</p>
<p>You may know that last May the French government decided &mdash; it is the law now &mdash; that the French Republic &ldquo;does not recognize the existence of any race.&rdquo; Race does not exist, but racism exists. We must fight racism, which is presumably a hatred of something that does not exist. Curiously, these people claim to value diversity, but how can there be diversity if races do not exist? Many of these ideological fashions came from America.</p>
<p><b>Many Americans and Europeans who are frustrated with the direction in which their country is going speak of the possibility of systemic collapse. Do you foresee such a collapse?</b></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t foresee that because it is impossible to foresee anything. The main characteristic of history is that it is always open, therefore unpredictable. All the important events of the last decades were not foreseen, beginning with the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the Soviet system. Some people with a catastrophic and pessimistic view do not realize that history is open. They think nothing can change, yet change is always possible because human history is open. I don&rsquo;t <i>foresee</i> any collapse but I believe that there is a strong <i>possibility</i> of a general collapse.</p>
<p>At least in Europe we have the impression that the political system has exhausted all its possibilities. There is also the financial crisis, which is, for me, a structural rather than contingent crisis of capitalism. You cannot live forever on credit. Look at the public debt of the United States &mdash; my God. We always add a bit more, a bit more, a bit more. But &ldquo;more&rdquo; and &ldquo;better&rdquo; are very different things. No tree can reach the sky, so it will certainly collapse.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are ecological, demographic, and immigration problems. We are clearly at the end of something. Probably at the end of modernity. Never in my life can I remember a time in which all possibilities were as open as they are today. We are in a world of transition. During the cold war, things were simple &mdash; two blocs &mdash; but not anymore. What will become of Russia? What will become of China? In Africa we will have demographic growth &mdash; like the public debt in the US!</p>
<p>So I think collapse is possible and it may be necessary, but you cannot rely on it. You cannot sit in your chair and say, &ldquo;Well, dear friends, I am waiting for the apocalypse.&rdquo; That would be like the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses: &ldquo;The end of the world is nigh.&rdquo; One world may be ending, but not the world.</p>
<p><b>Collapse may be necessary for what?</b></p>
<p>For change. Americans have lived ever since the beginning of their country under more or less the same system, so it is very easy for them to believe that theirs is a natural system. In Europe we have known so many systems, so many revolutions, so many conflicting opinions. I refuse to be constrained by inevitability.</p>
<p>Under the current system only marginal reforms are possible. In France, the National Front is rising in a very interesting way. It is becoming the leading political party, which is very strange when you remember that because of the electoral system it has only two members in the Chamber of Deputies. But even if Marine Le Pen were elected president &mdash; I do not think it will happen but I cannot exclude it &mdash; there would be no great changes. We would live in the same kind of society, looking at the same films, playing with the same electronic games, and so on.</p>
<p><b>You have spoken about how complex and multiple identity is. It is composed of language, history, profession, ethnicity, sex, etc. but why can race can never be part of a collective identity &mdash; at least for white people? </b></p>
<p>You mean in Europe?</p>
<p><b>I mean anywhere. </b></p>
<p>It is even more forbidden in Europe. In the United States, it is accepted by most people that races exist &mdash; and in my mind to accept race is very different from racism &mdash; but in Europe that is not so. In the United States you have racial statistics. You can go to the government and find race statistics on everything, including crime and social patterns. The collection of these kinds of statistics is forbidden in Europe &mdash; certainly in France.</p>
<p>In France you may categorize people as foreigners or French citizens but many immigrants have French citizenship. Sometimes they receive it automatically when they are born there. So sociologists who want to study a racial question must look indirectly at such things as medical statistics. No one knows how many blacks there are in France. We have an idea, of course, but officially race statistics are forbidden because race does not exist. Such race statistics might be used by racist people. They could use findings about crime, for example.</p>
<p>But to return to the question of identity, I am concerned that the people in France who want to defend identity seem to be the first not to know what identity means. They give only a negative definition of it: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an immigrant.&rdquo; Alright, you are not an immigrant, but what are you? &ldquo;I am French.&rdquo; But of course you are so many other things as well. You are a man or a woman, you are a journalist or a producer, you are gay or straight, born in a particular region, etc. Identity is complex.</p>
<p><b>How do you see yourself as different from Identitarians?</b></p>
<p>If I compare you and me, the first difference is that I am aware of race and of the importance of race, but I do not give to it the excessive importance that you do. For me it is a factor, but only one among others.</p>
<p>The second is that I am not fighting for the white race. I am not fighting for France. I am fighting for a world view. I am a philosopher, a theoretician, and I fight to explain my world view. And in this world view, Europe, race, culture, and identity all have roles. They are not excluded. But mainly I am working in defense of a world view. Of course, I am very interested in the future and destiny of my own nation, race, and culture, but I am also interested in the future of every other group.</p>
<p>Immigration is clearly a problem. It gives rise to much social pathologies. But our identity, the identity of the immigrants, all the identities in the world have a common enemy, and this common enemy is the system that destroys identities and differences everywhere. This system is the enemy, not the Other. That is my basic credo.</p>

<p><b>Is there anything in particular you would you like to say to an American audience?</b></p>
<p>What I would say to America is to try to be a bit more open to the rest of the world. Try to know other countries and not just to visit them as tourists. As tourists you don&rsquo;t see much. You need to understand that throughout the world people can think differently. I don&rsquo;t say they are better or worse, but accept these differences, because a world of difference is a richer world. The wealth of the world is diversity &mdash; its genuine diversity.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-385728" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There&rsquo;s an inherent contradiction as this article is presented.</p>
<p>De Benoist denounces universalist modernity as the primary driver behind wrecking particular cultures, ethnic groups, races and identities, but then turns around and says she&rsquo;s not an identitarian and has no interest in saving any particular race or culture or ethnic group, his beaux ideal is all the particular groups of the world uniting in a universal maneuver in order to beat back universalism to ensure that all the particular groups can continue being particular groups.</p>
<p>People that are part of particular groups that have some sort of limiting factor and do not comprise the whole of humanity don&rsquo;t fight and organize around abstractions like &#8220;saving particularism,&#8221; they do so around the well being of their own group. Identitarianism, nationalism, racialism, whatever you want to call it, things which De Benoist opposes, is the only real effective way to combat globalism.</p>
<p>He is right, though, in stating that our modes of economic organization need to focus a lot more on real value added pursuits like mining, manufacturing, agriculture and sci-tech progress, and that transnational trade should only be less restrictive between countries that share a lot in common.</p>

<p>Instead, he is whining about how things should be if only others (99.999% of whom have no idea of even who he is) would do what he thinks should be done based on a model he came up with while chain smoking in his tiny apartment in muslim occupied france.</p>
<p>Harsh? Yes. Not the point.</p>
<p>The point is de Benoist here is typical of nationalists, white and otherwise.</p>
<p>They deal in the world of getting (begging?) people to agree with their pet theories. Instead, they should be measuring the ability of such theories to make effective change.</p>
<p>Basically, he&rsquo;s rationalizing why things have happened rather than trying to come up with models for making things happen. Excuses for why things are the way they are rather than plans for making things better based on available resources, power, influence and access to money, systems, government etc.</p>
<p>This is in STARK contrast to the liberals who followed the openly satanic specific methods of Saul Alinsky (literally dedicated a book to Lucifer, lol) to infiltrate nations and seize power over time despite having no power, less money and being despised, feared and (rightfully) suspected of being communist agents of a hostile foreign power.</p>
<p>These people were scum with a capital S. But they were successful because they were results oriented rather than armchair theorists.</p>
<p>Well&hellip;a tiny group of white supremacists could do the same thing. One might even say, the current powers that be are particular vulnerable due to complete and utter incompetence.</p>
<p>But only if we stop chasing phantoms and focus on being effective.</p>

<p>* Identitarianism, nationalism, racialism, whatever you want to call it, things which De Benoist opposes or is at least agnostic about, is the only real effective way to combat globalism and universalism<br/>
*De Benoist denounces universalist modernity as the primary driver behind wrecking particular cultures, ethnic groups, races and identities, but then turns around and says he&rsquo;s not an identitarian and has no interest in saving any particular race or culture or ethnic group, his beaux ideal is all the particular groups of the world uniting in a universal maneuver in order to beat back universalism to ensure that all the particular groups can continue being particular groups.</p>
<p>(A part of me agrees in as much as I might wish to go to Mexico to hear their music or eat their food, but I don&rsquo;t want their culture to take over America as it has in so many ways, or go to one of the Islamic countries if I want to *experience* their culture, but not be forced to have to listen to the call to prayer 5 times a day coming from a speaker mounted from the local city hall roof-top, or see traditional American icons taken down because they might offend the senses of an Islamic (fill in the blank) Alas, the immigration acts passed in order to bring cheap labor from 3rd world countires has altered America, some say, to the degree that going back, even if it is only ten years ago, is absolutely impossible&hellip;this must the the *wasp* in me talking.)</p>

<p>In Europe there must be reasonable protectionism that guarantees salaries and revenue. We must also promote, to the extent possible, consumption of goods where they are produced, with an emphasis on local transport and economies of proximity. The re-localization of economies is a way to maintain collective identities and also to restore social ties and local democracy in a public space in which citizenship is expressed.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been politely asked to remove myself from many conversations for asking this same thing. The same people saying race doesn&rsquo;t exist are some of the same people who believe the world will be much better if/when we are all the same, but they are also the same people who champion the be-all-end-all world of diversity. Anyone with even a dash of common sense can tell you this rationale and these realities can&rsquo;t exist in the same space.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-385773" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>In the &ldquo;American version&rdquo; of gender studies, says Benoist, gender is a mere social construct, and &ldquo;you can make the parallel with race.&rdquo; He also notes that in the United States &ldquo;most people accept that race exists.&rdquo; </p>
<p>If his observations are accurate, and I believe they are, then evidently there are at least two &ldquo;American versions,&rdquo; one of which does and one of which does not believe that sex and race are merely social constructs. All that tells us is that the latter rules and is wrong and that the opinion-setters and policy-makers should be put out. </p>
<p>I think we all know that. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that it won&rsquo;t happen, though. We&rsquo;re headed the way of France: &ldquo;…The French government decided &mdash; it is the law now &mdash; that the French Republic &#8216;does not recognize the existence of any race.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, unless I&rsquo;m misreading him, Benoist attributes to Christianity and Judaism the notion that &ldquo;all peoples must go through the same stages, and reach the same level of development.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be interested in knowing what causes him to believe that. </p>
<p>In his concluding ode to diversity, Benoist suggests that Americans &ldquo;try to be a bit more open to the rest of the world. Try to know other countries and not just to visit them as tourists. As tourists you don&rsquo;t see much.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Even assuming that this observation (a familiar position of the left) is accurate, by what methods does he suggest we remedy our supposed insularity? In what capacity should we travel to China, Kenya, Iran, and India if not as tourists?</p>

<p>Guest, you say that; &#8220;the French Republic &#8216;does not recognize the existence of any race.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, it that were true, then the races can&rsquo;t acknowledge the existence of the French Republic. If in the consciousness of the people who are the &#8220;French Republic&#8221;, racial notions don&rsquo;t exist, then the concept of that same French Republic cannot exist in the minds of people who are aware of themselves as having a racial identity. </p>
<p>For them, France can never be a vehicle for expressing their particular, group aspirations because France doesn&rsquo;t deign to acknowledge their existence. To acknowledge the authority of the French Republic is simultaneously to eliminate themselves as a unique, cultural entity.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder then that these people would be frustrated with their role in the French Republic? And should we be surprised to find that they publicly riot to give vent their frustration in the form of street demonstrations, acts of vandalism and anti French-authority riots?</p>

<p>I do not know how these problems will be resolved. I do not think it will be pretty. I doubt the human species will become extinct. If the human population crashes the most intelligent humans will survive and reproduce. Human evolution will continue in the direction of higher intelligence. </p>
<p>Higher IQ&rsquo;s require larger brains. This makes childbirth more difficult. That is the only factor that can interfere with the evolution toward higher intelligence.

<p>Only a person who has never been in an area where law and order collapses could think such a thing. Intelligence is always an advantage, I agree, but there are times when intelligence does not win the day. Have you ever seen a man pulled down and beaten to a pulp by a group of thugs? Did Archimedes high intellect save him when he told the Roman soldier, &#8220;Do not disturb my circles&#8221; ? I have been in a few fights and intelligence quickly yields to brute force and ruthless savagery. Yes you can think, quickly, and attempt to obtain some edge but it rapidly becomes instinct, reaction speed and force. When the Red Terror raged through Paris, Moscow, and the killing fields of Cambodia often intelligent cultivated men and women were destroyed by mobs of brute thugs. I am afraid you put too much value on intelligence. Since the dawn of cities intelligent civilized men have been protected by less intelligent but physically stronger men who recognize the value that clever men bring to a people.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-387224" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>#1) The problem with human population expansion is that it is not the brightest who are doing babies, within one race and between races: Expansion of the white population will (won&rsquo;t say would) eventually enable humans to conquer and populate other planets.<br/>
#2) Environment will be okay if #1 does go in the direction I want to foresee (more whites, less third world). Progress does create pollution in the first stages, but eventually whites are capable and willing to change their ways and fix things, if only for the future generations, but also for the plants and animals.<br/>
#3) White people did adjust to #3 and still can (even with the tries to dumb down the education system). Offer and demand, here too, all should be fine if #1 is reestablished like it should be, if we rekindle with our moral and evolutionary compass.</p>
<p>So in my opinion JohnEngelman, there is only one problem, #1. And the solution is racialism: Africa to Africans, Asia to Asians, South America to South Americans, Europe to Europeans, the (ex or not) Commonwealth to the European descendants (melting pot of Europeans) and North Amerindians. I think it can still be pretty to do, exchange and deportation of populations, it is better for health reasons and for diversity and peace. Only then can human evolution continue to higher intelligence and eventually to the survival of Earth life on other planets when the sun will die.</p>
<p>Higher IQs require larger brains and it is why whites due date is 40 weeks and blacks is later. If our brains get larger, we will just give birth earlier and we already do. I don&rsquo;t understand how larger brains could become impossible and trigger the complete collapse of civilization: beside the fact that right now we are dumbing ourselves so your alleged problem may be fading, let&rsquo;s foresee that #1 is rectified after the white bottleneck that is happening as we speak because of miscegenation and less birth numbers, then with smaller white population in each of their original white countries (and in the commonwealth), evolution may continue, through adaptation caused by natural selection or by the last development in technology and medicine, and that could be also bigger brains. And indeed for that we will need like Jesse James writes physically strong whites racialists who protected intellectually strong white racialists.</p>
<p>If I understand you well, it seems to me your last scenario was that if we don&rsquo;t become more intelligent (I presume you assume by mixing with North East Asians, isn&rsquo;t it?) then civilization will collapse and violence will take charge. I wish to know why you think we need to become more intelligent to be saved, aren&rsquo;t the leftists seemingly more intelligent and isn&rsquo;t their kind of intelligence that brought us to our current problems?</p>
<p>My scenario is that the white pathological altruists miscegenate or dwindle enough to allow the surviving white racialists to empower themselves back to white nations (well unless civil wars start earlier, if so then the means although more violent in a short term, should bring the same results, at least in Europe), then each race will be let to its own devices, that should put civilization right to its former glorious tracks, well the white one the least.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-400776" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Indians behave better than whites? You are generalizing. India has a high crime rate, and their rape statistics are almarmingly high. Generally speaking, they are very difficult to deal with (with some exceptions). An Indian family lives next to my brother. They are white collar professionals, but border-line psychotic. They are extremely confrontational for any trivial issue. Their kids are out of control and they bully my niece. Indians commonly don&rsquo;t control their children. If you even offer mild critcism, they scream racism. This is no exception. A friend of mine from Thailand (yes, I have Asian friends) has a similar report. They allow their children to run wild through the hotel, very badly behaved. If the staff even suggest that they control the kids, the Indians will lambast the staff with hateful comments and complain to upper management. The lower staff is ALWAYS blamed. You make many generalizations about Asian culture, but you don&rsquo;t have much to back it up with. Your comment that Indians behave better than whites is erroneous and extremely offensive.</p>

<p>This is from wikipedia: &#8220;Sources show that rape cases in India have doubled between 1990 and 2008.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 24,206 rape cases were reported in India in 2011, but experts agree that the number of unreported cases of sexual assault brings the total much higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their murder rate is only slightly lower than the U.S. Our statistics are high because of our minotories. If we were an all white country, India&rsquo;s murder rate would be higher than ours.</p>
<p>I agree that their average IQ&rsquo;s are higher than other minorities, and they have have a high average income. That says nothing about behavior and daily interaction with their very foreign culture. Do you interract with them on a daily basis? I doubt it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about Judaism, but, while Christianity has a definite beginning and end of TIME, this is not the same as a unitary view of history. Ecclesiastes 1:9 says </p>

there is nothing new under the sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>He is right in suggesting that the likes of Judy Butler is crazy. </p>
<p>His suggestion that Americans be &#8220;a bit more open to the rest of the world&#8221; strikes me as a bit of tripe, though. If anything, the country needs a fresh dose of what the left would call jingoism, just as white people need a heavy dose of racial self-awareness and self-interest.</p>

All it means is they agree that Muslims, Marxists, and Jews are a threat to their identity and have no place in Europe, that immigration is genocide and no one has the right to invade Europe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d rather support Nick Griffin, Tom Sulik, and Kevin McDonald. They understand that you can and MUST support whites as a people while respecting their identity and autonomy as a nation. How hard is that to understand? When someone supports anything that negatively affects whites you attack them until they&rsquo;re destroyed. White nationalism and white identity that is global but not globalist. It&rsquo;s really not that hard to figure out and this guy is supposed to be an intellectual.</p>

Try to know other countries and not just to visit them as tourists. As tourists you don&rsquo;t see much. You need to understand that throughout the world people can think differently. I don&rsquo;t say they are better or worse, but accept these differences, because a world of difference is a richer world. The wealth of the world is diversity &mdash; its genuine diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>He should replace America with &#8220;people in every country&#8221; should be more open to the world. One thing I find really annoying is this belief that somehow Americans are not open to the rest of the world or don&rsquo;t know about the rest of the world. As an American, I have traveled a lot and I get ignorant comments ALL the time about the USA. (I&rsquo;m from Texas and no, I&rsquo;m not related to JR Ewing and don&rsquo;t live on a ranch lol. ) People in every country are ignorant of most of the world. Americans are no worse than anyone else but we aren&rsquo;t as ignorant as most since we have so many foreigners living in the US thanks to our &#8220;wonderful immigration policies&#8221;. We don&rsquo;t have to leave home to get a lot of exposure to foreigners from the third world.</p>

You can travel across vast tracts of land in America with little if any cultural change, not true for rest of the world. Low population density, cultural homogeneity within makes the &#8216;average&rsquo; American more insular. All of this again is a direct fall out of the &#8216;young nation&rsquo; factor. The older America gets, the more old-world like it will become. You can see the same affect on insularity within America as well, between different regions just like between America and rest of the world. I would assume Australia should have a similar character for the same reasons, only more pronounced. Most cultural exposure Americans get is either through TV or due to high immigration in recent times. It&rsquo;s not an uncommon notion outside America that many Americans wouldn&rsquo;t know where most countries are located on the world map.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-386423" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Nice interview. Mr Benoist brings up a lot of interesting points. Not everything he says maybe spot on but lot of insight nonetheless. </p>
<p>Excessive obsession with Race and the complexity of identity:<br/>
While Amreners say that Blacks are obsessed with race, I see exactly the same thing here as well. &#8216;Race is everything&rsquo; kind of stand a lot of Amreners take is not very different from &#8216;Race doesn&rsquo;t exist&rsquo; stand that some others take and here&rsquo;s why I think so. Race, the way we understand, is basically a label for sets of genetic blue prints. While biologically a strong driver, psychologically not so much. Psychologically it plays a sub-conscious role largely, not a conscious one. Race becomes a conscious factor only in a multi-racial environment, even here not all the time. Emphasizing too much on a sub-conscious pattern won&rsquo;t yield much result. It is here that Amren&rsquo;s perspective is flawed IMO But their question to Mr Benoist seems to indicate they are aware of this somewhat. </p>
<p>Real world is all about Ethnicity, not so much about Race. Ethnicity is the more conscious part of human psychology and a strong part of identity. Race is an essential part of ethnic identity but there is a lot more going on there. This is exactly why racial solidarity of any kind (white, black, Asian) is generally a myth. The non-existence of racial solidarity is very clear from all the White wars of Europe, Mongoloids wars in Asia, Black violence in Africa. The Hispanic (funny word, his-panic ) solidarity you see is not a racial one. What race are Hispanics ?. Same goes for Jews. America is also in a bit of a unique situation in that there are pure distinct races cohabiting, which is rarely the case in most other places world-wide.</p>
<p>Sometimes even ethnicity takes a back seat over purely cultural/political identity like &#8216;American&rsquo;, &#8216;Indian&rsquo;, &#8216;Brazilian&rsquo;, &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo;. Of course there are those for whom race is everything. But is this the situation with majority of people ? Nope. Exceptions only prove the rule.</p>

This has been thoroughly documented. You do confirm that an affection/obsession with non-whites inhibits you from evaluating whites according to the same standards, let alone having any sympathy for the naivity in which they time and time again have allowed themselves to be taken advantage of. All Western anti-semitism started as a response to clear ethnocentric inspired nepotism on account of the Jews, and unfortunately this is becoming the case once more. </p>
<p>I note &gt; You are able to assign negative traits to whites as a group, while never allowing any criticism of Asians/Jews as a group. You simply follow in the footsteps of Marcuse and other, mostly Jewish pseudo intellectuals who got us in this mess.</p>

<p>This is nonsensical. The system may be destroying identities everywhere, but it is not demographically erasing Muslims, Mexicans, Africans or Asians.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-386875" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I can sum up this guy in one paragraph. No one knows who he is because he is nobody. He is very bitter because he is a nobody. He has built up a complex model of why the world sucks almost devoid of any real experience or reasonable examination of anyone elses experiences. Because of this, his model is completely worthless in gaining power over anything whatsoever so he is now both bitter and impotent. Any attempt to suggest observation of what is going on now or what has happened as a pattern in history, let alone suggest ways to use that knowledge to be anything other than bitter and impotent, is treated with contempt. Nothing comes from this way of thinking, certainly nothing in the way of solutions.</p>
<p>A word of advice. Ignore guys like this. Do the exact opposite of what he is doing. Admit there is alot going on you have no clue about and never could because it is far outside your scope and influence. Focus instead on common sense and what is, in fact within your own scope and influence. What can YOU do, right now, today, this minute to address the situation as you know it.</p>
<p>Examples.</p>
<p>You see on the news that black violence among whites is exploding. Blacks feel it is OK to openly attack whites and treat it as a game. What can you do?</p>
<p>Well, if you live in the US, you can buy a gun, right now. Get a concealed carry permit. Train in how to use that gun to effectively kill. And, if, God forbid, some scumbag decides you are a nice target for the &#8220;knockout game&#8221;, you can kill him. If the laws where you live don&rsquo;t allow this, you can move. And no&hellip;there is not a single place in the US where other factors make living in a bad place where self-defense is illegal, something to be desired. Quite the opposite. Liberal bastions are currently experiencing the second Great Depression. The Obama Depression. All other parts of the US have jobs. So move.</p>
<p>No&hellip;you will not know what effect this has on the greater scope of the problem. It will likely take the hindsight of a hundred years or more for historians to document the cultural/racial impact of your decision to not lie down and die in the face of another races&rsquo; violence. Any conjecture about it is likely fruitless (or more probably an intentional red herring to distract from taking action today rooted in common sense). But YOU personally will experience the advantages. Others who flap their gums (like de Benoist) will, instead, increasingly be the victims of muslim violence in their own country and endlessly debate increasingly unlikely scenarios based on unobservable events. That is&hellip;..unwise. YOU personally, can do better. If by no other way than by simply hanging out and living near other people with a common sense, action oriented model of the world.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-386946" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
But in the history of Europe you have two competing models. One is the nation-state, of which France is the perfect example, but of which England and Spain are also examples.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Nation&rsquo;s etymological root is &#8216;Nascere&rsquo; to be born. But being born has nothing to do with the state and everything to do with the genes. If France will not be an ethnically homogenous nation, she cannot be a functional nation state because genetic algorithms create societies. Societies do not create racial constructs.</p>
<p>Further to this, as is typical for the French, he claims to believe in egality, liberty and brotherhood yet he excludes those pathetic barbarian Spanish and English (who had Latinized culture when the French were mere brawling tribal ruffians, occasionally butchered by the likes of Julius Caesar and Charlemagne to keep them from causing too much trouble). If he truly believed in affinity as a means of identity divisions, in a unified Europe, he would look at the -kinds- of societies that each group has created and use these similarities to define cladistics groups of social relevance.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s just an effete snob selling the superiority of nose-high French vision.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The other model is empire: Italy, Germany and so on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Italy has known Empire and suffered _exactly_ the consequences as America now sets itself &#8216;bread and circuses&rsquo; up for, by refusing loyalty to the _nation_ of the Roman culture and instead &#8216;outsourcing&rsquo; economic dependence to the likes of Egypt and Libya (grain) Spain (Metals and Pottery) and so on.</p>
<p>OTOH, until fairly recently in history, Germany was a land of warring principalities constantly striving amongst themselves when they were not being overrun by predatory Franco-Austrian and Russo-Polish &#8216;interests&rsquo;. Frederick The Great was the German Arthur, constantly running from battle to battle, to keep his people from being completely pillaged on a seasonal warfare basis which let these &#8216;civilized&rsquo; nations vent their frustrated lethal urges on some unimportant population &#8216;off to the East&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Yet when Germany finally rose from the bloodiness of a constant beatings, they were among the first to emancipate women, mandate education for all and make corporal punishment, especially amongst the military classes, illegal.</p>
<p>Did Germany seek Empire? No. It had &#8216;Empire&rsquo; (as sovereignty of ethno-identity protected statehood) _thrust upon it_. Indeed, it was the _Colonial Powers_, terrified of a bootstrap German economy and particularly chemical industry (having severe shortfalls in 18 of 26 major strategic materials resources, they had to &#8216;invent equivalents&rsquo;), that caused them to prevent Germany from having her own colonies, in Africa and elsewhere, while outright thievery of patented processes by the likes of the &#8216;great&rsquo; French and British multiculturalists basically started WWI.</p>
<p>Please, the man has no concept of what he speaks.</p>
<p>Thinking too much about the value of others is what defeats self-identity you twit. </p>
<p>Refusing to acknowledge the value of history as defining the present day attitudes and who is better or worse for want of having them is speaking to your navel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
I think the model of empire is much better because it does not concentrate power. It leaves rights and political autonomy to the different countries and regions. A recent model would be the Austro-Hungarian empire. It contained 35 different nationalities, but it worked pretty well. Of course, it was implicated in all the troubles in the Balkans.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Unless you were one of the subject white peoples whom the Austrians looked down upon as &#8216;not from here&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The problem with Europe is that they think &#8216;autonomous regional&rsquo; self-determinism doesn&rsquo;t result in severe cultural insularism. It never fails to amaze me someone can claim both Wilsonianism and Isolationism of the Americans who have a _stable continental land mass_ while claiming to be &#8216;more worldly&rsquo; because they haven&rsquo;t tried to butch or overrun any other civilized country, recently.</p>
<p>Get a clue, buy a vowel: You have no identity politics beyond &#8220;I am not an outsider!&#8221; because you continue to live in the vestigial remnants of _city states_ whose social construct was that of DEFENSE against the common identity of a shared genetic algorithm which built **similar** social constructs.</p>
<p>Americans, at least while we were white and willing to butcher Indians who were not, had that common belief system in &#8216;just like us&rsquo; shared POTENTIAL for greatness and built a _Nation State_ because of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://necrometrics.com/pre1700a.htm#America" rel="nofollow">http://necrometrics.com/pre1700a.htm#America</a></p>
<p>Hitler, who was nowhere near as murderous as Americans were in our 19th century rite of passage, tried to help you folks along and you rejected him because it offended your spoiled brat sense of yourselves.</p>
<p>Except now you are not yourselves. You are the muddy remnants of a great people whose vaunted culture is vanishing before you because the imported dregs of the world haven&rsquo;t a clue how to make fine wine, cook decently, paint or write or compose music. And _their_ version of &#8216;French&rsquo; is whatever barbarian mudhut society their genes had constructed back at home.</p>
<p>You want to talk about identity and then you fail to recognize that genetics creates society, society doesn&rsquo;t create racial genetics. That single fallacy makes all his subsequent high-minded conclusions FALSE.</p>
<p>He says he is a theoretician and yet he refuses to look at numbers to create, expand or confirm his theories. He is a &#8216;dataist&rsquo; afraid of the knowledge he says he seeks from an expanded &#8216;world view&rsquo;.<br/>

It is a generally high income area which in the 1970s still had the characteristics of the great agricultural center it once was. Since then, it has become increasingly gentrified, but also is run by maddening nanny-state bourgeois feminist bureaucrats who are determined to wipe out every amenity, consideration and allowance which has a common man to live a normal life. Demographically, the black population is extremely small while the rest of the population is equally divided between East and South Asians, whites and gentrified HIspanics. The underclass is predominantly composed of less assimilated Hispanics, with rest composed the remnants of the white proletariat and lower strata immigrants from various backgrounds.</p>
<p>One thing that has not changed about Santa Clara County is that it&rsquo;s life remains highly isolated from that of the rest of the region and state.</p>
<p>The assimilated, economically successful elements live together very harmoniously, but the whites and Hispanics, also, are oblivious to the cultural imperialism they are being subject to engineered by the Maoist government. The Chinese who live there largely are not parties to this, exactly, and would not pursue it on their own. They, too, end up as object and tools in the imperialist thrust of the Maoist party. A small number are willing agents or actual advance colonists, however.</p>

He doesn&rsquo;t see that a group identity is vital and is as important to productive outcomes as is the performance of individuals on standardized tests. So while competition between individuals is essential and individuals need to be free from stifling group pressure to conform, without a mutual purpose a group of talented individuals is just an aggregate. People who cooperate in harmonious groups will outperform a random collection of equally talented but disparate individuals who have no sense of shared destiny or unity of purpose.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s ideal society is composed of complete strangers who are intelligent yet having nothing else in common. They could be fellow passengers on a plane or in a lifeboat who will only cooperate if faced with a common threat. Organic human societies do not evolve in this arbitrary, artificial manner. So beginning with a flawed model of human association he necessarily draws flawed conclusions. </p>
<p>He sees the pieces but does not see that they can only function effectively if organized under some overarching Whole.</p>

How on earth is an African immigrant a victim of this system? He is taken out of his world of abject poverty, disease and savagery and placed into a Europe of banks, hospitals, schools. roads, supermarkets, malls, electronics, indoor plumbing, computers and all the rest his own people could never think of creating. He is given every sort of amenity and advantage - housing, education, food, health care, transportation &hellip;etc. He is told his culture is superior to white culture (music, sports, food, dancing, humor, fashion).<br/>
I could go on but in no way is an African immigrant to Europe a victim. He is the ultimate beneficiary of globalism and multiracialism. And if he really misses Africa he can always go back and find it unspoiled by non-blacks.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-400842" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if you read my revised rebuttal, I kept finding more information in my research. Here is my response to India having a lower murder rate than the U.S. (3.5 versus 4.7): The &#8220;official&#8221; whites only murder rate in the US is 2.6 per 100,000&hellip;lower than India. This is actually a statistic that includes hispanics as &#8220;white&#8221;. The non-hispanic white rate is even lower. i.e., in mostly-white Vermont, the murder rate is 1.28 per 100,000 (2012). If you compare that number to your statstic about India, their murder rate is at least 36% higher than the US white murder rate. And by the way, the Vermont figure is not divided up by race. That is a total. The whites-only murder rate could actually be lower.</p>

Telling Americans they should get to know other cultures by living there, tourism not enough? Do I really need to live in Nairobi or Tunis to understand what goes on? Amren&rsquo;s articles recently are not hard hitting enough. American blacks are a very violent culture and cause problems everywhere they live. Should I go live on the south side of Chicago to get to know the culture there? Another egghead offering no solutions. Read Pierce. Alex</p>
