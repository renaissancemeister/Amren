<p class="articleSource">Marian Evans, American Renaissance, July 12, 2013</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
The continent sinks further into degeneracy.</div> 
</div> 



<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Paul Theroux, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Train-Zona-Verde/dp/061883933X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373639903&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=last+train+to+zona+verde"><em>The Last Train to Zona Verde: My Ultimate African Safari</em></a>,Â Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013, $27.00, 353 pp.</b></p>
<p>The last time AR readers met Paul Theroux he was traveling south across the eastern part of African continent from Cairo to Cape Town. His journey was by land, sometimes by boat, never by plane. He told the story in <a href="/ar/2003/12/index.html#article1"><i>Dark Star Safari</i></a>. Since then, he has traveled across Asia and Russia, a journey he recounted in <i>Ghost Train to the Eastern Star</i> (2008). For his latest, and probably his last long journey, he decided to see the other half of Africa. He would start in Cape Town and travel north along the Atlantic side of Africa all the way to the Sahara Desert. As in all his previous journeys, he would travel alone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Train-Zona-Verde/dp/061883933X"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-104883" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/LastTrain.jpg" alt="LastTrain" width="331" height="500" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/LastTrain.jpg 331w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/LastTrain-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px"/></a></p>
<p>In South Africa, Mr. Theroux spent his evenings in the green and comfortable Cape, with its northern Mediterranean climate, and his days touring the nearby black townships in the hot interior. While he found some black middle-class enclaves &mdash; well-kept houses and new schools &mdash; he found them surrounded by squatter camps stretching seemingly forever and constantly growing:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was no end to this township: the hostels led to the shacks, the shacks to the hovels, the hovels to the roadside and the bungalows, and beyond the bungalows and shebeens were the newcomers in the twig and plastic lean-tos, straggling across the flatland.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>By &ldquo;bungalow&rdquo; he does not mean a cozy cottage, but a concrete rectangle. A &ldquo;shebeen&rdquo; is a primitive outdoor drinking place with a piece of plywood for a roof, cinder blocks for a wall, and empty barrels for a bar.</p>
<p>One day he had his driver take him to the grave of the American anti-Apartheid activist and social worker Amy Biehl, who was murdered there in 1993. Miss Biehl, who was only 26 years old, had driven a couple of black friends back to their home in the township, when she was spotted by young blacks, who dragged her from her car and beat her to death, despite the pleas of her friends. Mr. Theroux found that the monument has the following inscription:</p>
<p>Amy Biehl</p>
<p>26 April 1967-25 August 1993</p>
<p>Killed In An Act Of Political Violence</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux is outraged. &ldquo;What is &lsquo;an act of political violence&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asks his driver, whom Mr. Theroux knows only be his first name, Phaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those boys, they had a philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Africa for Africans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a philosophy. That&rsquo;s racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they were political.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they killed her because she was white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They thought she was a settler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phaks had previously told him that one of the slogans of the anti-apartheid movement had been &ldquo;One settler, one bullet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux, who is no apologist for apartheid or defender of white minority rule, explains that anti-white violence has continued since the black majority took power. He notes that since 1994, &ldquo;more than 3,000 white farmers have been murdered by black assassins.&rdquo; The killing is encouraged by a popular black demagogue named Julius Malema, whom Mr. Theroux describes as &ldquo;wealthy, dangerous, and vindictive.&rdquo; His signature song is &ldquo;Shoot the Boer.&rdquo; Mr. Theroux calls it &ldquo;perfect for a black South African politician on the make &mdash; tuneful, with few words, easy to remember, anti-white, and an incitement to murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux writes that other black South African politicians do not approve of Mr. Malema&rsquo;s racial rhetoric, and that in 2012 they expelled him from the African National Congress (ANC). They are also afraid of him, for Mr. Malema remains popular among the impoverished masses, and it is entirely possible he could rise to be leader of the country.</p>
<p>Most of Mr. Malema&rsquo;s supporters are young men without jobs. Mr. Theroux describes them:</p>
<blockquote><p>These disaffected people were the township toughs who stoned trains, hijacked cars, and terrorized neighborhoods with brazen robberies that sent crime statistics soaring. With an annual homicide rate of 32,000, and rapes amounting to 70,000, South Africa led the world in 2011 in reported rapes and murders.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result of this reign of terror, &ldquo;every substantial dwelling was surrounded by walls, every house a fortress.&rdquo; That is how people live today on the otherwise idyllic Cape.</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux visited Namibia, a country that used to be known as South West Africa, and was a German colony, <i>Deutsch-Sudwestafrika</i>, before The Great War. After that it was ruled by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate, but became independent in the early 1990s. Namibia is a large desert country &ldquo;twice the size of California&rdquo; with &ldquo;only two million people.&rdquo; The &ldquo;people came in every shade from white to black,&rdquo; with many Chinese, Afrikaners, and Germans. Forty thousand Germans live there all year around, and thousands more spend winter there. Mr. Theroux writes that the best part of Namibia, including the capital city of Windhoek and the pretty coastal village of Swakopmund, is clean, well-built, orderly, and safe: like Arizona, but with fewer people and lots of Germans.</p>
<p>Yet even here, there are nearby black townships and squatter camps, brimming with newcomers from destitute villages. Here Mr. Theroux finds the same shacks and shebeens as in South Africa, hears the same rap and hip-hop gangster music blasting from car radios and shacks, and sees Africans wearing the same discarded Western clothes and American baseball caps. Mr. Theroux sees rap as &ldquo;the howl of the underclass, the music of menace, of hostility, of aggression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Germans are under no illusions that their part of Angola will remain an oasis forever. &ldquo;I keep my passport,&rdquo; one German tells him. &ldquo;They do the same,&rdquo; he adds, referring to his countrymen. They know they may have to flee one day.</p>
<p>Continuing north into the blazing tropical sun, Mr. Theroux finds fewer whites, mainly isolated cattle ranchers and shopkeepers in small towns. Three thousand Germans and Afrikaners live behind high walls in the desert hamlet of Otjiwarongo, and just a few hundred live in Grootfontein. He meets a widowed and melancholy Afrikaner woman there with &ldquo;pale grey eyes,&rdquo; working at a grocery store. He seems to wonder &mdash; as do I &mdash; <i>what is she doing there</i>?</p>
<p>Africa can be a lonely place for whites:</p>
<blockquote><p>There had been trekkers from South Africa in this area for a century or more, and in the most remote pans and valleys of Namibia the graves of Boer trekkers bake in the sun. I was to see one cluster of seven tombstones in Etosha, northern Namibia, near an elephant wallow in the middle of nowhere, and another in Humpata, in south-central Angola.</p></blockquote>
<p>These Boers were part of the Dorsland Trek (&ldquo;Thirstland Trek&rdquo;) of the 1870s. It is a deeply melancholic thought: Northern Europeans dying so far from their ancestral homeland, on an alien continent, in the midst of an unforgiving desert.</p>
<p>Crossing into his third country, the former Portuguese colony of Angola, Theroux is berated by border officials and followed my menacing young men. Once across the border, he finds a desolate landscape: stumps of trees, burnt-out tanks, and no wildlife other than birds, because a 30-year civil war killed all the game. Still, &ldquo;even on the worst day in the African bush, the sky and the space offer relief.&rdquo; Not so in the nightmarish cities: &ldquo;Another city, another horror, more chaos &mdash; glary light, people crowding the roads, the stinking dust and diesel fumes, the children fighting, the women heavily laden, and no relief in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a small Angolan town, he was accosted by young loiterers. &ldquo;You!&rdquo; one of them yells. Mr. Theroux asks them what they want. &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; He tells them the USA. &ldquo;I want to go to America,&rdquo; the boy says. &ldquo;What will you do there?&rdquo; Mr. Theroux asks. &ldquo;I can do anything.&rdquo; Another boy joins in: &ldquo;And me, I want to go. For work and for enjoying.&rdquo; Mr. Theroux says that they can work in their own country, in the town or the capital city. &ldquo;There is no work here. There is nothing here.&rdquo; Then another boy says &ldquo;Give us money.&rdquo; Mr. Theroux notices that the group is beginning to surround him and says &ldquo;maybe tomorrow.&rdquo; The first boy says to his friends: &ldquo;He is a clever man. He is telling us lies. He is lying because he is fearing us.&rdquo; Mr. Theroux now realizes &ldquo;it had been a mistake to engage them in any sort of talk.&rdquo; He ends with, &ldquo;See you tomorrow,&rdquo; and walks away very quickly.</p>
<p>Not all African young people are like that. He meets many who call him &ldquo;sir&rdquo; and are respectful, but they are in school and usually wearing uniforms.</p>
<p>Angola&rsquo;s problem, Mr. Theroux decides, is not a lack of money or development aid, but too much of both. The government is a &ldquo;thieving tyranny&rdquo; that keeps virtually all the money it earns from foreign oil and mining companies. The difference between it and other African kleptocracies is only one of degree. In Africa, &ldquo;only foreigners seem to care about the welfare of Africans.&rdquo; He means whites, since the only other non-whites are the Chinese, and they are there only to make money. They care nothing about and do nothing for the black population &mdash; no Western sentimentality for them. It&rsquo;s the same with the Western corporations looting the place of its natural wealth. The foreign aid workers and development specialists think they care, but Mr. Theroux considers them self-absorbed fools, whose officious meddling only makes things worse, and further entrenches tyranny.</p>
<p>Angola has great potential. The country is rich in natural resources, especially oil, diamonds, and gold. It also has the &ldquo;hilly, cool, and fertile&rdquo; <i>Planalto</i>, or high plains, much of it over a mile above sea level. Yet, there is little or no farming. Village people are moving to the cities. Those with any education, Mr. Theroux finds, want to leave for the United States. There seems to be little hope for a continent whose best-educated people all want to flee.</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux does find one Angolan who is optimistic about the country and wants to stay: a white man of Portuguese descent named Rui da Camara e Sousa. His grandfather was governor of the colony early in the last century. Mr. Sousa is a developer who is profiting from the building boom in Luanda, the capital. Mr. Theroux finds his optimism hard to fathom. Even with the new construction, &ldquo;everything looked crooked or improvisational, with a vibration of doomsday looming.&rdquo; The slums were a horror, and &ldquo;the government was corrupt, predatory, tyrannical, unjust, and utterly uninterested in its people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sousa lived on the salubrious Restinga peninsula, near the coastal city of Lobito. I use the past tense because a few months after Theroux visited him, Mr. Sousa was murdered by intruders who stole &ldquo;a computer, a television, and a mobile phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux is an intrepid and resourceful traveler, who has completed, or nearly completed, all of his previous trips. Not this time. As he approached the northern border of Angola, formed by the Congo River, Mr. Theroux finally decided to abort his journey. First, his credit card had stopped working, and he was running out of cash. He learned later that someone had printed his name and credit card number on a duplicate card, and had run up $48,000 in charges.</p>
<p>Second, he realized that he would see only a variation on what he had already seen: a nightmare world of poisoned and ruined landscapes; impoverished, starving villages; and &ldquo;cities that were indistinguishable from one another in their squalor and decrepitude.&rdquo; Traveling any further, &ldquo;meant traveling into madness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Third, he decided that he had pushed his luck far enough. As a 70-year-old white man alone in Africa, he was a natural target for thieves and hustlers. There was simply no reason to tempt fate by going on.</p>
<p>He also kept remembering the words of another white Angolan. As they contemplated the reeking, swarming slums of Luanda, this man said, &ldquo;This is what the world will look like when it ends.&rdquo; With that doomsday vision seeming all too real, Mr. Theroux decided to head home.</p>
<p>I, too, conclude that the age of white wandering is over. I believe it is high time we return to our homelands and prepare to defend them.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-305539" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Articles like this do very little to advance the racialist cause. You can find virtually the same thing being said decades ago - with pitifully little impact.</p>
<p>The reason is this: yes, blacks and whites are different (duh), but focusing <i>solely</i> on the negatives can&rsquo;t help but give the impression one is just on the lookout for &#8220;reasons to hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact is that Africans have better reason to be optimistic about their future today than at any time post-independence. Jared Taylor wrote an article &#8220;Why Africa is poor&#8221; in 1992. In it he stated (from memory) that that was the 25th (or something like that) year in a row in which Africans had grown poorer - the implication being that now that whites have departed the scene one could expect little else from Africans. Well, what a turnaround since then. African economies, having junked the silly Marxism of the independence era, have been booming for well over a decade, and the vast majority of them are considerably better off today than they ever were under colonial rule. This cannot seriously be denied. </p>
<p>What obscures that picture of substantial improvement is the fact Africans were starting from such a low level of development. African economies could triple in size and yet still remain worlds poorer than developed countries. For example, going from $1500 per capita GDP to $4500 represents a tripling, yet that&rsquo;s still only a tenth part as wealthy as an America or a Sweden.</p>
<p>Money isn&rsquo;t everything, of course. If we were to travel back a hundred years, we&rsquo;d find western nations only as economically well off as today&rsquo;s most advanced African countries (aside from those with substantial white populations or with oil wealth, like S. Africa or Angola). Western countries in those days, however, were still greatly superior in terms of general civility, tidiness, legal systems, scientific achievement, and so on. </p>
<p>But to focus solely on the negative in Africa while seemingly excusing the negatives in white countries is to play favorites. One could easily paint a picture of destitution in white countries by focusing solely on welfare class whites, but that would be seriously misleading. It&rsquo;s less misleading in the case of Africa - there is more going wrong there - but it&rsquo;s only a matter of degree. Misleading is misleading. WNs will give this tendency a pass, but others cannot help but noticing - and resenting racialists for it.</p>

I never claimed Africans were 100% responsible for their advances. It goes to show, I think, how little &#8220;interference&#8221; (as some would see it) is required in order to set things going in the right direction.</p>
<p>As for aid/charity, Africa receives less than $30 billion annually. It may seen like a large sum, but it amounts to less than $40 per African per year. Whether you think aid is right or wrong, whether you think it should be increased or decreased (or gotten rid of completely), you have to admit tha in the larger scheme of things, it doesn&rsquo;t make a world of difference right now.</p>

<p>My claim here isn&rsquo;t that Africans themselves produced the advancements that some of them today enjoy. Going back to the point I made in my original post, I simply wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are a number of advancements Africans have experienced in recent years, and that more are very likely on the way. In other words, it&rsquo;s not all bad news, it&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom.</p>
<p>I think the fear in WN circles is that if someone says something nice about Africans, or even just something less than wholly condemnatory, it equates to an open call to invite Africans into your lives and become intimate with them. It&rsquo;s nothing of the sort.</p>

I&rsquo;m quite well versed in the quantitative economic history of the industrial age and I can assure you that leading African economies today very much do match the output of western nations back then. GDP measures economic output, not the content of that output nor anything else that is happening in a country. If a country produces $20,000 per capita of economic output and that output consists, say, solely of wheat, then as long as there are trading partners that will pay for it (since no one can domestically consume that much wheat) then the dollar value of the trade rightly counts as economic output. If I&rsquo;m being longwinded it&rsquo;s because I wish to correct the impression that I&rsquo;m suggesting African countries today are equivalent with European countries 150 years ago. I thought already avowed that they are not (and quite likely will never be) but I&rsquo;m saying it here once again to dispel any doubt.</p>

<p>South Africa was built by whites who dispossessed the Koi not the Zulu or Xhosa. The latter tribes came to Whites from the interior, attracted by rumors of our wealth. We used them poorly because they had no skills but their backs and set them aside in townships of their own to rule as they saw fit. It was their nature to devolve to crime and hopelessness because they knew no better and genetically never would.<br/>
Is our historical behavior in exploiting those who came seeking us somehow different from how others have acted before or since or is it the natural course of things that even among those of a nominal shared species identity, a level is found between those who can do and those who cannot?</p>
<p>Whites need resources. So do East Asians who largely use them to sell cheap consumer goods to whites. If Whites cease to demand so much of the world, the Chinese, who now have a powerful consumer culture of their own, will still step forward to take what they need and make an even greater (monopoly) profit from African resources in doing so.<br/>
Whites leaving ZA to black control thus does no good for the White global position.<br/>
Or the Black one.<br/>
Because the Chinese will take from us both.</p>
<p>Blacks are suffering from the Savannah Priniciple genetic outcomes of the horrific nature of a Continent that is 1/3rd desert, 1/10th jungle and 1/2 Savannah, fluctuating between.<br/>
Africa has always been this way as between the deluge and the drought comes the disease and the famine. With predators and population pressure following as a constant carrion war, close behind.<br/>
In these conditions, evolutionarily, it behooved blacks to select to breed faster than they died and this selection for rapid maturity as the sex hormones which brought on early pubescence has had (among other things) a very deleterious effect upon their intelligence and social functioning.</p>
<p>Yet it is true that discipline and skill does not always breed success and blacks, with no change in their -physical- environment, just crossed a billion souls three years ago and in 40 more will be at over 2.6 billion.<br/>
Indeed, blacks are the sole population group set to continue to increase both in rate of growth and total population numbers for the rest of the century, beating all avowed demographic promises by the socialists who assured us otherwise.<br/>
This is the black genome in success-overdrive, without natural population inhibitors, creating a socially unsustainable base condition utterly dependent upon continued resource sales to fund their own existence.<br/>
With final predicted black numbers between 4.2 and 5 billion in 2100, at a time when Whites will be just 4% of 14 billion humans (560 million) on this earth, it is _not_ &#8216;hate&rsquo; that drives us to take the full measure of a competing genetic algorithm as reproductive survival strategy.<br/>
But rather the nature of our superior conceptual intelligence in seeing the long view of things as futures we must weigh and calculate as others cannot or choose not to do. For that is -our- genetic algorithm.<br/>
I will not have you tell me that I am not allowed this wisdom when blacks are not inhibited at all in their competitive ability.<br/>
For while we are gifted as few other groups in our ability to worry about the future, we are not necessarily superior to them because we are &#8216;smarter&rsquo;.<br/>
No, indeed, what makes whites better as a people than any other population on this earth is the simple fact that having grown up on the Eurasian plateau after an accidental kindess that allowed us to escape, some 60,000 years ago, the prison of Africa.<br/>
We are now disciplined by the rule of cold.<br/>
Such that we do not outbreed our environment&rsquo;s carrying capacity. Nor do we accept and elevate stupidity for pities or popularities accommodation sake.<br/>
Thus we look upon an Africa whose population has an average IQ of only 70, ten points above what would be considered retarded among our people, whose black college students have an average IQ of 84, 3 points less than the black on the street in America.<br/>
And we view their lack of discipline with the jaundice of those who know that 50 years ago, we were one third of the planetary population and did not ask anyone for anything.<br/>
As forty years from today, they will be thirty percent of the population and will be no more able to stand on their own then than they are now.<br/>
And we understand that when the resources of Africa give out. When the first ten year drought as famine comes and does not leave. When the world cries for the blacks of Africa who are dying in numbers that dwarf all White Wars put together.<br/>
They will look to our lands and see empty space and fertile ground. As easy living.<br/>
And they will demand why we cannot share some of that when they have ruined, as locusts will ruin, what little spare capacity their own lands once offered them.<br/>
All things being equal, it took us 17,000 years to become who we are Mr. Silver. As recently as 1,650CE, there were noteable differences in the brain case imprints as skull morphology of who we were vs. what we are today.<br/>
There is not time nor resources for us to repeat that journey. Nor is there for space for breeding crazed Blacks, Asians and Hispanics to learn the discipline of cold as we have.<br/>
This is not hate. This is survival.<br/>
Just as it was survival for the Jews to cry wolf in WWI and to become victims in WWII. So that they too could have their own homeland.<br/>
We dare not ignore the implicit behavioral threats that the rest of the world, including blacks, pose to our future. As a culturally brilliant and distinct people who deserve a unique destiny. Separate from those who would demand we share everything.<br/>
And leave us nothing of our own.</p>

<p>Thank you for that. Reading your comment, though, I don&rsquo;t see that we&rsquo;re really in substantial disagreement at all. You didn&rsquo;t so much as challenge the factual basis of anything I said as go off on a different tangent - and made many points along the way that I would wholeheartedly agree with.</p>
<p>I would take issue with your demographic projections. I&rsquo;ve played around with a &#8220;demographic simulator&#8221; (I&rsquo;m sneering at it because it was so crude) and think 14 billion people less than 100 years from now requires some extreme assumptions, and certainly goes against recent trends. Yes, Africans are horrifically fertile, and no, nothing good can come of it, not for them nor for anyone else. Mercifully, however, their fertility is slowly but steadily reducing, and by mid-century many of them can reasonably be expected to have reached replacement level or dipped below. Demographic &#8220;momentum&#8221; will continue to expand their numbers for many years after, but the great bulk of expansion will have by then been accomplished.</p>
<p>That will leave us with between two and three billion Africans, vastly less developed than the rest of us, many of whom will want to live among us. It&rsquo;s setting up to be a problem of epic proportions. Yes, the lying leftist scum are to blame - by tying our hands and poisoning our minds - for much of the problems that will be created by this outflow but that is out of our control. What is in our control is how we respond. And to this end I can confidently assert the white man&rsquo;s great mistake has been to unite the races of the world against him. </p>
<p> The rest of the world has no real use for blacks, and as often as not non-black non-whites mutually despise each other, but fear of the world threatening &#8220;nazi&#8221; causes them to side with blacks and ignore or downplay the conflicts among themselves in order to beat off the &#8220;nazi&#8221; threat. With expanding numbers of Africans, this fear of the &#8220;nazi&#8221; will translate into a policy of &#8220;negrify thy neighbor,&#8221; as each people, in an effort to demonstrate their antiracist bona fides, tries to morally one-up the other. </p>
<p>Country A takes on board some black &#8220;refugees&#8221; and tries to morally one-up Country B by shaming country B into taking blacks too, and so on. Fundamentally, this is a &#8220;pro-black&#8221; global orientation, even if very few of the participants in the game actually care anything for blacks. </p>
<p>What whites need is a &#8220;pro-white&#8221; global orientation, in which people across the world take the &#8220;white side,&#8221; whether any of them actually cares about whites or not. The best reason they would have for doing this is that the pro-white orientation would enable them to keep blacks out of their countries and to &#8220;manage&#8221; (demographically and geographically) the blacks they might already happen to have. This would create a true win-win dynamic, and it&rsquo;s one in which the genuine social gains of the last fifty years - namely, vastly improved inter-ethnic/inter-group understanding and appreciation (far from perfect, but identifiable nonetheless) - does not have to be ditched and the world sunk into interminable conflict.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-306189" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I suggest you watch Vice Magazine&rsquo;s two videos on Africa. The first was in Liberia and the second in (I believe - without checking) Eastern Congo. Vice Magazine reaches a HUGE number of youths today. There is absolutely nothing &#8220;racial&#8221; in anything Vice has ever done and so it hits these kids squarely between the eyes and hopefully sparks something that says, &#8220;hey, that&rsquo;s exactly what I see in Detroit or Harlem or Liberty City or DC&#8221; and thereby unwinds 18 years of indoctrination. </p>
<p>Likewise, in terms of changing or deprogramming our youth, the NSA debacle where we now have proof the government really is spying on all of us all the time tells these same kids that government is NOT their friend. Look at the huge spike in numbers of young people embracing gun culture, opposing militarized police, etc. </p>
<p>The youth are our only hope. The children of the 20&rsquo;s-60&rsquo;s destroyed this nation and we must hope now the pendulum has begun to swing back. </p>

Nigeria, for example, has pumped over a trillion dollars of oil since 1965 but the country is a broken-down filthy crime-ridden corrupt shambles. The usual liberal excuse for this is Nigeria&rsquo;s huge population (150 million? nobody really knows) but tiny Equatorial Guinea (pop 500,000) has also had an oil bonanza with extraordinarily high (15% or more) growth rates for many years but the people (by all accounts) are still dirt poor. If it had been populated by whites or Asians (or even Arabs, god forbid) it would by now be just about the richest country (per capita) in the world. (currently Luxembourg hold this position, I think).</p>

That the new increase in wealth for a subset of Africans-even a significant percentage-has also increased per capita income to any degree that improves the lot of the average African is a ridiculous myth. In Africa, the rising tide doesn&rsquo;t lift all boats; it just lifts a few more boats without holes in them beyond the reach of the masses bailing out theirs. Chinese roads and power plants won&rsquo;t be delivering anything valuable or energizing any African industry, respectively, in the foreseeable future. </p>

When the time comes the blacks will openly and cowardly (as is their way) launch a Rwanda-type genocidal pogrom - but, although many whites will initially die (in horrible ways, because torture is a black fetish), once the whites organise themselves the blacks will be thoroughly thrashed and hopefully will be taught a lesson they won&rsquo;t soon forget. I just hope that they will adopt one, just one, piece of African culture - and that is to &#8220;take no prisoners..!&#8221;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-332086" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You know, I recall reading an article over at the Council of Conservative Citizens a while ago. Knowing that there has always been talk coming from the black population in South Africa about conducting a mass genocide against SA&rsquo;s whites once Nelson Mandela dies. Someone over at CofCC decided to ask many of America&rsquo;s Congressmen, Senators and other government officials. If this actually began to happen would they support the admittance of some of these white South Africans into America, to save them and their families from a Rwandan style mass murder.</p>
<p>As unbelievable as it sounds, most of these scum bags said NO, they wouldn&rsquo;t. And one of these answers as to why they would not support it that sticks in my mind the most. Was that they didn&rsquo;t want them, white South Africans, to import their racism to America. We need to wake up, cause the cards are stacked, the game is rigged and the table is tilted, white people are in the middle of a race war, and we&rsquo;re the only ones who don&rsquo;t know it.</p>

If it were whites or Chinese or Japanese singing about genocide, the world would be inflamed. But the powers that be regard the African as little more than a small child (and in intellect they are correct) so that this is seen as preschoolers singing &#8220;kill all the grownups&#8221;. Disturbing perhaps, darkly comical maybe, but not a serious concern.</p>
<p>The whites with real money and power live SO far removed from actual African behavior that they see only the childlike quality and not the overwhelming violence and chaos. Add to that the Peter Biehls of the world who enhance their social status by sacrificing their daughters to the Beast and you can see that all we do here is just futile venting of frustration that the world fails to see and address the obvious (to us).</p>
<p>The ONLY way this changes is when those with money and power are THEMSELVES directly and continuously threatened. Accepting that premise as true, how do we take the African to the Upper East Side, the Hamptons, Fairfax County, etc? </p>

<p>&#8220;The typical woolly-haired races have never invented a reasoned or reasonable theological system; discovered an alphabet; framed a grammatical language; nor made the least step in science or art. They have scarcely comprehended what they have learned; or retained a civilization taught them by contact with more refined nations, so soon as that contact had ceased. They have at no time formed great political states, nor commenced a self-evolving civilization.&#8221; - Hamilton Smith&rsquo;s Natural History of the Human Species, page 196. (1848)</p>
<p>&#8220;The White alone posses the intellectual and moral energy which creates that development of free government, industry, science, literature, and the arts, which we call civilization. The Black can neither originate, maintain nor comprehend civilization.&#8221; - Fisher&rsquo;s Laws of Race, as Connected with Slavery, page 10 -11 (1860)</p>

<p>You are however correct about the US being different as many dead Indians could attest - the same could be said of Australia as many dead aborigines could attest.</p>
<p>The problem with the Afrikaner is that being too Godfearing - he could not carry out this task of eliminating his enemy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I think you are correct with your prediction that he will be &#8216;consumed &#8216;!make sure it does not happen in your part of the world!</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-306380" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Wow, I must get this book. I have been an intrepid follower of Paul Theroux&rsquo;s travels since he wrote &#8220;The Great Railway Bazaar&#8221; in the early &rsquo;70&rsquo;s. I am surprised he would attempt a lone journey through W.Africa (much more dangerous than E.Africa) at his age (70) and am saddened (but not surprised) he aborted it because I would have loved to read his opinions of the Congo, Nigeria, Liberia, etc, etc. But, as he himself began to realise, he would have been lucky to survive. </p>
<p>The biggest issue I have with Paul Theroux, who otherwise seems to be a race realist and potential Amrener, is that when he arrived in Johannesburg near the end of his &#8220;Dark Star Safari&#8221; from Cairo to Cape Town - the first thing he did was to contact that white-hating witch Nadime Gordimer and go to her house and take tea with her. He also unfairly (and cowardly) lampooned a friendly Afrikaner he met, for his &#8220;racist opinions&#8221;.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-306476" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think Theroux is anything but a race realist. Witness the fact that he blames much of the squalor in Africa on do gooding NGO&rsquo;s, manned almost exclusively by whites. Theroux, in his twenties, worked in the Peace Corps in Africa. This was long before his breakthrough as a travel writer. Anyway, Africa for him as a young man was mainly about the intoxication of his escape from the constraints of middle class morality American mid-twentieth century style. I think Theroux, despite all his experience, still does not see the African disaster as in any way race based. I disagree with him profoundly. But, just as I can&rsquo;t understand his utter lack of race realism I also can&rsquo;t understand the courage, which in my mind equates to pure foolhardiness, behind his unprotected trips, first from Cairo to the Cape and then this last West Coast trip. In short, Theroux is a combination of spectacular courage, talent and industry, combined with a kind of unshakeable stupidity.</p>

<p>by the way this situation is not much different from many parts of Latin America. If mexican mestizos, for example, have an average IQ of 85 (although any random person in the street should have less) its only logical that pure blooded indians had around 75 (similar to blacks).</p>
<p>85 is an intermediate between Indian (75?) and white (100) so the the original mexicans were more alike to blacks than they are today (mestizos) so the epithet &#8220;border blacks&#8221; is not as inaccurate..</p>

Now, Africans can&rsquo;t wait to be in France, Spain, Italy, England, etc. What exactly are these people bringing into these countries? What trade do they offer? How will any EU country benefit from having a Somalian family that has 20+ family member and none of them can do anything?</p>

<p>That is one of the most beautiful endings to an essay I have ever read. I am moved. The problem of course is that our governments, especially that in the U.S., are the enemies of their own countries. That affirmative-action parasite currently defiling the White House is a perfect example of greed, treason, cowardice and simple stupidity. He is only the most obvious example. And let us not forget that one of the worst problems we face is a huge, malignant, Leftist bureaucracy that treats all productive Whites as their deadly enemies. Third-world savages are the foot soldiers of these insane, Leftist imbeciles.</p>
<p>To defend our countries we will first have to sort out the internal contradictions. None of this will be at all pleasant or easy, but I look forward to it. It could very well be our finest hour. There is a reason that White people ruled the world 100 years ago. That reason still exists.</p>
