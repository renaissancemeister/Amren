And the critics love it.</div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><i>Django Unchained</i> (2012), Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino, Starring Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, <strong>2 hours, 45 minutes.</strong></strong></p>
<p>American whites have long believed that the price of peace was just one more concession. If anything disabuses them of this naïve notion, the critical acclaim for Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s new black-revenge fantasy should do so.</p>
<p>In a December 8 appearance on &ldquo;Saturday Night Live,&rdquo; the lead actor, Jamie Foxx, explained what the movie is about:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s good to be black. Black is the new white. In my new movie, I play a slave. How black is that? I have to wear chains. How whack is that? I get free. I save my wife, and I kill all the white people in the movie. How great is that? And how black is that?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The crowd erupted in laughter, whooping, and applause.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QIVZtildZ4c" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>In 2009, Mr. Foxx apologized after calling Miley Cyrus, the pop singer, a &ldquo;little white bitch,&rdquo; but he has yet to apologize for telling us how much he enjoyed killing whites onscreen.</p>
<p>What this means is clear enough &mdash; whites are a problem that must be solved &mdash; but first I will turn to a different aspect of this film: it&rsquo;s falsification of the past.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Rewriting the Past</b></p>
<p>When I was in graduate school, a professor repeatedly complained about the Right&rsquo;s efforts to construct a &ldquo;usable past.&rdquo; Like most college professors, he was a leftist, and like all leftists, he practiced the very thing he condemned. His lectures were full of &ldquo;lessons&rdquo; about how the Republican Party&rsquo;s view of the American past was fantastical, while the Democratic Party&rsquo;s view of it &mdash; as racist, imperialist, sexist &mdash; was completely correct.</p>
<p><i>Django Unchained</i>&rsquo;s picture of the American past is as false and distorted as it is clearly &ldquo;usable&rdquo; for political purposes. Consider the implausible premise: a German bounty hunter in pre-Civil War Texas happens also to be an anti-slavery fanatic of the John Brown type. He needs the help of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), to identify two slave overseers &mdash; the Brittle brothers &mdash; who are wanted, &ldquo;dead or alive.&rdquo; The bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christopher Walz), prefers to bring them in dead.</p>
<div id="attachment_102737" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 599px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Pair-in-action.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-102737 " alt="Dr. Schulz and Django" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Pair-in-action.jpg" width="589" height="442"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Schultz and Django</p></div>
<p>Shultz finds Django among a gang of chained slaves being transported by two slave traders. He murders them, frees the slaves, and asks Django to help him find his quarry. After tracking and killing the Brittle brothers, the two strike a deal: If Django helps Schultz bounty-hunt through the winter, Schultz will help Django find and free his wife, who is a slave on a plantation in the Deep South.</p>
<p>One need not be an historian to see how fanciful all this is. First, by murdering the slave traders and freeing the slaves, Dr. Schultz would himself become a wanted man with a bounty on his head. The news of an armed and murderous abolitionist at large would bring out many posses determined to arrest this threat to private property and public order.</p>
<p>Second, how would a<i> slave</i> have acquired the skills (horsemanship, marksmanship, tracking, woodcraft) needed to be a bounty hunter? Schultz would have no reason to be partners with Django. He would be far more likely to sell him back into slavery after the black had helped him identify the two Brittle brothers. After all, Schultz is a<i> bounty hunter</i>.</p>
<p>After a winter of killing white people, Schultz and his protégé find Django&rsquo;s wife, Broomhilda, enslaved on a Mississippi plantation named Candieland, after the loathsome Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Broomhilda has been beaten for trying to escape and &mdash; it is strongly suggested &mdash; raped as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Tarantino&rsquo;s Candie is, as one reviewer put it, &ldquo;the embodiment of racist evil.&rdquo; He is a sadist, a kind of racist Marquis de Sade. He enjoys watching one of his aging slaves torn to death by a pack of ferocious dogs, but his favorite amusement is &ldquo;mandingo fighting,&rdquo; in which two slaves are tethered together by a rope and forced to fight to the death. We get to watch the graphic spectacle on screen.</p>
<div id="attachment_102716" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 618px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/CalvinCandie.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-102716" alt="" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/CalvinCandie.jpg" width="608" height="321"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Calvin J. Candie</p></div>
<p>To infiltrate the plantation, Schultz and Django pose as &ldquo;mandingo traders.&rdquo; They then kill all the whites.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;Fuck the facts&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>There was no &ldquo;mandingo fighting&rdquo; in the Old South, and slave owners did not dispatch old slaves by feeding them to their dogs, yet this matters not at all to Mr. Tarantino or most of the movie reviewers. They seem to regard these fabrications as serving the higher purpose of demonizing white people. Not all the reviewers are as direct as the <i>Rolling Stone&rsquo;s</i> Peter Travers who <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/django-unchained-20121213">says</a>, simply, &ldquo;Fuck the facts,&rdquo; but they all take a similar view. Simultaneously and contradictorily, they claim that the movie is really truthful after all. Not one reviewer I am aware of mentioned Mr. Foxx&rsquo;s remarks on &ldquo;Saturday Night Live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>USA Today&rsquo;s</i> Claudia Puig <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/12/23/django-unchained-review/1765197/">calls</a> Tarantino&rsquo;s &ldquo;reimagining of history&rdquo; &ldquo;dazzling, daring, gruesome, and astonishingly funny.&rdquo; She also believes it serves the worthy purpose of &ldquo;driv[ing] home the ugliness of racism.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tarantino has something serious to say about American culture, history, and race.&rdquo; She does not say what that &ldquo;something&rdquo; is, nor just what was so &ldquo;astonishingly funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>New York Times&rsquo;</i> A.O. Scott <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/movies/quentin-tarantinos-django-unchained-stars-jamie-foxx.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">calls</a> the movie &ldquo;brazenly irresponsible but also ethically serious,&rdquo; &ldquo;a wild and bloody live action cartoon,&rdquo; but &ldquo;also a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism.&rdquo; Clearly Mr. Scott likes having it both ways.</p>
<p><i>NPR&rsquo;s</i> Stephanie Zacharek <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/12/24/166898958/tarantinos-genius-unchained">calls</a> the movie an &ldquo;antibigotry neo-Spaghetti Western exploitation comedy.&rdquo; Murdering white people is great comedy. But the movie is also instructive in that it reminds us that &ldquo;old ideas of inferiority still linger.&rdquo; Miss Zacharek tells us that &ldquo;if it takes significant liberties with history . . . it also faces certain historical truths head-on.&rdquo; Like what? That the &ldquo;N-word&rdquo; used to be in widespread use, even in polite circles. She is wrong. &ldquo;Nigger&rdquo; was considered a crude word even in the Old South, and was not acceptable in polite company.</p>
<p>The <i>Washington Post&rsquo;s</i> Ann Hornaday writes, with no awareness of contradiction, of the film&rsquo;s &ldquo;admittedly exaggerated but brutally vivid truths.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sure, this is an outrageous distortion,&rdquo; she admits, but argues that the movie is no less a distortion than <i>Gone with the Wind</i>. As a historian, I know something about Southern plantation life, and I can assure readers that Margaret Mitchell&rsquo;s Tara, with all its romanticism, is far closer to the real thing than Tarantino&rsquo;s torture chamber.</p>
<div id="attachment_102715" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 618px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Tara.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-102715 " alt="Tara, the home from Gone with the Wind as depicted in the film of the same name." src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Tara.jpg" width="608" height="486"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tara, the home from <em>Gone with the Wind</em>, as depicted in the film of the same name.</p></div>
<p>In defense of <i>Django Unchained</i>&rsquo;s falsificaitons, Miss Hornaday goes on to call it &ldquo;far more prudent in its license taking&rdquo; than <i>Abraham Lincoln &mdash; Vampire Hunter</i>. <i>Abraham Lincoln &mdash; Vampire Hunter</i>? It is faint praise, indeed, to say a movie is more realistic than one in which the 16th President puts down a band of vampires who are trying to take over the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/VampireHunter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-102736" alt="VampireHunter" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/VampireHunter.jpg" width="595" height="456"/></a></p>
<p>The pseudo-right-wing <i>Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s</i> Joe Morgenstern <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323984704578205371996961476.html">showers</a> the film with florid adjectives, &ldquo;wildly extravagant, ferociously violent, ludicrously lurid and outrageously entertaining, yet also . . . very much about the pernicious lunacy of racism, and yes, slavery&rsquo;s singular horrors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One reviewer, Richard Corliss of <i>Time</i>, <a href="http://entertainment.time.com/2012/12/12/django-unchained-tarantino-frees-the-slaves/">mentions</a> Django&rsquo;s reply when Schultz ask him to be his partner: &ldquo;Kill white folks and they pay you for it? What&rsquo;s not to like?&rdquo; Mr. Corliss calls this &ldquo;a tantalizing question.&rdquo; Let us imagine a movie by Mel Gibson, say, in which someone is offered money to assassinate leftwing media types. Would he still think &ldquo;What&rsquo;s not to like?&rdquo; was a &ldquo;a tantalizing question?&rdquo; Or would he wail in print about the murderous hatreds of the American Right?</p>
<p>A few critics understood exactly what the movie is about &mdash; and loved it. Mike Lasalle of the <i>San Franciso Chronicle</i> titled his review &ldquo;Sweet Revenge,&rdquo; and <a href="http://www.chron.com/entertainment/movies/article/Tarantino-tackles-slavery-s-horrors-in-Django-4143844.php">exults</a> that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a place for violence onscreen, and this is the place.&rdquo; Claudia Puigg of <i>USA Today</i> tells us Mr. Tarantino &ldquo;offers an empowering alternate vision&rdquo; of American history. Empowering to whom? Blacks who hate whites. Richard Corliss of <i>Time</i> says that Tarantino &ldquo;frees a black man to take revenge for two centuries of racial humiliation.&rdquo; And A.O. Scott of the <i>New York Times</i> notes that Mr. Tarantino &ldquo;takes homicidal vengeance as the highest, if not the only, form of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Williams of the <i>St. Louis Post Dispatch</i> <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/movies/joe-williams/joe-williams-reviews-django/html_42492f2d-6dd6-5480-bf06-f2ada67c8817.html">has</a> the mildest view of &ldquo;the purpose&rdquo; of the movie: It is &ldquo;about cleansing the stain on the American soul.&rdquo; I thought we had already done that with over 600,000 almost exclusively white fatalities during the Civil War, Martin Luther King Day, Black History Month, a black president . . . but never mind.</p>
<p>Perhaps most irritating are people like the <i>Washington Post&rsquo;s</i> Ann Hornaday who say the movie is &ldquo;meaningfully engaging the history it&rsquo;s repurposing.&rdquo; First of all, &ldquo;repurposing&rdquo; history means creating a <i>usable</i> past. But it is certainly not &ldquo;engaging history.&rdquo; Mr. Tarantino&rsquo;s film is not about history and it is not about slavery. It is about <i>racial</i> <i>revenge</i>. That is its <i>only</i> subject, and the reviewers welcome it.</p>
<p>There had been some worry in movie industry circles that constant talk of &ldquo;niggers&rdquo; &mdash; someone reported that the word was used 110 times &mdash; would offend blacks and keep them out of theaters. Spike Lee urged a boycott.</p>
<p>But blacks are lapping up <i>Django</i>. According to <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/quentin-tarantinos-django-unchained-african-407582">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, 42 percent of the opening day audience was black, and since then 30 percent of the viewers have been black. As Steve Sailor has <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/audience-racial-demographics-for-django-unchained">noted</a>, a black posted a comment about the movie:</p>
<blockquote><p>While whites are busy getting offended on our behalf, they miss completely why we are going to see this film. It&rsquo;s a black man killing white people in masses. I will pay to see that every time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this film 3 times so far and am going again Saturday night. It&rsquo;s an awesome movie.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Awesome&rdquo; is another way of saying &ldquo;inspiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twitchy.com, which tracks twitter messages, found <a href="/">this sort of thing</a>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After watching Django, all I wanna do is shoot white people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still hype off Django. I&rsquo;m gonna kill some white people today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Django got me wanting to kill white people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Django made me wanna kill so many white people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tarantino appears to have gotten his wish. In a recent <a href="http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhM8t7b4a1L2d9058H">interview</a>, he said he made the movie because he wanted &#8220;to give black American males a western hero, give them a cool, folkloric hero that could actually be empowering and pay back blood for blood.&#8221; He seems to find no irony in the idea of a white director giving blacks a hero, nor any harm in encouraging revenge fantasies.</p>
<div id="attachment_102738" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 611px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Dead-White-Man.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-102738" alt="Dead White Man" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Dead-White-Man.jpg" width="601" height="443"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Django victim.</p></div>
<p>Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam <a href="/">said</a> he thought the movie was &#8220;preparation for race war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only one movie critic, Dana Stevens of <i>Slate</i>, expressed uneasiness about the film&rsquo;s &ldquo;unleashing of gleefully gory racial retribution:&rdquo; &ldquo;Tarantino&rsquo;s intent may have been to showcase the horrors of slavery, but there is something about his directorial delectation in all these acts of racial violence that left me not just physically but morally queasy.&rdquo; Miss Stevens is the only reviewer I&rsquo;ve read who appears to have a conscience.</p>
<p>Another reviewer with some reservations is the <i>New Yorker&rsquo;</i>s Anthony Lane who admits that he was &ldquo;disturbed by their [Tarantino's fans] yelps of triumphant laughter, at the screening I attended, as a white woman was blown away by Django&rsquo;s guns.&#8221; Mr. Lane does not mention the race of the viewers.</p>
<p>To the other reviewers, I have this to say: Whites have grievances too, not the least of which is being turned into a minority in our own country by trickery and coercion, forced racial busing, as well as non-white quotas, refugee resettlement, affirmative action for immigrants, blacklists of paleoconservatives, and 30 years of censorship of those who oppose the Left&rsquo;s anti-white policies. Two can play the game of revenge. Richard Corliss and A.O. Scott would do well to reflect on these things.</p>

War Texas happens also to be an anti-slavery fanatic of the John Brown<br/>

<p>Ironically, the largest cotton plantation in Texas antebellum used black slaves and was German-American-run, even though most German-Americans were opposed to slavery.</p>
<p>Another reason this premise in DU is implausible is because while most German-Americans were against slavery, they weren&rsquo;t against slavery because they <i>loved</i> blacks, they were against slavery because they <i>despised</i> blacks, and thought that any economic or social system that relied on them was doomed to fail. So why would German-Americans team up with blacks to kill other white people? When Krauts spilled out of the Pennsylvania Dutch Country southward into the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, they found that English settlers then Scots-Irish got there first and therefore got the better land, so the Krauts had to settle for less fertile hillside land. But, they made the most of it, and were surprisingly productive with it. Because of that, there came to be a strain of paranoia among the English-speaking land/slave owners that the Krauts would conspire with the blacks to kill them, the Krauts would take the land, then free the slaves. But there&rsquo;s no way the Krauts would have ever trusted a black any further than he could throw one, and certainly not to conspire against other white people.</p>

One thing is strange, and is an illustration of how stupid blacks are - looking forward to a race war they would lose. All the nonsense about killing white people en masse, and race wars   &mdash;   do they really think they have a chance? They are absolutely going to get wiped off the face of America in a real race war (dare one hope?) so what are they looking forward to? They can&rsquo;t organize a small bake sale without someone getting shot. It&rsquo;s not like they have the discipline and brains to become Leonidas and his 300 Spartans. (That is such a comical thought) Once it becomes clear to the present DENSE whites that blacks are targeting them for murder due specifically to the influence of Django they WILL react, even though they don&rsquo;t now. They find it hard to face that the constant rapes and murders of whites right now are part of a race war. I think that this movie might wake white people up and if it does, that is a small unintended blessing. Thanks Quentin, you scumbaggy traitor.</p>

It&rsquo;s really kind of sad to watch their herd mentality, then they turn around and act like we are the herd that can&rsquo;t think for ourselves.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-181873" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think I&rsquo;ve been to a movie theater to see a movie about 3 times in the last 8 or 9 years, so I am obviously not equipped to know for sure, but something tells me that the only white people who might be flocking to see this &#8220;hate-and-lets-kill-whitey flick&#8221; are the white Obama voters, who pretty much hate the fact that they were born white.</p>
<p>I think I can say with a certain degree of certainty, however, that no White man or woman who is even moderately racially aware would voluntarily put themselves into a movie theater auditorium, or anywhere else - where huge numbers of blacks would be likely to congregate. Even those whites who are too timid to admit to themselves, or to anyone else, that their survival instincts go on high alert whenever they are surrounded by blacks, will automatically begin to feel extremely uneasy in such environments.</p>
<p>After all, rich White liberals who are constantly boasting about how deeply they love blacks and other minorities always refuse to live in neighborhoods that are heavily infested with their minority pets,. right?</p>

Though my father wasn&rsquo;t particularly a race realist, we both came to these conclusions on our own due to the &#8216;diversity&rsquo; of Los Angeles. Watching a vibrant metropolis turn into a third world ghetto tends to do that. Thankfully I got out and fled north. My father is in the process of doing the same.</p>

<p>To quickly sum up, r vs K selection refers to survival and mating strategies. Bluntly, one group has its strategies based on resource scarcity (K selected), the other bases its strategies on resource over abundance (r selection)</p>
<p>Your typical r selected bunny rabbit focuses heavily on social dominance games, backstabbing, out grouping, etc. typical K selected focuses on independance, self reliance. I could go on, but look it up, its interesting.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is, one of the r selected strategies is to turn vars members of the group against themselves and then sit back and clean up after the carnage. Its not conscious, it just works out that way.</p>

<p>What do you have against blue collar workers? I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d dare be so dismissive of the minority blue collar workers, or call them stupid or trash, so why do it to whites? Nothing is more disgusting than a self-loathing white (I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re white) and I&rsquo;m sorry for you. That&rsquo;s probably why you hate racially aware, conservative whites, because we pity you and you cannot stand it. You think you&rsquo;re superior because you have a college degree (something any stupid person can buy nowadays) but deep down inside you know you are inferior. Hence the insults.

Much of their education, in fact, keeps them from seeing the world as it really is (e.g., modern liberalism). Having a lot of formal education is no guarantee that one will be wise, perceptive of life&rsquo;s deeper issues, and grounded in reality. Quite the contrary in far too many instances. </p>
<p>Moreover, many high-achieving white liberals have never had to live among blacks and the so-called &#8216;minorities&rsquo; they champion. If they did, it&rsquo;s likely their entire tune would change. It&rsquo;s easy to live in the safety of one&rsquo;s white, upper-class and gated community and pontificate on what should be done to &#8216;help those poor blacks.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s quite another when you are forced to live among them and be on your guard at every moment of the day.</p>

For example, based on intelligence and the wealth of nations, it is fair to argue that white societies outscore African ones, just like how Asians outscore whites. Thus it can be generalized that certain groups of people have excelled at a certain attribute whether physical or mental over others.</p>
<p>There have been numerous studies &amp; stats showing that liberal blue states in America have the highest IQ scores, whereas conservative red states possess the lowest IQ scores.</p>
<p>It is thus fair to state ( not just including most of our greatest scientists, thinkers, academicians, writers, artists, musicians, entertainment pioneers &amp; media moguls who just happen to be liberal) that liberals in general are smarter than conservatives. Also one only has to view Fox news ( a network filled with insane clowns who try to pass of as a news channel) or listen to any conservative talk show host or politician to see how incredibly stupid they sound!</p>

How many ordinary blacks has Mr. Gates encountered in his entire life? Has a Section 8 family ever moved in to his block? Has he ever had to call the police about some kind of TNB? Has he ever had to compete with blacks for a government job where they have an affirmative action program and all the HR staff are black? When was the last time he was groped by a black TSA &#8220;officer&#8221;? (Never, he has not been on a commercial flight since before the TSA existed probably.)</p>
<p>The only blacks he has ever met have been the top 1% brightest, most educated and most docile blacks in the world, who are presented to him by various organization seeking his money. I would think highly of blacks also if that&rsquo;s the only kind I&rsquo;d met.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-189662" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There was an article last year in Psychology Today, &ldquo;Why Liberals<br/>
Are More Intelligent than Conservatives,&rdquo; by Satoshi Kanazawa, an evolutionary biologist. The author starts off with his definition of<br/>
liberalism as a willingness to pay taxes for the welfare of genetically<br/>
unrelated groups &mdash; a tendency, he says, that conflicts with the behavior of all previous human cultures. He ends with the crudest Darwinian triumphalism: we liberals are smarter than you conservatives, we are genetically superior to you conservatives.<br/>
Here&rsquo;s a response to Kanazawa by psychologist Shawn Smith :<br/>
It happens like clockwork. Every few years, researchers contrive yet another study to prove that conservatives are mentally deficient…. </p>
<p>Dr. Kanazawa seems like a decent man, and it is admirable that he is unconstrained by the hypersensitivity of others. Unfortunately, he appears to have recklessly exacerbated a serious problem in the field of psychology: our transparent and irrational animosity toward conservatives. </p>
<p>Psychology, which is unquestionably dominated by liberals, has developed an ugly habit of falsely maligning the political right. Through respectable-looking &ldquo;research&rdquo; we sling mud with flawed data and tendentious methodology. These bogus studies build on each other to<br/>
create an inbred, incoherent body of literature that will be cited with<br/>
unquestioning faith by the next conservative-bashing researcher.</p>

<p>In American politics, it seems to have been turned upside down. So-called American liberals seem to want more government. They often are in favor of affirmative action not only for American Black people, but for all non-White immigrants living in the States (what happened to the concept of competition?). They quickly dismiss ideas and opinions contrary to their own as racism, ignorance, etc. And don&rsquo;t even get me started on the practices of Bill Gates and Microsoft!</p>
<p>Who are the real &#8220;liberals&#8221;, really? The term has been hijacked. Or in American politics, at least.</p>

<p>Strange. It seems that those high I.Q&rsquo;s come with a vice: self-destruction through a lack of common sense. Look at your Liberal ruled Metro areas! Riddled with every sort of crime imaginable. Albert Einstein was a plagiarist that has stood on the shoulders of European master minds far smarter than he. Nicola Tesla was far from a Liberal. His thoughts could only be classified as exclusively odd. Bill Gates was an inherent thief that used clever monopolization to force substandard products down everyones throat. He also supports border jumping amnesty and paved the way for corporate outsourcing. Steve Jobs was nothing more than a clever marketing tool that has stood on the shoulders of the technical geniuses that have pioneered his hardware and software. Few if any know the political beliefs of those working in dark rooms that have made Apple what it is today. Steve Jobs typed with two fingers and even I could school him on the use of OSX. He knew nothing of hardware engineering of software development. I give you Henry Ford and thousands upon thousands of other anti-semitic, planet changing White conservatives in place of your pseudo-intellectual Liberals. These LIberals you speak of were products of a Liberal education and media. Today, the institutions that created these Liberals are now producing the most brain-dead lemmings the planet has ever seen. California and New York educational institutions are a laughing stock.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-180600" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;According to The Hollywood Reporter, 42 percent of the opening day audience was black, and since then 30 percent of the viewers have been black&#8221;.</p>
<p>BLACKS WATCH MORE MOVIES THAN WHITES ANYHOW&hellip; IT&rsquo;S ONE OF THE REASONS THEY ARE CONSIDERED MORE INTO &#8220;INSTANT GRATIFICATION THAN WHITES&#8221;. BLACKS PROBABLY GO TO SEE ALL JAMIE FOXX MOVIES AND ALL MOVIES WITH A BLACK LEAD ACTOR AT THAT RATE. </p>
<p>Blacks are always way over-represented at the theater I go to, and sometimes they even go to see very &#8220;white&#8221; films, like even arthouse white films, especially if they are comedies. </p>
<p>Quentin Tarantino is so obviously gay. How can he not be gay the way he talks? Little bastard raised in a single parent home, he is the epitome of hipster metrosexualization of white men. </p>
<p>White liberals are really, really into this sick, sado-masochistic stuff. They also love to make America squirm, as do Blacks. They love the race stuff because it makes people &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; and they love to bash America. </p>
<p>But I used to be one, and yes, I used to say really far out things too, like &#8220;it&rsquo;s ok for blacks to get revenge on whites&#8221;- before I knew/experienced blacks and before I tasted their vengeance. </p>
<p>Sheltered white liberals, living out &#8220;fantasies&#8221; once again. Fantasies, pure fantasies. </p>
<p>&#8220;I have this to say: Whites have grievances too, not the least of which is being turned into a minority in our own country by trickery and coercion, forced racial busing, as well as non-white quotas, refugee resettlement, affirmative action for immigrants, blacklists of paleoconservatives, and 30 years of censorship of those who oppose the Left&rsquo;s anti-white policies. Two can play the game of revenge. Richard Corliss and A.O. Scott would do well to reflect on these things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;WHITES&#8221; BIGGEST GREIVANCE- BEING LUMPED IN TOGETHER AS WHITES. BEING BLAMED FOR SLAVERY WHEN 99% OF &#8220;WHITES&#8221; DIDN&rsquo;T OWNED SLAVES AND TENS OF MILLIONS MORE IMMIGRATED HERE AFTER IT WAS BANNED. BEING SOLELY ASSOCIATED WITH &#8220;RACISM&#8221;, &#8220;EVIL&#8221; AND &#8220;SLAVERY&#8221; WHEN IT GOES ON THE WORLD OVER&hellip;..</p>
<p>You left out those greivances&hellip; </p>
<p>Ridiculous most of us are even associated with slave-owners&hellip;..</p>

All three films I mentioned are mythological or non-historical. They are also devoid of Uruk Hai in their casting. Another of the many thousands of things that irk me about &#8220;diversity&#8221; is the insistence on &#8220;blacking up&#8221; a role that was clearly intended to be white or makes no sense. Like the &#8220;black&#8221; vulcan on Star Trek. The wise black in Shawshank Redemption, TV and film are replete with clumsily inserted black characters and white characters given over to black actors.</p>

Ethno-masochism is the result of the schools grooming white kids for sublimation by teaching them that whites are only oppressors of the brown/blacks. I had to re-educate my own children against the state schools conditioning: they had no idea that white culture/Western Culture was responsible for nearly every important scientific and technological advancement we enjoy today, as well as the ethical/legal basis for a racially diverse society. THey also understand that blacks are intellectually inferior to whites, and in their own state are basically illiterate hunter gatherers and have PROVEN incapable of even sustaining an advanced society, let alone create one.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-181083" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I respect AMREN&rsquo;s policy of maintaining a higher standard vis a vis the use of assorted Billingsgate on this site but I also understand your frustration. We as White Amercans have been degraded, marginalized and guilt tripped for the last 60 +years. Now we are fair game for violence from the simianoid community with the tacit approval of what masquerades as our &#8220;government&#8221;; aided and abetted by the movie industry whose standards cannot possible get any lower. Tarantino should be arrested for inciting to riot and violence. His motives are most likely financial since he&rsquo;s attracting an audience of individuals who are like very dangerous children who will react violently to any stimulus. (There was a movie called The Show that dealt with RAP. Blacks rioted and vandalized theaters in several cities while attacking the employees.) He has violated the First Amendment. He has literally shouted &#8220;fire&#8221; ( in all of its nuances) in a crowded theater. </p>
<p>Any Whites who patronize this abomination of a film deserve no sympathy for any consequences that they suffer while in the theater parking lot.</p>
<p>Imagine the outcry should a movie be made whose subject were the Knoxville murders where nothing is sanitized and in which the murderers are portrayed with total reality. I pray that nothing like that will come to pass since I can&rsquo;t imagine any White actor/actress who would agree to play the parts of the two victims. No doubt that perverted, sick bastards like Jamie Foxx, Kanye West, Samuel L. Jackson et. al. would have no problem playing murderous Blacks especially when the victims are White and when they&rsquo;re getting payed handsomely.</p>

I do wish more on the racialist right (because of a certain obsessiveness over Jews) would quit trying to conflate anything that sounds German with Jews.</p>
<p>This is fiction. Do you really think white-hating Taratino would make a Jewish villain? Come on, folks, not everything on earth has to do with Jews! This website&rsquo;s comments sections have really become fixated on Jews here lately even when the stories in question are on totally different topics. I think the level of discourse was higher on this site the way it used to be before so many of the Stormfronters came here.</p>

<p>Like him or hate the man, President Obama HAS made drastic changes : affordable health care for all citizens, bailing out GM ( America&rsquo;s most successful automobile giant, which thanks to the bail out has now emerged as a successful company making a whooping &gt; 10% annual profit), killing Osama bin Laden &amp; other terrorists which brings criminals to justice, a protectionist policy where more jobs return to America as opposed to outsourcing ( something that the rich fat cat conservative GOP excels at) and most of all winning over almost all his obstacles, despite fierce resistance from his detractors in the past 4 years. I look forward to see tha handsome, suave charming smile when he will be sworn in on Jan 21st 2012.<br/>
People like you who moan &amp; whine all day about folks more successful than themselves is one of the reasons I have stopped listening to conservative nut jobs on radio, be it lesser educated unqualified men like Glenn Beck, Alex Jones or even the morbidly obese whinny pig named Rush Limbaugh! I used vote Republican &amp; was home schooled by my white evangelical conservative parents, but life in college has opened my eyes.<br/>
I see many members of other racial groups who are better or as good as members of my race. I particularly seem to admire the high intelligence &amp; charm of some of my Asian &amp; Jewish friends. My boyfriend, by the way is a very intelligent, handsome &amp; humorous Asian Indian pre medical student. I love America because of her diversity! I have now learned to look past race &amp; religious association of people &amp; instead choose to look at the content of their persona. Now if you desire to detest people different from you, that is fine &amp; personally I am no one to stop you from believing what you seem to believe. But, don&rsquo;t you dare give others like me a moral justification for your odious beliefs!</p>
<p>Life is too short, stop being so bitter, instead, try &amp; adopt to change. Enjoy &amp; make the best of it.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-181331" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>As the hype around this movie builds, there is a rather large silent elephant in the room which the cinemaphiles refuse to speak of.<br/>
&#8216;Django&rsquo;, the vengeful black cowboy, is not an original idea. It is a rip-off of the &#8216;Ni**** Charlie&rsquo; Blaxploitation franchise of the 1970&#8242;s starring Fred Williamson.<br/>
The series prominently used the &#8216;N&rsquo; word in the movie titles: Boss NI***r, The Legend of Ni***r Charlie, The Soul of Ni***r Charlie. In the 1970&#8242;s, the &#8216;N&rsquo; word was impolite, but was not yet a taboo for whites.<br/>
It is a absurd that Tarantino gives no credit to his inspiration, and movie critics likewise play along.</p>

<p>Well, we certainly have enough material to make a 20 hour long movie nevermind a 2.5 hour long effort, based on factual events about Black-on-White race hate crime and not Marxist Liberal revisionist nonsense along with its savage manifestations across the whole of the planet, examples to be found, of course, in most of Canada, Europe, Zim and SA besides the U.S.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-180920" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>These type of troll remarks is part of the reason why I am increasingly avoiding the comments section of any American Renaissance article. </p>
<p>In my view, the comments section should be a community of like-minded people like any other partisan website. I suppose once in a rare while I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a thoughtful response from the other side, but not a cheap provocation. &#8220;Blender&#8221; has PLENTY of other left-wing sites to spew his views on. This is OUR space. That is what makes it a community.</p>
<p>Like other people have suggested in the past, perhaps there should be more editing on the part of the moderators to FILTER OUT trolls, third-rate comments and commentators, and the increasing infiltration of comments from agents of &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; &#8220;watchdog&#8221; groups. These agents often appear agreeable to a certain extent, then start making odd statements, splitting hairs, picking fights, and start to get defensive about comments concerning their co-religionists. Astute editing and filtering will decrease the quantity, but increase the quality of the comments section. The bad drives out the good. If standards continue to be lax, it will attract more poor quality commentators, trolls, and sleazy &#8220;watchdog&#8221; agents whose presence tends to drive away more thoughtful people who have something to say.</p>

<p>It is increasingly clear that the divisions that exist within this nation are so deep, so wide, and so irreversible - that we are heading for a cataclysmic sized breakup.</p>
<p>Therefore, we in the pro-White, White race realist, White Nationalist community must be ready to move when the window of opportunity presents itself - and make our White Ethnostate a reality.</p>
<p>This also means preparing ourselves emotionally, psychologically, spiritually, and intellectually. This preparation phase is especially important for Whites who have race mixers in their family or in their circle of friends. Get used to the idea that these racially disloyal individuals will not be permitted to take up residency within our exclusively White Ethnostate.</p>

<p>Tucker JohnEngelman•4 hours ago</p>
<p>I do not believe obscenities such as these kinds of virulently anti-white movies (or TV programs), which are financed, written, produced and heavily marketed and then vindictively showered with glowing praise by the hate filled aliens in Hollywood who share genes with John Engelman have any place in our society. </p>
<p>These kinds of movies are meant to do one thing - and that is to fan the flames of hatred and to incite murderous violence by blacks and other minorities against men, women, and children of White European descent.</p>
<p>I say it is past time to bring back the Hays committee and reinstitute and STRENGTHEN the old Hollywood Production Code - and let&rsquo;s make absolutely certain that not one position on that committee will ever be filled by anyone belonging to Mr. Engelman&rsquo;s tribe.</p>
<p>After all, the Fox is not a good candidate to keep an eye on the hen house.61</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-181349" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>We are already in the real world. As far as sharpening ourselves for combat with the right counter-arguments, that can be done by simply reading the excellent criticisms concerning our cultural, social, and political state of affairs that appear in so many AR articles. Jared Taylor especially cuts through so much absurd dogma in his writings. It&rsquo;s truly inspiring.</p>
<p>The last time someone complained about the comments section, I think it was a few months ago (no, it wasn&rsquo;t me), you offered the same vaccine/white blood cells argument if I recall correctly. My argument is that the bad drives out the good. Thoughtful people will be less inclined to bother to write up quality comments when they think the audience contains too many half-witted Stormfront types on one hand, or sleazebag agents employed by &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; or &#8220;watchdog&#8221; organizations on the other. The latter group of people are not impossible to detect. Eventually their odd stances or names or comments give themselves and their motives away. Please filter them out. If the comments section is too open and loose, standards will fall, and the bad people will drive the good ones away.</p>

That Whites will eventually rampage out of self-defense but it will be put across of course that they did it because they &#8220;are just inherently evil&#8221;. As for White &#8220;neo-nazis and klansmen&#8221;, there are probably not even 500 people combined in the whole USA but they are the most hyped by the liberal media. Sounds to me like someone doesn&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s up - that would be you. Also when you mention &#8220;terror campaign,&#8221; I would advise you to take a look at the USDOJ statistics on rape, assault, and murder. It would amaze you. But like most leftards, I&rsquo;m sure the truth is the last thing you&rsquo;re interested in because liberals know their is a chance they may be disabused of their fantasy and they don&rsquo;t want to take that chance. But I have a feeling, like the author of the article, that liberals and minorities should be concerned that the continuous poking might actually yield the results they will not like. I look forward to that and to the truth being out.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-181938" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Absolutely. The Left not only isn&rsquo;t interested in the truth, they are actually hostile to it. Everything the Left believes is a lie or false assumption. They are so far removed from reality that even when it&rsquo;s proved they are wrong, the Left just shrugs its collective shoulders and moves on to the next lie. A good example is the fraud of Global Warming. The Left was using that to impose its evil tyranny. Then when it was demonstrated that there had been no global warming since 1997, they moved on to the next lie which was &#8220;Climate Change.&#8221; Too many government-paid scientists have now been caught lying, and the science has proved to be junk. So now we don&rsquo;t hear that much about Global Warming any more. </p>
<p>But the Left still reaches out its greedy hand to grab more power and more of our money using other excuses. For instance ObamaCare has nothing to do with health care. Quite the opposite. ObamaCare is a tactic to destroy the health care system so the government will have an excuse to impose their own system; a system that will be staffed with affirmative-action parasites and which will dispense health care with the same brisk efficiency and concern for the patient as a typical DMV office staffed by corrupt nonWhite placeholders.</p>

Nevertheless, it is essential to sustain our counter-arguments to strengthen our own convictions and persuade the uncommitted, and also to weaken the less brainwashed leftists with a sense of shame about dishonesty.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-181732" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is true. They are not interested in facts. Like that free blacks owned slaves, that their own racial brethren sold them into slavery in Africa and without this, there would have never been black slavery in the Western hemisphere, and that regardless, there would still be slavery in black Africa. </p>
<p>The colonial powers (who in no way represented the best interests of the common White man on the street) would have been just as happy to totally rely on Indian slaves (if they had proven useful) or White indentured servants from the debtor class of Europe. Blacks were simply a readily available commodity because it was big business for the African chiefs, Arab and Jewish slave traders. As Rolling Stone stated though, F**K the facts. Facts are not important in the Black and anti-White, anti-American narrative. They want the narrative to be that evil Whites singularly went to Africa and brutally ripped poor innocent blacks from their happy mother continent because of evil White racism. You will even find one from time to time that will admit the realities of African slavery, but in the same context will try to excuse it and claim it was not an &#8220;institution&#8221; before Whites &#8220;persecuted blacks&#8221;. As if it matters to the slave if he is dragged off over a sea or to the next village to be treated as chattel. Or whether the difference in slavery consisting of being owned by a fellow &#8220;brother&#8221; or a &#8220;stranger&#8221;. Only someone with a slave masters mentality would think such distinctions were relevant. The modus is clear. People with that mentality are essentially saying, it is our business if we want to keep our brethren as slaves. I might want to own a slave myself and it would be right if I did it within my custom and culture, which is in and of itself ironically and institution. </p>
<p>Facts are not important. The narrative is what is important. It is all about singularly placing anti-White guilt onto useful idiot Whites, and promoting a sense of grievance into retribution into non-Whites and using that creation to hammer White people with anti-White power block. it is about hating, displacing and eventually committing genocide against White people. Blacks are readily open to hate Whites, not because of something that happened to their ancestors over 150 years, but because Black civilization exists on a rung lower than any other, and without any contact with any other cultures or races, would still exist on that lower rung. It is a way to explain the lack of &#8220;equality&#8221;, even after decades of affirmative action and preferential treatment. It is why the black historians feel the need to cabbage on to the myth of the fantastical black kingdoms of antiquity where all learning and knowledge originated and was stolen by wicked White devils. If you really are a black supremacist (as are the so-called black historians), then these little facts to the contrary that you are great kings and queens while Whites are cave monkeys, must be an incredibly painful thorn in the side that inspires much rage and resentment. </p>
<p>Farrakhan is right. Blacks are ready for a race war. They have been engaging in a low intensity race war for decades now and it has very little to do with slavery. White people will either wake up to the truth or they will be butchered en masse. This can only be held back so long before it explodes in a large flashpoint. We might already be seeing the first signs of the powder igniting with the black flash mobs.</p>

Well, sometimes he shows hints of really grokking race, but it&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s no white nationalist or ethnonationalist of any sort. Things would get a lot more clear in his eyes if he would only start getting race.</p>
<p>Which is why it&rsquo;s such a mystery to me that the Chicago based blogger formerly known as Detective Shaved Long****, now known as True News USA, called Alex Jones &#8220;the best show on talk radio.&#8221; Seems to me he should be more of a James Edwards guy.</p>

<p>Find out where Django Unchained is playing near where you live. Go to the theater in business hours, ask to talk to the manager. Introduce yourself as respected member of the community. Express your displeasure that the theater is showing extremely violent, hateful movies like Django Unchained that incites Black Americans to hate and want to murder White Americans, in this case White Southern Americans. Ask if the theater would show movies inciting people to hate/kill Muslims, Asians, Gays, Blacks. Also note that this terrible movie opened nationally on Christmas Day and is deeply offensive to Christian Americans. Get names, make the calls, make the e-mails. We have to stand up against the defamation of our people the same as other groups. Someone put up anti Muslim video on Youtube - very obscure and Muslim used group pressure, power to take it down and the American government apologized, pandered to Muslims. Please do not whine or try to find common cause with anti White Hollywood, pretend that if you aren&rsquo;t Southern never had a family member who owned a slave that this doesn&rsquo;t offend you. It&rsquo;s our people being defamed and threatened. Tarrantino and everyone else associated with this hate whitey, violent snuff film - they are enemies of our people and must be outed, marginalized.</p>

<p>Admittedly though, I do recall feeling a similar desire to do massive indiscriminate violence against another race after watching the cowardly primate at the end of &#8220;American History X&#8221; shooting the White kid who wasn&rsquo;t afraid of him &amp; his thug buddies.</p>

We have much more reason for taking revenge against Blacks for violence in which THEY personally and PRESENTLY are participating. Up to this point no Whites have taken up arms against Blacks however they with the support of the Progressive Cheerleaders are definitely pushing the envelope. Post racial period, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!! Imbecile Whites stupidly went to the polls and elected BHO in the hope that the Blacks would stop raping and murdering us. Well it didn&rsquo;t work did it? Then they stupidly went to the polls a SECOND TIME and voted for him still hoping that the Black would stop raping and murdering us. They really thought that the Blacks would be &#8220;touched&#8221; by our gesture. Well THEY WEREN.T WERE THEY!!!!!!!!!!???</p>
<p>If any Whites live in an area where there are no Blacks; in my wildest imagination I can&rsquo;t imagine were THAT would be, I suggest that you watch Hard Core Pawn. It&rsquo;s all filmed in a Pawn Shop in Detroit. If you&rsquo;ve never seen the worst side of the Black personality and their sense of entitlement, and their inability to comprehend logical reasoning, this is the show to watch. They come in the store with e.g, an outdated electrical appliance that has no power cord and they want to sell it for an absolutely ridiculous high price. When they don&rsquo;t get what they want they go totally nuts accompanied by a tirade of obscenities of course including their favorite one with the &#8220;maternal&#8221; prefix, until they are escorted out of the store by these gigantic &#8220;bouncers&#8221;.</p>

<p>It probably didn&rsquo;t really take $100m to make, and while the $109m revenue might be accurate at the moment, Columbia/Sony will find a way to nuance (lie) that figure as far down as possible. Mark me, before it&rsquo;s all over, DU will have &#8220;lost&#8221; money.</p>

<p>Jamie Foxx hates white people, but loves George Strait. (See attached video). Ironically, Strait has a fair amount of German ancestry in him. Surprisingly, a lot of (white) Texans do, strange for a state whose heritage is south-by-southwest. Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson sang a song called &#8220;Luckenback, Texas.&#8221; Luckenbach is German for &#8220;lucky brook.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foxx is also running around whining about how he was called the n-word and racially abused and taunted constantly as a young man. Yet, as you can see in this video, he wanted to get into a country music bar when he was 14 years old to see George Strait sing. That&rsquo;s funny behavior for a young man who was the constant victim of racial abuse, trying to get into a bar full of stereotypical white people who are thought to use anti-black racial slurs often and with ease.</p>

I was watching a Poirot film with David Suchet when all of the sudden a black was portrayed in a role a black would never have filled. I immediately turned it off and sent the movie back. I gave it a lower rating than others. British/Scottish films are better than Hollywood.</p>

He&rsquo;s down there with Michael Bay and George Lucas. Kill Bill was so impossibly stupid I think I lost about 20 IQ points after seeing it. &#8220;Did you think it was gonna be that easy? Yeah I kinda did.&#8221; OMG what brilliant dialogue. Hostel was unwatchable. Just rock bottom stuff.<br/>
I heard part of an recent interview Tarantino did on the radio and the guy asked him about the effects of violent movies on people and Tarantino just blew up at him and refused to answer the question. The interviewer asked why he wouldn&rsquo;t answer and he says &#8220;Cuz I&rsquo;m not a slave and you&rsquo;re not my master!&#8221; What a freakin moron! Sounds like something a middle school student would say.</p>

I doesn&rsquo;t need to be any more real than, say, Journey to the Center of the Earth or Total Recall. In Tarantino a twisted kind of good triumphs over twisted evil amid a landscape of psychological aberration, fantastic violence and extremes of relative morality. Maybe you could take Django as a fable or morality play, but don&rsquo;t expect it to be real.</p>
<p>You could also take it as just a cathartic violent movie, and not even give a thought to who was in it or what it was about.</p>

How about that mad black scientist Yakub who mistakenly invented White people 6,000 years ago. Also Bush blew up the levees in NOLA in preparation for Katrina. If Farrakhan had told them the Bush did it so that Katrina wouldn&rsquo;t trip over them I wonder if they would have accepted that.</p>

Thus, the praise for this film by such people is not surprising. What I find interesting and disturbing is the large white audience. I assume these would be brainwashed white youth who just have to see the latest cool movie or die. The logical followup would be to get their take on the morality of the movie, in particular whether blacks today are morally justified in randomly killing and torturing whites.<br/>
If the purpose of the film is to enrage blacks to deadly violence, the particular storyline would be unnecessary. The storyline as it stands appears to provide moral cover for black violence.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-181921" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The Left has always been enamored of the violent revenge of the loser. The Left tells losers; Blacks, Hispanics, social misfits, deviants, the lazy, the stupid, etc. that because they are losers it is not their fault; it is the fault of the winners. The Left&rsquo;s favorite winners/villains are Whites. I know, it&rsquo;s insane because most Leftist ideologues are White, but they consider themselves to be victims by some tortuous rationalization and therefore are entitled to lash out verbally or physically.</p>
<p>This victim mentality has permeated the mainstream since the 1950s and that is why we have so many misfits and losers going on mass killing sprees. The recent school massacre was directly caused by the Leftist message to losers that they have no responsibility for what they are and that the winners who oppress them deserve to die.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Lanza school shooting there has been a lot of embarrassing, overwrought posturing by the usual Leftist candle burners and finger pointers. Given the immoral and rather brutal nature of the Left, I would be tempted to think that they are striking false poses. Some might be. Their leaders perhaps. Certainly someone like Obama, who is quite comfortable with the Fast and Furious style of murder, wouldn&rsquo;t really feel anything at all except eagerness for an opportunity for crocodile tears and a power grab.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think most Leftists are knowingly striking false poses. As sanctimonious twits, they are doing something that makes them feel good and that&rsquo;s all it takes to validate, to themselves, whatever hogwash they care to project. If they like doing something, Leftists will always rationalize it so that they can present it as a morally-superior stance when really their rationalization is a lie. What they actually are doing is using the deaths of these kids as a weapon to attack their political and social enemies; Christian White people who insist on having the means to defend themselves from violent attack. </p>
<p>And, as we all know, most violent attacks against Whites are by lively, vibrant, diverse savages, so the Leftist twit is also striking a blow for our enemies by insisting that Whites disarm.</p>
<p>Because of one mad man, Leftists would persecute legal, responsible gun owners. This is another crime that the Leftists will have no problem rationalizing.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read, the Left is to blame for the shooting in several ways. The shooter was an extreme misfit. He was just the kind of loser that the Left has redefined into a transcendently superior being: (Alienated, sullen, afraid, resentful).</p>
<p>These losers and misfits are told all their lives that the winners are to blame for their own misery. That they are losers is not even a little bit their fault.</p>
<p>They are taught by the Left and its ally, the entertainment/media industry, that to lash out at their perceived oppressors is heroic and fine. What this Lanza was doing was probably just what it appears to be. He was killing his mother (she&rsquo;s to blame) and all the kids who used to laugh at him because THEY are to blame for his misery. The Left tells him so every day.</p>
<p>But whatever his personal motives, you will notice that ALL of these school shootings by Whites are done by the losers and misfits who are striking back just as the Left has told them to do. And even insane people are strongly influenced by what goes on around them.</p>
<p>And then the Left blames the winners among White people.</p>
<p>The Left also essentially ignores the daily massacres among nonWhite kids. It doesn&rsquo;t fit the Leftist narrative, so it is redefined as just a slightly high homicide rate among those who have been damaged by White racism. Another lie. Another rationalization.</p>

the mostly white audience, I assume.</p>
<p>Even without the racial angle, the fact that this movie with it&rsquo;s dehumanization of violence and third rate comic book level storytelling is praised by &#8216;critics&rsquo; as &#8216;brilliant&rsquo; shows just how low our culture has sunk -and its not done sinking, as we all know.</p>
<p>However, the left I think, is sensing their power is almost as absolute as it is in the big cities and their true nature is beginning to show. They don&rsquo;t want equality, they don&rsquo;t want harmony, they don&rsquo;t want a society where people can have different beliefs : they want revenge, even on people who never harmed them, they want to impose their views and wipe out others, they want to destroy any vestige of western civilization.</p>
<p>We all know that the left has been indifferent or in fact, supportive of the violence, mass murder and destruction wrought by communists, now they are on the brink of making the red terror a reality here. and they will. they will. </p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s rather easy to understand their push to disarm the populace.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-183461" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Modern Hollywood is writhing with movies that have an anti-white sentiment within, though before this movie we had ones like The Help, Remember The Titans, and last but certainly least Lincoln. Perhaps though this movie will herald a new generation of anti-white entertainment. It is quite possible that the future of this kind of &#8220;entertainment might become much blatant and violent towards whites. Instead of the overly sappy and melancholy movies about &#8220;White Bigotry&#8221; that all happen to use the same soundtrack and follow a laughably predictable and historically inaccurate plot. This will certainly not be the last we hear of this despicable genre of cinema.</p>

Hillary condemned the movie vehemently.</p>
<p>Maybe we Whites should have rioted and attacked the Black Caucus meeting room in DC and killed a few of the &#8220;Caucus members&#8221;. DO you think that Hillary or Chrissy Matthews would have called for the incarceration of Quentin Tarantino? Wouldn&rsquo;t Django have been an excuse or at the very least, a reason for outrage and violence in &#8220;The White Street&#8221;?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-183512" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Slavery, of course, was ancient when Columbus sailed. Most anthropologists trace slavery to the Neolithic Revolution. All agricultural societies had slavery - some more than others. Rome for example had more slavery than China. But both had the institution. </p>
<p>There were only a few who opposed slavery. The most important being - Wang Mang in Han China and Patrick in medieval Ireland. But Christ, Azura Mazda, Mohammad and Buddha accepted it as the natural order of things. It wasn&rsquo;t until white men in nineteenth century England (Quakers and Episcopalians) opposed slavery that it began to be seen as bad. Blacks in Africa and Amerindian tribes opposed the white man&rsquo;s attempts at abolishing this ancient way of organizing society.</p>
<p>No doubt a black man at the time would have enjoyed killing white people - just as they do today. But that probably has more to do with the MAOA-2R gene, or melanocortin synthesis than any revenge motive.</p>

To give him the title of Film Maker only tarnishes that title for the genius Hollywood craftsman of yesteryear. It&rsquo;s really unfortunate that Tarantino sold out to the Blacks only to line his pockets. He is reprehensible and hasn&rsquo;t a shred of moral character or integrity. He has sold out against his own race to launch a hate campaign which of course may work to ways: it will alert Whites that they are being targeted for animosity and it will help clearly define our underlying racial sentiments for Whites, Blacks, hispanics and even Asians. The pendulum may swing in the opposite direction. The problem is that we have an Anti-White leftist media who are nothing but amoral scum. The odds are against the silent majority, or should i say &#8216;silent minority&rsquo;?<br/>
Let&rsquo;s not forget that this vitriolic exercise in cinematic diarrhea was also backed financially by the equally reprehensible (Weinstein Brothers). I am suspicious that Tarantino, and many directors, are bribed or manipulated to create such films.<br/>
&#8220;Make this film the way we want you to or else your career is over.&#8221; That reminds of of poor James Caveziel who played Jesus Christ in &#8220;The Passion&#8221;. Since then his career hasn&rsquo;t rebounded and he has fallen into obscurity.</p>
