<div class="intro-paragraph">
Conflict is inherent; tragedy is frequent.</div> 
</div> 


<p>I would like to thank Professor Hoppe for inviting me to speak. It&rsquo;s a pleasure and an honor to be before you today.</p>
<p>I have been asked to give you a history of American race relations in a half hour &mdash; not an easy thing to do. It would be easier to give you a history in a single word, and that word would be conflict. Conflict is the normal state of race relations anywhere in the world, and for reasons that I believe are deeply biological.</p>
<p>Humans have an exquisite sensitivity to differences between their group and other groups. Group conflict is as old as our species. Humans are prepared to fight each other for all kinds of reasons: ethnicity, language, nationality, religion, and even for political reasons, but of all the kinds of conflict, racial conflict is the most chronic and difficult to control, and that&rsquo;s because race is part of biology. It is immediately visible, and is usually an indicator of differences in behavior and culture and not just a difference in appearance.</p>
<p>Wherever you find people of more than one race trying to share the same territory, there is conflict.</p>
<p>American race relations in the Anglo-American sense began in 1607 with the founding of the Jamestown colony on the coast of Virginia. Jamestown is not only where American race relations begin, it is also a fascinating example of the inevitability of racial conflict.</p>
<p>The purpose of the colony was to find gold, but the intentions of the colonists towards the Indians were entirely benevolent. In fact, the English, aware of the Spanish reputation for brutality in the New World, consciously wanted to be different and better.</p>
<p>The English, moreover, had no preconceived notions of racial superiority, and saw the Indians &mdash; or &ldquo;naturals&rdquo; as they called them &mdash; as essentially no different from themselves. This was in direct contrast to their view of Moors or black Africans whom they did think of as aliens. Some of the Jamestown colonists believed that the &ldquo;naturals&rdquo; really were white people whose skin was dark because they painted themselves so often.</p>
<p>In any case, the 100 or so men who started the colony were very careful to find a place for their encampment that was unclaimed and uninhabited. They wished to cause no offense. The leader of the colony, Edward-Maria Wingfield, decreed that since the English came in peace, there would be no fortifications and no training in arms.</p>
<p>There was contact with the Indians, mostly peaceful but sometimes tense, and before the encampment was two weeks old, hundreds of Indians attacked the camp in an attempt to wipe out the colony. There were deaths on both sides, and the English would have been massacred if they had not panicked the Indians with cannon fire. It was only after this narrow escape that the English built the three-sided stockade so familiar to American school children.</p>
<p>The colony went through very hard times, but survived. Despite that bad start before the walls went up, the English genuinely tried to have good relations with the Indians, but to their disappointment, it was the tribes who were closest to them who liked them the least and the ones furthest away who were friendly and willing to trade. This seems to be a general principle of race relations: they are better at a distance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much I can assume about this audience&rsquo;s knowledge of colonial history, but the chief of the neighboring Indians was named Powhatan, and his favorite daughter, Pocahontas, converted to Christianity and married the English planter John Rolfe. That was in 1614, and it inaugurated a period of real harmony. The new head of the colony, George Thorpe, was especially solicitous of the Indians, whom he genuinely tried to help. When English dogs barked at Indians, he had them publicly hanged.</p>
<div id="attachment_105911" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Baptism.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-105911" alt="The Baptism of Pocahontas, by John Gadsby Chapman (1840)" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Baptism.jpg" width="550" height="363"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>The Baptism of Pocahontas</em>, by John Gadsby Chapman (1840)</p></div>
<p>But four years after Pocahontas married John Rolfe, Chief Powhatan died, and his younger brother, Opchanacanough, became chief. Opchanacanough did not have a marriage alliance with the English, and he wanted to drive the invaders out. In 1622, four years after he became chief, Opchanacanough struck. By then there were about 1,200 English in the colony, spread out in several different locations. Every morning, Indians would come to work with the English on farms and in workshops, and on March 22, they were to all rise up and exterminate the colonists. The main settlement at Jamestown was warned, however, and the men kept their weapons handy and nothing happened, but in other areas there was complete surprise, and the Indians killed about 400 colonists. Interestingly, they were especially brutal to George Thorpe, who had hanged dogs that annoyed Indians and who had been so concerned about their welfare.</p>
<p>There was war on Opchanacanough, and reprisals, but the two groups returned to peaceful relations, just as before.</p>
<p>Amazingly, in 1644 &mdash; 22 years later &mdash; Opchanacanough launched an identical sneak attack, and this time managed to kill between 400 and 500 people in yet another attempt to exterminate the English. This time the English went on what amounted to their own extermination campaign, killing many Indians, including Opchanacanough. Two years later, in 1646, the Virginia General Assembly noted that the natives were &ldquo;so routed and dispersed that they are no longer a nation, and we now suffer only from robbery by a few starved outlaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we have what I would call the inherent tragedy of race relations. The English appear to have brought with them genuinely cooperative intentions. They were unaggressive and trusting and had no sense of racial superiority towards the Indians. This was in complete contrast to their feelings towards the first blacks who appeared in Jamestown in 1619, whom colonists considered alien and inferior. As we look back on the Jamestown colony, it seems as promising an effort to establish peaceful race relations as could be imagined for the times.</p>
<p>And yet the very presence of the English was an act of aggression. The Indians were there first. Someone is always there first. We may deplore the series of Pearl Harbors that Opchanacanough launched on the colonists, but that was the only way the Indians could have driven out the white man and remained masters in their own house. Those attacks failed and the Indians were destroyed.</p>
<p>And this is the story of the conquest of the continent. The intentions of whites &mdash; sometimes good, often bad &mdash; really did not matter. The fundamental fact is that one people had the land, and another, more advanced and powerful people wanted the land. The result was dispossession, and even now, despite a great deal of intermixing, Indians are a distinct people with a distinct identity that shows how difficult assimilation is across racial lines, even after 400 years. Race relations mean conflict.</p>
<div id="attachment_105910" style="width: 478px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Rushmore.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-105910" alt="Mount Rushmore was carved on land the Sioux consider sacred." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Rushmore.jpg" width="468" height="487"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mount Rushmore was carved on land the Sioux <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/rushmore-sioux/">consider sacred</a>.</p></div>
<p>It was just plain bad luck for the Indians that Columbus couldn&rsquo;t have waited 500 years. If Chris had showed up in 1992 rather than 1492, the whole hemisphere would have been declared a World Heritage Protection Area with perhaps a small amount of eco-tourism but certainly no colonization.</p>
<p>Let me now turn the vexed question of black slavery. I would emphasize, first of all, that it was a hugely varied institution. Most generalizations are likely to be wrong. The practice of slavery differed greatly from state to state, and the treatment of slaves varied enormously from owner to owner. Some states did not tolerate freed slaves and required that any freed slaves be expelled beyond the state&rsquo;s borders. Other states accepted freed slaves. Some states changed their laws back and forth.</p>
<p>Some masters were unquestionably cruel and drove their slaves very hard, but others treated them almost like family members. Jefferson Davis was a Mississippi planter who became president of the Confederate States of America. He had to leave his home to take up his post, and when he took leave of his slaves, he wept and they wept. His older brother Joseph Davis ran a plantation on which slaves were disciplined only on the recommendation of a council of older slaves.</p>
<p>You may not be aware of this, but there are more than 2,300 accounts by slaves themselves of what their lives were really like. These accounts are part of an oral history project from the 1930s. One of the reasons you don&rsquo;t hear very much about these narratives is that many former slaves show considerable nostalgia for slavery. I recall one in which a former slaves looks forward to meeting his master again in heaven where he can serve him &ldquo;just like in slavery days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Southerners often claimed that their treatment of slaves, whom they cared for from birth to old age, was better than the way Yankee capitalists treated the working class. At least in some cases, I&rsquo;m sure that was true.</p>
<p>Let me also touch briefly on the little-discussed question of black slave owners. Not all blacks in the South were slaves, and some free blacks owned slaves. According to the census of 1830, nearly 4,000 blacks were slave owners. In 1860, there were at least six blacks in Louisiana who owned 65 or more slaves, and the largest black slave owner had 152 slaves. This rivaled the largest holdings by whites, and I should point out that only about 20 percent of white households in the South owned any slaves at all.</p>
<p>Slavery described as a means of trying to control the conflict inherent to race relations, but its successes in that respect must be based on the naked threat of force.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to turn now to the abolition movement, which I think is one of the most misunderstood movements in American history. Most Americans today think the abolitionists wanted to free the slaves and make them equal to whites. Not at all. The huge majority wanted to free the slaves and send them out of the United States, in a process that they called colonization.</p>
<p>I assume you have heard of Harriet Beecher Stowe who wrote the great anti-slavery novel, <i>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</i>. Her brother, the famous Brooklyn preacher Henry Ward Beecher, had what was very much the majority view, and I quote: &ldquo;Do your duty first to the colored people here; educate them, Christianize them, and <i>then</i> colonize them.&rdquo;<a title="" href="http://file:///C:/Users/Apotheosis/Desktop/Bodrum%202013%20Edited.docx#_edn1">[i]</a> Most abolitionist activism therefore reflected a deep conviction that slavery was wrong, but it was coupled with a desire to expel the free blacks from the United States.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln is known as &ldquo;the great emancipator,&rdquo; and most Americans believe he wanted to make blacks equal to whites. Again, they are wrong. He, too, wanted to free the slaves and send them away. Like the other abolitionists, he did not want free blacks in the country. Why? He knew there would be conflict.</p>
<div id="attachment_105909" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/EmancipationMonument.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-105909" alt="The Emancipation Memorial in Washington, D.C." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/EmancipationMonument.jpg" width="550" height="397"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Emancipation Memorial in Washington, D.C.</p></div>
<p>In August 1862 &mdash; while the great American war was raging &mdash; he appointed James Mitchell as Commissioner of Emigration. Mitchell&rsquo;s job was to find a place for free blacks to go and to persuade them to go there. Mitchell also arranged the first visit of a black delegation to the White House on official business. It was a group of free black preachers, to whom Lincoln explained the war was being fought because of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and we are different races,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races.&rdquo; Lincoln went on: &ldquo;There is an unwillingness on the part of our people, harsh as it may be, for you free colored people to remain with us.&rdquo; He then told them he had in mind a colony for them in Central America, and asked them to go back to their congregations and preach emigration. In other words, the first time blacks were invited to the White House on official business was to be asked to leave the country.</p>
<p>I would add that what whites feared as much as conflict with free blacks was miscegenation. Of the 50 states, no fewer than 44 had laws prohibiting inter-racial marriage at some point in their history.<a title="" href="http://file:///C:/Users/Apotheosis/Desktop/Bodrum%202013%20Edited.docx#_edn2">[ii]</a> Massachusetts prohibited miscegenation from 1705 to 1843, but repealed the ban because most people thought legal prohibition was unnecessary. As the repeal act noted, inter-racial relations were &ldquo;evidence of vicious feeling, bad taste, and personal degradation,&rdquo; so there was no need for a law to prevent something so abhorrent.</p>
<p>Legal prohibitions against miscegenation lasted many years. In 1967, when the Supreme Court finally ruled anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional, 16 states still had them on the books.<a title="" href="http://file:///C:/Users/Apotheosis/Desktop/Bodrum%202013%20Edited.docx#_edn3">[iii]</a></p>
<p>Needless to say, racial conflict in America cannot be separated from bad behavior by whites. Lynching is often cited as a particularly vicious example. There has been a careful count of lynchings, and between 1882 and 1968, 4,743 people are known to have been lynched in the United States. However, of that number 1,297 &mdash; more than a quarter &mdash; were whites. There were actually a few cases of blacks lynching whites and, although it is not possible to know the truth in many cases, so far as anyone can tell, most people lynched had probably committed a crime. It was not a matter of just rounding up a black man to torture. Of course, there were false accusations, and mob hysteria. Most people think that the typical lynching was of a black man who was said, truthfully or not, to have raped a white woman, but only about 25 percent of lynching victims were accused of rape. The most frequent accusation (40 percent) was murder. Murder is almost never an imaginary crime. There is a body to prove it.</p>
<p>The worst form of racial conflict, however, is race riots, and the United States has had some bad ones. The first race riots were attacks by whites against blacks, usually set off by an actual or alleged crime by a black. Undoubtedly, the worst was the Tulsa riot of 1921. Whites simply attacked the black part of town &mdash; about 35 blocks &mdash; and burned it to the ground. No one knows how many blacks were killed. Some estimates are 30 to 40; others say as many as 300. Blacks fought back, however, and 10 whites are known to have been killed.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/TulsaRiot.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105906" alt="TulsaRiot" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/TulsaRiot.jpg" width="550" height="310"/></a></p>
<p>Another bad one was the 1906 riot in Atlanta in which an estimated 25 to 40 blacks were killed. I think it is fair to say that these riots, in which any available black was fair game, were an expression of outright hatred by whites of people they considered unalterably alien. We see similar acts today in the Hindu/Muslim mass killings in India and the Muslim/Christian massacres in Nigeria.</p>
<p>But the last riot of the traditional kind in which whites attacked blacks was in 1943, when whites went wild in Detroit and killed 25 blacks. Again, blacks fought back and killed 9 whites. Since that time &mdash; in other words, for the last 70 years &mdash; the meaning of &ldquo;race riot&rdquo; has changed and now means rioting by blacks &mdash; and sometimes by Hispanics.</p>
<p>In 1992, after police officers who beat a black man, Rodney King, were acquitted of criminal charges, there were riots in Los Angeles in which 53 people were killed. Of that number, only eight were white, but unlike the considerable number of blacks and Hispanics who died at the hands of police or in traffic accidents, all appear to have been killed by rioters, who were overwhelmingly black and Hispanic. There have been riots in Miami, Cincinnati, Cleveland, etc., in which blacks attacked whites. More recently, there have been what are called &ldquo;flash mobs,&rdquo; in which gangs of blacks suddenly descend on a white area to beat and rob people.</p>
<p>This is a very important shift. In the past, whites used to attack blacks, but now blacks attack whites. This has to do with an even more important shift, and that is the revolutionary change in the way whites think about race.</p>
<p>Until about the 1950s, this is what most white people believed:</p>
<p>They believed people of different races differed substantially in intelligence, temperament, and ability, and that was why different races built different kinds of societies. They wanted America to be populated by whites, and thought only people of European stock could maintain the civilization they valued. They considered immigration of non-whites a threat to their civilization. It was common to argue that if non-whites could not be removed from the country they should be separated socially and politically. Whites were also very strongly opposed to miscegenation, especially with blacks.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RaceMixing.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105912" alt="RaceMixing" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RaceMixing.jpg" width="550" height="365"/></a></p>
<p>What whites now think about race represents a complete reversal. I can think of very few examples in human history in which important attitudes have been completely turned inside out in so short a period. This is like Iran having an Islamic revolution or the Soviet Union ending Communism.</p>
<p>What whites are now supposed to believe I would summarize as follows: First, the races are absolutely equal in every respect and are therefore interchangeable. Race is therefore not a valid criterion for any purpose &mdash; except, perhaps, for redressing wrongs done to non-whites. Whites have no valid group interests, so it is illegitimate for them to organize as whites. Racial diversity is a wonderful thing in and of itself, so whites should welcome large numbers of non-whites into their neighborhoods, schools, institutions, and into the country as a whole. Immigration of non-whites strengthens the United States even as it reduces whites to a minority. As for miscegenation, we are not yet at the point where whites are actually criticized for marrying each other, but dating and marrying non-whites is thought to be wonderfully progressive.</p>
<p>Something else that is extremely important: Prohibitions against racial solidarity, against preferring one&rsquo;s own kind, against wanting one&rsquo;s numbers to increase &mdash; these prohibitions apply only to whites. All non-white groups take it for granted that they have collective interests that they must band together to promote, at the expense of whites, if need be.</p>
<p>Any white who is out of step, by the way, who expresses a preference for European civilization and the company of other whites, or who opposes the replacement of whites by non-whites is not merely wrong, but evil, and not fit for polite society. Every era has its unforgivable crimes, and for today&rsquo;s American whites, the one unforgivable crime is what is called &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let me illustrate this revolution in white thinking with a few quotations, all of them from presidents of the United States.</p>
<p>James Garfield wrote, &ldquo;[I have] a strong feeling of repugnance when I think of the negro being made our political equal and I would be glad if they could be colonized, sent to heaven, or got rid of in any decent way.&rdquo;<a title="" href="http://file:///C:/Users/Apotheosis/Desktop/Bodrum%202013%20Edited.docx#_edn4">[iv]</a></p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt blamed Southerners for bringing blacks to America and wrote, &ldquo;I have not been able to think out any solution to the terrible problem offered by the presence of the Negro on this continent . . . .&rdquo;<a title="" href="http://file:///C:/Users/Apotheosis/Desktop/Bodrum%202013%20Edited.docx#_edn5">[v]</a> As for Indian, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go so far as to think that the only good Indians are the dead Indians, but I believe nine out of ten are, and I shouldn&rsquo;t inquire too closely into the health of the tenth.&rdquo;<a title="" href="http://file:///C:/Users/Apotheosis/Desktop/Bodrum%202013%20Edited.docx#_edn6">[vi]</a></p>
<p>As recent a President as Harry Truman wrote: &ldquo;I am strongly of the opinion Negroes ought to be in Africa, yellow men in Asia and white men in Europe and America.&rdquo;<a title="" href="http://file:///C:/Users/Apotheosis/Desktop/Bodrum%202013%20Edited.docx#_edn7">[vii]</a> He referred to the support staff at the White House as &ldquo;an army of coons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us contrast these remarks with those of a more recent president, George W. Bush. In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina hit the city of New Orleans, a black rapper named Kanye West said that the federal response to the hurricane was too slow because New Orleans was heavily black and President Bush didn&rsquo;t care about black people.</p>
<p>In 2010, after he left office, Mr. Bush said that being accused of not caring about black people was the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/04/george-w-bush-kanye-west">worst moment</a> in his presidency. The worst moment! And this is a president who had some bad moments, alright. The September 11 attacks of 2001, for example. The most crushing economic slump since the Great Depression. A catastrophic war in Iraq that was launched for reasons that turned out to be completely false. And yet, for Mr. Bush, the worst moment in his eight years as president is being called a racist by some two-bit Negro entertainer.</p>
<div id="attachment_105913" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bush.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-105913" alt="George Bush surveys the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bush.jpg" width="550" height="378"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">George Bush surveys the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina.</p></div>
<p>This shows you just how terrified Americans have become of race. And this terror leaves whites trapped in an impossible &mdash; an intolerable &mdash; position. Take the assumption that all races are equal in every way. It&rsquo;s simply not true.</p>
<p>So what happens when the less intelligent groups &mdash; blacks and Hispanics &mdash; fail, as they inevitably do, to perform at the same level as whites? Because all races are officially equal, the failures of blacks and Hispanics must be due to one thing only: oppression by whites. White racism. Astonishingly, hardly any whites dispute this reasoning, and submit to humiliation and outright discrimination in the name of redress. Whites are thus punished for the failures of others, and taxed so that America can spend billions of dollars trying to eliminate gaps in achievement that cannot be eliminated.</p>
<p>This is so absurd, and so unfair to whites one can only wonder how they should have permitted it to become orthodoxy. You would think foolishness of this magnitude &mdash; and which is such a psychological burden on the majority population &mdash; would collapse under the weight of its own utter implausibility, but egalitarian doctrine shows no sign of diminishing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, whites have no moral or intellectual grounds on which to say, &ldquo;No, hold on a minute. I want my grandchildren to live in a nation with a European culture and a European people.&rdquo; To say such a thing is called &ldquo;hate mongering.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s blasphemy. As a consequence, whites have no way to stop their own dispossession through immigration and high non-white birth rates. American whites are expected to become a minority race by 2040, just 27 years from now, and the youngest whites are already a minority in their age group. By 2060, Hispanics will be the outright majority and whites will be only 30 percent of the population.</p>
<p>When whites parrot official orthodoxy and claim to believe that this transformation will be a real tonic for the country, I ask them to name just one majority non-white neighborhood they would like to live in, or just one majority non-white school they would like to have their children attend. Of course, they cannot name any. Whites show what they really think of diversity by having as little to do with it as possible, even as they pretend to cherish and adore it.</p>
<p>Demography is destiny. The United States once seemed to be solidly part of Western Civilization, but it is slowly being detached from that civilization. America&rsquo;s slow collapse into Third-World squalor will be a good thing for certain other countries. At the risk of only slight exaggeration, America&rsquo;s conception of foreign policy seems to be that if we invade a country and shoot enough people, the survivors will automatically become Jeffersonian democrats. Our capacity to do that kind of mischief will decline very quickly.</p>
<p>And yet, for someone like me, whose ancestors have lived in North America for 350 years, it is an unspeakably grievous thing to watch my country delude itself into self-destruction. I began this talk by saying that the history of race relations can be summed up in one word: conflict. I would conclude by summing it up with yet another single word: tragedy.</p>

<p>Which is why warfare is the dominant theme of any world or Western civilization/history textbook</p>
<p>&#8220;White race riots&#8221;</p>
<p>Another notable example close to the time of Tulsa is the East St. Louis riots of the summer of 1917. Largely white led, but mainly a result of pent-up white frustration over the crime and misbehavior of blacks who were starting to settle into ESL from the Deep South. As an aside, I don&rsquo;t think blacks were totally blameless re Tulsa. </p>
<p>&#8220;And yet, for Mr. Bush, the worst moment in his eight years as president is being called a racist by some two-bit Negro entertainer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably Jared Taylor&rsquo;s line of the year for 2013.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-352739" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Regarding &#8220;All men are created equal&#8221;, as Jared Taylor points out in his speech, any observer who is not deluded can easily see that no two men are created equal, so that statement cannot possibly mean what it has been interpreted to mean in modern times. Jefferson Davis and H.L. Mencken argued that Jefferson meant that no one is by birth given a right to rule another, which fits with the other and actually more important concept, that a just government derives its powers from the consent of the governed. However, I find that a bit of a strain, and I have read some statements that Jefferson might have actually thought that concept was true, in what I consider his tendency to be naïve and overly theoretical in his approach to life. Still, that&rsquo;s Jefferson, and not the slaveowners who also signed the DoI. I think the others, and perhaps Jefferson, were probably more</p>

People went to prison or lost their lofty positions when it was found out they had stolen money dedicated for their care, for instance. Agree regarding egalitarianism, as that had been peddled in Europe by Voltaire and company. The revolutions born from their ideas were quite a bit different from our own.</p>

The tribe does all this to our white countries and we sit around and vote getting use nowhere since the jewdical just overturns our vote.The sooner we stand up the better,people follow who they think are winners, white people are heads and tails over any other race yet we sit.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-353639" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yes, probably thousands of years ago the Inuits did displace a previous Amerindian population. I&rsquo;m not familiar with that ancient history. We know such conflict has gone on since the dawn of mankind. My point was that the Inuits, Yupiks, Aleuts were native to Alaska when the Whites arrived in our recent history. I don&rsquo;t know what may been thousands of years ago concerning the Europeans. I&rsquo;m not an archaeologist nor ancient historian. My point was an Inuit, Yupik, or Aleut would have been a much more appropriate choice to represent Alaska   &mdash;   if they had to have a minority   &mdash;   than an unattractive African, which makes no sense at all. This African Miss Alaska does not represent anyone nor Alaska in any way. It&rsquo;s just another reason I don&rsquo;t pay any attention to these stupid beauty pageants   &mdash;   just a lot of phony, silly, PC nonsense. Thanks for posting that picture.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-352940" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>let me give you a slightly different version of race relations in america (and i am not a liberal (or a conservative or libertarian)).</p>
<p>When the whites came over to north america, the indian population had already been decimated by exposure to smallpox etc. Their population had been reduced by up to 90%. There was already plenty of room.</p>
<p>North America was a place to make money for those who had a little to spend. So they forced the poor of the british isles to work as labor in america. They did this in various ways. Kidnapping was one way. They would grab up kids in england and scotland and make them hoe the tobacco fields of north america. That was where the word &#8216;kidnapped&rsquo; came from. It was first &#8216;kid nabbed&rsquo; and it changed to kidnapped. Or they would drug you or knock you in the head and you would wake up aboard a ship bound for north america. The people they hired to do this were called &#8216;spirits&rsquo;. That was where the phrase &#8216;spirited away&rsquo; came from.</p>
<p>The upper class also created laws aimed against the poor (begging, sleeping outdoors etc). That way when they broke them, they would be sent to america to work in the fields.</p>
<p>This was called being &#8216;transported&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Why were there so many poor people around? The rich people had decided to take most of the common land in england and scotland for themselves and throw the peasants off the land.</p>
<p>That made many people homeless.</p>
<p>Supposedly the people who were sent from england and scotland and ireland to work in america were to be set free after a certain number of years. But this was propaganda. Once they got you over to america, you were typically stripped and sold at auction. Sometimes you would be set free after your indentureship was through, and sometimes not.</p>
<p>Sometimes they worked till you dropped dead or escaped. If you worked near the towns, you had a better chance of getting set free once 7 years expired (or 4 sometimes). But out in the country, you were often dead meat.</p>
<p>They were white slaves. They were often even called white slaves. </p>
<p>Then after a few decades the poor of the british isles got smart and the supply of white slaves ran low.</p>
<p>So they got some black slaves. At first the black slaves were also indentured for a period of years. However, the upper class got the idea of separating the whites from blacks by creating laws against whites and blacks mixing. Remember that during the 1600s in order to run for office you had to be a property owner. The masses of indentured slaves and freed slaves could not vote. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-352941" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>CONTINUED FROM ABOVE</p>
<p>But the whites and black slaves did mix. In one survey taken in<br/>
maryland in the 1600s, about one third of all babies born to female<br/>
white slaves were mixed race. </p>
<p>Then in about 1670 the whites and blacks rebelled together in bacon&rsquo;s rebellion and burned Jamestown VA to the ground. That rebellion was actually class warfare, the lower class, white and black, rebelling against the upper class. So the upper class<br/>
decided to divide the races using laws the upper class politicians<br/>
created (politicians who were elected by landowners). They created the<br/>
miscegenation laws and similar laws to divide the poor whites from the<br/>
poor blacks through a &#8220;screen of racial contempt&#8221; (quote from Dr<br/>
Morgan&rsquo;s textbook AMERICAN SLAVERY AMERICAN FREEDOM). </p>
<p>They did this to bind poor whites to the rich whites through skin color. Thus<br/>
they split their lower class enemy into two weaker enemies. Divide and<br/>
conquer. This is the primary tool of the upper class in america.</p>
<p>Thus the upper class created the genesis of all american culture, where<br/>
whites share an elevated social status, above blacks. This culture was<br/>
created by the upper class to save their necks in the 1600s.</p>
<p>The upper class also created the &#8216;one drop&rsquo; rule. One drop of black blood and you were a slave.</p>
<p>THat was how the upper class created a supply of cheap labor. </p>
<p>The upper class always seeks a supply of cheap labor. Nowadays they get it<br/>
from the third world. Mass immigration. In decent nations, like the<br/>
small nations of western europe, mass immigration is controlled by the<br/>
people. Not in america, however. The upper class rules america. Always<br/>
have.</p>
<p>The only way out of this mess is by racial segregation and dissolution of the federal union.</p>

<p>But my point, which seem to miss, is that Denmark and most of the other western nations are in MUCH BETTER SHAPE THAN AMERICA. Why? Because they have FEWER IMMIGRANTS BY PERCENT. IS that so hard to understand?</p>

<p>The reason Europe is closer to solving the problem than we are is because of the ethnonationalist implications of most European countries, that their parliamentary systems and political cultures are conducive to multi-party political systems. Therefore, it is worth the while of ethnonationalist political parties to exist and for people to invest time energy and activism in them because the chances of that leading to real sociopolitical change is credibly high. </p>
<p>Look at Norway. The Progress Party got 16.3% of the vote, about one-sixth, but it&rsquo;s going to be able to wield some influence in the new Norwegian government. An American political party that gets 16.3% of the vote won&rsquo;t be able to influence anything.</p>

The USA has millions of non-White illegal migrants as well as millions of non-White foreign nationals here legally such as students. The percentage of non-Whites would be a lot lower if you only counted citizens. However, whether these non-Whites stay or go home will depend on the USA economy. If this nation and its&rsquo; economy gets bad enough so that there are no jobs, no money and no welfare, then the percentage of non-Whites will drop drastically. If things remain as they are however, it&rsquo;s not likely these foreign non-Whites will go anywhere.</p>

However, even within the tribes certain men had more property than others, e.g., the chief and his string of horses. It is also true that the Indians invaded each other and slaughtered each other by the thousands. In the State of Texas, it was the Comanche that came in and killed and/or ran off all others, that is, until the Texans killed and/or ran them out.</p>

<p> White supremacy is the belief of, and/or promotion of the belief, that white people are superior to people of other racial backgrounds and that therefore whites should politically dominate non-whites. The term is also used to describe a political<br/>
ideology that perpetuates and maintains the social, political, historical and/or industrial dominance of whites.</p>
<p> And this is the cause of all conflict on the face of the earth now, then, and forever. God, you are a simplistic moron. I would feel sorry for you, but you are my enemy. No pity. But here&rsquo;s a question, do you ever think for yourself? I understand you either belong to some minority victim group, or you&rsquo;re a brain-dead white Left-liberal raised and nurtured on History according to the anti-American, anti-white, Howard Zinn, and as such, it makes you feel so good to be able to put aside your own whiteness and embrace the Other. </p>
<p>It is now fashionable to not only claim that white supremacy, aka white people, is the total evil in the world, but also that white people didn&rsquo;t really invent, or create the greatest civilization that the world has ever known. Oh, no. We can&rsquo;t have little Chinese, Indian (from India), Africans, Latino kids knowing that the West invented everything while most of their kinsmen still haven&rsquo;t invented the flush-toilet. Truth be damned.</p>
<p>If I were you it would scare the hell out of me to think that I have been lied to all my life. You will go to your grave clueless. But then, lies mean nothing to those who don&rsquo;t believe in truth.</p>

As far as racial conflict in the USA now, it is NOT White supremacy as Whites are subordinated to non-Whites in today&rsquo;s America. Our racial conflict, much of it between non-White groups such as Blacks vs Hispanics is caused by multiculturalism and mass immigration and the fact that multiracialism does NOT work . In past history, if the USA had never had slavery, then Blacks would not have experienced &#8220;White supremacy&#8221;. As a matter of fact, in EVERY non-White country, the people there have &#8220;supremacy. In Mexico, there is &#8220;Mexican supremacy&#8221;, in Nigeria &#8220;Black Nigerian supremacy&#8221;, in Japan &#8220;Japanese supremacy&#8221;. Non-White nations do NOT allow mass immigration of other races because they feel they are supreme. This is why the races should stay in separate nations. That way no person is subject to the majority&rsquo;s &#8220;supremacy&#8221;.</p>

<p>In this book Phillips wrote that the New Deal taxed the richest ten percent of the population to fund programs that helped the remaining 90 percent, so it was politically sustainable. The War on Poverty taxed the richest 90 percent of the population to fund programs that helped the poorest 10 percent. Therefore, Phillips predicted that the War on Poverty would provoke a backlash that would help the Republicans.</p>
<p>This is just exactly what did happen. No Democratic politician who actually wants to be elected talks about ending poverty anymore. </p>
<p>The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which President Clinton signed, ended Aid to Families with Dependent Children as a lifetime entitlement.</p>
<p>Liberal activists try to preserve as much of AFDC as they can, but they know that the voters are not with them. </p>
<p>When the War on Poverty was begun declared in 1964 there was optimistic talk about ending poverty in ten years. No one talks that way now.</p>

Arab/Berber conquests in Spain and Sicily changed the character of the people who lived in both Spain and Italy. Colonialism caused intermixture in the cases of Spain, Portugal, France, the Netherlands, and Britain. The Nordic countries have historic admixture with Mongoloid peoples who lived in the far North (trust me, meet different people from Scandinavia and you can see the difference between the pureblood and the part skraeling). It should also be noted that after the Scandinavians became Christians, but before they gave up the prctice of slavery, they took slaves from among both the pagan Baltic peoples as well as the Saracens, as they could no longer treat their fellow Christians with such disdain. There are also possibilities of intermixture related to the invasions of the Huns, Avars, Mongols, Turks, and Soviet troops from the East.</p>
<p>I do agree that what they are doing is horrible and that said countries were originally populated by Caucasoid peoples. That changing the ethnic character of those nations should be considered genocide. Obviously there is no historic basis for changing the ethnic base of the population.</p>

<p>Notice how Taylor in his essay, at no point, provides any evidence whatsoever as to why conflict between races is &#8216;deeply biological&rsquo;.</p>
<p>His kindergarten logic goes like this: There was conflict between Indians and whites. Indians and whites are of different races. Therefore the reason for conflict is &#8216;deeply biological&rsquo; (read racial).</p>
<p>Well I also believe the reason for conflict between human groups is &#8216;deeply biological&rsquo; - but not racial. All humans and human groups want to hold on to land and resources perceived as their own - that may well be a biological instinct. </p>
<p>But Irish have fought hard against English to hang on to what is there own, there has been all sorts of intra-European blood-lettings throughout history.</p>
<p>So is that some sort of evidence that people hate people of their <i>own</i> race? Using Taylor&rsquo;s argument it could be.</p>

<p>&#8220;If all people in the world were of the same race, inter-group conflict<br/>
would not be reduced by one iota - this is supported by the evidence of history.&#8221;</p>
<p>A single counter-example suffices to disprove this, the Chicago Race Riot of 1919 or the Detroit Race Riot of 1967, say. If it&rsquo;s your view that race had nothing whatever to do with either of these events (or the hundreds or thousands like them throughout the world), then all I can say is that yours is distinctly a minority opinion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll bet it would be the most interesting (and informative, and honest) talk most of the students would hear during their entire four years there.

<p>But, the Bushlet got his deserved lashings from the media on a regular basis, whereas the Caramel Messiah gets nothing but hagiographies. And this bugs me. As much as I loathe Dubya.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-354313" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;America&rsquo;s slow collapse into Third-World squalor will be a good thing for certain other countries. At the risk of only slight exaggeration, America&rsquo;s conception of foreign policy seems to be that if we invade a country and shoot enough people, the survivors will automatically become Jeffersonian democrats. Our capacity to do that kind of mischief will decline very quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very disappointed to see this gratuitous, distracting cheap shot on foreign policy. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly struck by how so many people who have sound and sensible views on race are in complete agreement with anti-white, anti-American leftists, even Marxists and Islamists, on foreign policy issues. While remaining entirely oblivious to the massive contradiction involved. On the one hand you&rsquo;ll hear eloquent speeches telling whites to shake off white-guilt mythology, embrace the superiority of Western Civilization, understand that we are altruistic in a way no other people is. And from those very same people you&rsquo;ll hear nonsense implying or flat-out stating that modern America is a monstrous aggressor, victimizing innocent brown Muslims, that the sovereignty of some tinpot Third World dictatorship should be gravely respected, etc.</p>
<p>We invaded Germany, Japan, and Italy, and all three nations are now as democratic as can be. Germany and Japan had had essentially no prior history of democracy or limited consensual government, and with Italy, you&rsquo;d have to go back to the Roman Republic thousands of years ago to find anything like it. One might be forgiven a certain skepticism about the prospects of installing a functional democracy in those states, given the lack of any roots for it.</p>
<p>Yes, Iraq and Afghanistan are different. Their peoples have an IQ of averaging 85. They are multi-ethnic, multi-religious states with no real nationhood. They would probably be better off broken up into component nation-states. But our invasions of those two countries were not only justified (9/11 in the first case, a long history of deliberate violation of peace agreements and treaty obligations in the second), but were benevolent, not acts of wanton massacre.</p>
<p>Taylor does the greatest white nation that ever existed a gross disservice with such petty calumnies.</p>
<p>And then to exhibit lip-smacking relish at the prospect of American decline, one which would enfeeble us and make us no longer able to stand up to some other nonwhite petty tyrant and give his long-suffering subjects a replacement regime that, while not Heaven on Earth, is at least something better than they had before? Outrageous.</p>

Think about it for a minute. White people oppressed other white people so they left for a better life and ended up oppressing everybody else while claiming cultural superiority. In reality whites have been oppressing and killing each other since before medieval times. In modern times, more than 85% of whites that are murdered are killed by other white people but you supremacists are still more scared of darker people. You look like clowns, join rest of humanity already.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-354477" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Very interesting piece. One concern, not so much with the author but with a commonly accepted notion that &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; will outnumber &#8220;whites&#8221; on some given date. What is not addressed in this statistic (I do have a bit of formal research training) is that a large percentage, if not the majority of Hispanics&rsquo; (including myself) birth certificates read &#8220;Caucasian&#8221;. The ethnic flavor (not racial) of any specific Hispanic ranges from traitorous members of La Rasa to those of us who those of us who have for 3-4 generations assimilated to the point of losing our original language and being opposed to any slackening of immigration statutes. In addition, my Mexican (pure Spanish) ancestors and my current &#8220;old-country&#8221; relations have held no confraternity with Cubans, Puerto Ricans,etc. (in fact, they often express disdain for being confused with them). We are essentially ignored in the national dialogue because we have adopted American individualism and while waxing romantically about our heritage from time to time, consider ourselves white Americans&hellip;and often have the blue eyes to prove it :-)!</p>
