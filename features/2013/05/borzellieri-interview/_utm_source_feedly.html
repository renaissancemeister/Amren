Jared Taylor interviews Frank Borzellieri.</div> 
</div> 


<p>Frank Borzellieri, who spoke at several American Renaissance conferences and who wrote a popular column for a chain of Long Island newspapers, switched careers and became a teacher and then a school principal in the Catholic school system. When a newspaper wrote recently about  his earlier writings and his association with AR, the church summarily fired him.</p>
<p>This is an astonishing saga  of lies, cowardice, and betrayal.</p>

Even though I&rsquo;m not religious, I can empathize with his experience of having a lifetime&rsquo;s worth of faith in someone or something, only to be let down by that person or thing because they weren&rsquo;t resilient enough or didn&rsquo;t have the integrity to stick to the principles and faith they espoused.</p>

<p>The future of information on the internet is video. Video conferences, video exposes, video interviews. AR isn&rsquo;t taking full advantage of this medium to get their message out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see Skype split screen interviews that are posted here and on youtube. These are the types of interviews that will reach a large audience and give AR notoriety and brand recognition.</p>

Actually reading something forces you to use your mind, as opposed to watching a video, which doesn&rsquo;t demand as much from you. It&rsquo;s important we continue to read and thus conjure up our own visions, thoughts, etc. Read William Sleator&rsquo;s book &#8216;House of Stairs&rsquo;, in which some teens react in stunned disbelief to a boy&rsquo;s confession that he actually read something rather than having it dictated to him over a computer monitor. The other teens couldn&rsquo;t believe that one&rsquo;s own imagination could be better than anything you could see on a computer screen. Needless to say, that book-reading boy, Peter, was one of only two teens to successfully resist the mind-control experiments which turned the video-loving teens into monsters.</p>

suitably moderated, allow the Internet to be used for, in effect,<br/>
informal &#8220;hearings&#8221; toward clarifying facts or disputes about facts. This<br/>
allows a complete factual record to be laid out. The Internet also allows primary source material (e.g., full and faithful written trial transcripts) to be<br/>
accessible online. The conventional format of publishing journal articles<br/>
as a lead in to discussion and factual exploration has given rise to what<br/>
I regard as &#8220;paste and scissors&#8221; creation of presumed factual information that when examined from raw first hand testimony or other primary source material, turns out to have the status of adorned rumor. The internet if<br/>
properly used for email discussions ( properly moderated) enable Mr. Fact to join hands with Mr. Reason to lay a far firmer and more adequate foundation for conceptualization and reasoned disputation.</p>

They tried to scare me by asking me all these questions about my address and what parish I was in like they would excommunicate me. Assholes. I don&rsquo;t know if Cardinal Tim Dolan was in place at the time, he seemed to have more backbone but I guess not. They really let us down. But Frank most of all.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-275151" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Are you speaking about Catholicism? If so, it cannot possibly be &#8220;counterfeit Christian&#8221; as it was the first Christian church ever established and remained that way for approximately 1500 years until revolutionaries like Martin Luther and Henry VIII decided to found their own churches. There are now, in the US alone, more than 35,000 protestant nondenominational churches. That is the result of the break with Rome - a formless scattering of Christianity everywhere. Something that was the founding faith cannot, by definition, be counterfeit. Many anti-Catholic people don&rsquo;t even know that the word &#8220;catholic&#8221; itself means &#8220;universal&#8221; although it is now synonymous with the Church of Rome or the Universal Christian Church. Which is the one Jesus Christ was referring to when he described the church that the gates of hell shall not prevail against.<br/>
Unlike the storefront church you probably go to, right? Is that the First Pentecostal Union of Christians or something like that? I guess the one true church that has lasted through till now is the one that&rsquo;s got it all wrong? That sounds about right. Faith of our fathers living still through dungeon, fire and sword is about the Catholic church, not some 5th level branch off the Baptist or Methodist church&hellip;..</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-281869" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I don&rsquo;t think that this short article reveals anything but business as usual. How blind are those whose conceit informs them that they see! </p>
<p>This article merely shows that Christianity hasn&rsquo;t changed; it changes with the current needs and always has. What it can&rsquo;t absorb it destroys and since its power to destroy has been hampered in modern times, it seeks to survive more through compromises than it used to. But it sure flipped between Kings, Capitalist and Fascists pretty readily, regardless of the effect on its &#8220;flock.&#8221; (Always been a bunch of sheep). If the Bolsheviks hadn&rsquo;t closed the Churches down, it no doubt would have made deals with them. The problem is that since they chase away intellectuals, they end up on the Left and against the Church.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s church is as politically correct as it ever was. People have always been dealt with harshly (firing being pretty tame in comparison with the practices of the past). The problem is that it is hardly for it to pretend and support despotism against the very alleged words of Jesus in their own scriptures. In the past, no one knew because no one could read and then weren&rsquo;t allowed to own Bibles. It took hundreds of years to gain access and then hundreds of more years to undo the damage that these &#8220;Christians&#8221; had done to the European (white) psyche during the reign of terror that lasted up to at least the 15th century.</p>
<p>I think that some &#8220;Christians&#8221; are still suffering a post Fascist era hangover. But if you think that Fascist Catholic Christians are somehow racial purists or care about the survival of the white race, explain why Franco shipped in Berber Muslims to fight for him during the Spanish Civil War? Or why the Basques were Republicans, supporting the Republic while also being devout Catholics?</p>
<p>The only explanation is that Christianity has always sought to gain and hold power and therefore wealth. It suppressed Europeans and then the rest of the world when it could. Christianity was so racially backward in its start that even numbers were considered heretical. Math was of the Devil and books were banned. It took the revival by overwhelming numbers of people that finally could not be denied to bring about the Renaissance and then the advent of the Age of Reason., which is responsible for ALL Western advances. If left to its devices, Europeans would still be burned at the stake for knowing how to do multiplication or how to use a &#8220;magic square.&#8221; The world would still be flat and others, likely the Muslims would have eventually conquered us. </p>
<p>Today in America, it is our religious ignorance that is seeing our best brains going elsewhere. Christianity trying to control or own science is to blame. Texas was building an electron accelerator three times larger than the one in Switzerland, but a Christian Congressman asked if it would allow &#8220;us&#8221; to discover God. The scientist gave a scientific answer and the funding for the Texas accelerator was defeated by one vote. Since then, scientists have allowed journalists to interpret for the public. So the Higgs-boson particle became &#8220;The God Particle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scientists actually learned to play this game some time ago and so by the 18th century, some lower religious orders in Europe became a good place for researchers to hide. One thing that keeps coming around is that you cannot keep the human spirit and mind down for long. Funny to think that those who think that God created man and his mind out of his own will have so much trouble coping with its free use and expression.</p>
<p>The real lesson of this article is to wake up race realists to the fact that Christianity has NEVER been a home or reserve for white, racial exclusivity. The sooner you guys free your selves of the entire delusion of Christianity and religion, the sooner you will find your true center and your real power.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-281824" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The Roman Catholic Church was not the first or even true church. It was merely the one that gained the most power and prevailed during the Roman Emperor Constantine&rsquo;s time through his Counsels at Nicea that he called to settle the questions that had various - and widely varying brands of Christianity warring with one another since the second century. In order to finally prevail, the Nazarine, Pauline Christians actually poisoned Arius of Alexandria. Constantine was actually an Arian Christian that converted or was converted on is deathbed to Pauline Christianity. Once in power, all other ideas and Christian practices were declared heretic and harshly (famously) persecuted for the next thousand years. This and much more revealing (and condemning) history of Christianity is historical fact and as close as a paperback abridged version of Edward Gibbon&rsquo;s classic, &#8220;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, Catholicism is no different from the later Protestantism in that it is constructed from ideas and beliefs borrowed from earlier forms of religion such as Judaism, but also polytheistic paganism. Pagan holidays remained, but were given Christian names and themes. The halo for example is a modification of the icon of Apollo who was always painted with the full sun behind his head. This is seen even clearer when one looks at a Greek Orthodox icon. Catholic meant that it was the accepted mix of doctrines and themes and it was intended to make it as easy as possible for people to accept. Paul (Saul) himself admitted to &#8220;stealing&#8221; from others and &#8220;lying to bring the truth&#8221; (very convenient). This early practice led to a habit of appropriating everything into Christianity that could not be either destroyed or changed enough to appear congruent. Things were famously stretched for the Crusades and especially for the Albigensian Crusade against &#8220;heretical&#8221; Christians in Southern France. Anyway, Christianity has always been changing with the times and with what is necessary and convenient for its survival and expanding earthly power base. </p>
<p>What is happening now is nothing unusual for Christianity. The delusion that Christianity favored whites over any other race actually covers a very short period of history only made possible by isolation. Individual Christians might think that their version made them special, but the missionaries were ever on the frontiers, converting the non-whites and giving the same hopes and dreams, because that has been the mission of Christianity since its start. Whites that think otherwise are self-deluded, that is all. The sooner they get over their delusion, the better for all whites, even Leftists.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-282034" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think if you focus only on the negative aspects of the Catholic Church, Catholicism in general and what is happening now you would not want anything to do with it, especially because of the pedophile scandals and cover-ups. The fact remains that it is the one holy Catholic and apostolic church. For those of us that are devout Catholics, we do not run off and bail out to some other church when the church is in peril as it is now. The great apostasy is here, and one of the prophesies of Fatima is that &#8220;Satan will enter into My Son&rsquo;s Church&#8221;. That is why the sickness we are now seeing is so prevalent as homosexual satanic pedophilia is the culmination. There was a ceremony in the chapel of St. Peter and Paul in the Vatican which was &#8220;The Enthronement of Lucifer in the Vatican&#8221; in the &rsquo;60s which coincided with Vatican II.<br/>
The other sects were merely that - shattered groups of revolutionaries jockeying for their own special brand of Christianity - that does not mean there was not one church that was the mystical body of Christ ( the church has been through the same experiences as Christ. First a successful teacher, then an object of hatred an envy, then betrayed and placed on trial, then scourged and persecuted (the present) and of course much more is to follow. The One True Church most definitely was the most populated, the most powerful, and so what if that was certified at the Council of Nicea? We say the Nicean Creed in a Catholic mass. There is one true church, and without revolutionaries who challenged it at every possible turn (as God&rsquo;s most favored archangel also did to Him, and fell to hell in the one flash of lightening) the church would be far more powerful and would have maintained it&rsquo;s pre-Vatican II militancy and strength. The Rothschilds and freemasons are in the Vatican now and have brought their devil with them. Also prophesied by the Holy Mother at Fatima is that &#8220;My immaculate heart will triumph&#8221; so evidently they are barking up the wrong tree&hellip;. Challenging God and his church is for demons and heretics. Other people have their religions and I would never dream of commenting on it - I speak in protection of my own church when someone insults it. And I recognize the hatred for what it is - pure hatred of something spiritual and holy which has not been unexpected in these times.</p>

There are two different types of people in this world, &#8216;givers and takers&rsquo;. Frank is 100% unequivocally a giver in the truest sense of the term.<br/>
This story proves that even the most devout Catholics can be jealous. There was obviously jealousy and backbiting or else this may not have happened. Why would the Catholic church throw one of their superstars under the bus? What does Frank&rsquo;s story tell us?</p>

The ethics of the flourishing of life are evolutionary laws, the law of the jungle. part of that genetic strategy in humans involved an irrational moral complex of various altruistic co evolutionary relationship.But it is objectively a biological [and social] construct subject to changing environments and random mutations, under the right combination Hitler is only doing what is needed to survive his success proves his moral righteousness.On some level lefties get this and try to keep all the balls in the air. Perhaps it is why to some extent the progressives abandoned social Darwinism.we have picked up a very difficult sale. My guess is many in the Alt Right are above average how does this sell to the masses? Youre superior to the mud people? Its an uphill sell but say its workable, We need to assure the bottom 50% of the top 50% they are not next on the list. Reversion to the mean and the randomness of genetics wont be scientific constraints for long.</p>

Never mistake Catholicism for Christianity&hellip;it is a counterfeit.<br/>
I think there are closet realists in my church, which is independent fundamental Baptist. We go out and knock on doors (and find that the JWs have done some damage) and from some passing comments I&rsquo;ve heard from other members&hellip;you can tell there&rsquo;s a bit of realism there. I mean, you can&rsquo;t go out soulwinning or go off on a mission field in Africa and not be hit with the truth at some point-you would think.<br/>
I may identify with IFB but I sure don&rsquo;t buy into diversity. Yeah, spiritually Christians are one in Christ&hellip;but in the natural, there are still those differences amongst the races. Each race should have its own nation(s) and build them up (or run them into the ground) as they see fit.</p>

Frank Borzellieri was an elected school board member for three terms (total of 11 years) here in Queens. Those boards were in charge of the local PUBLIC schools. In 2004, the State of New York abolished school boards in New York City altogether. The job of a school board member was not full-time work, but a policy-making position. Frank could not be removed from the school board because he was elected - he was very popular with local voters. Separate from all that, Frank chose a career in education, where he was a principal of a CATHOLIC school. There are no &#8220;school boards&#8221; in the Catholic system. You are hired and fired by the pastor, the priest in charge of the school. That&rsquo;s what heppened to Frank, even though he had an outstanding record. He was fired for political reasons, as you saw in this video.</p>

<p>It would have helped if Mr. Borzellieri quoted from his writings, because he may have made some cogent points that any reasonable person could agree with. </p>
<p>In addition, what he wrote that got him fired a few years ago from his teaching post, may seem a little more mainstream now.</p>
<p>This is because a lot of comments readers make to articles at mainstream news organizations, like CNN and ABC, NBC, and CBS, now read like the more balanced and judicious comments written about race and Islam that appeared in the past at publications like American Renaissance.</p>
<p>American Renaissance was the only place where people could read about the forbidden news the mainstream news organizations refused to publish because it did not fit their agenda of pretending that the races all get along great with each other when we know this is not the case.</p>
<p>That being said, the Catholic Church (in spite of all of its problems) appears to be the only place where we might be able to solve the dilemma of the different races learning how to truly get along with each other in a decent and civilized way,</p>

If you want to change people&rsquo;s minds you need to give them compelling ideas.</p>
