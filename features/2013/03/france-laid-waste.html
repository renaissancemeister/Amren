Immigration and crime in <em>la belle France</em>.</div> 
</div> 


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Laurent Obertone, <i>La France Orange Mécanique</i>, Ring, 2013, 350 pp., €18 (in French only)</strong></p>
<p><i>La France Orange Mécanique</i> (<i>Clockwork Orange France</i>) became an instant best seller in France, finding itself in the top-ten list on Amazon.fr despite no advertising and a virtually unknown author. Even in a climate of reduced book sales, the publisher, Ring, has recently had an additional 18,000 copies printed. Some reviewers note that if this book &mdash; which describes the true face of crime in France &mdash; had been published before last year&rsquo;s presidential elections, it might have had an impact on the outcome, swaying votes towards the Right.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FranceOrangeMécanique.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103431" alt="FranceOrangeMécanique" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FranceOrangeMécanique.jpg" width="431" height="421"/></a></p>
<p>The book, whose title refers to the 1962 Anthony Burgess novel about &ldquo;ultra-violence,&rdquo; begins with an all-too-common event: a white woman is savagely beaten and raped almost to death by a foreigner. This gruesome rape is presented from the victim&rsquo;s perspective, allowing the reader to grasp the horror of the situation &mdash; a horror that can be washed away in a sea of statistics: 7 percent of French women are raped at some point in their lives, and there are 13,000 thefts, 2,000 assaults and 200 rapes every day in France. Behind these statistics, there are personal dramas and shattered lives. For each crime, there is a life that will never be the same. This is what Laurent Obertone wants us to remember: Crime is not a matter of numbers; it is devastating trauma.</p>
<p>Beyond the crime statistics, many lives are ruined by daily harassment from immigrants, but victims get no support from society and resign themselves to their fate. They suffer from depression, fear, and even suicide, but they never appear in official reports: They will be forgotten and ignored.</p>
<p>In pointing out how heavily concentrated crime is among immigrants, Mr. Obertone breaks a major taboo. He is frank about the vast overrepresentation of Gypsies and North Africans in French prisons. In France, there are no official statistics about ethnicity and crime, but there are figures for the number of <i>foreigners</i> in the prison system (22 percent). These statistics are skewed because an Arab born in France is considered a Frenchman. Ironically, Mr. Obertone has to cite a study reported in the <i>Washington Post</i> to conclude that between 60 and 70 percent of the prison population is Muslim.</p>
<p>Mr. Obertone has also found local racial statistics on crime for some towns and cities, which confirm the overrepresentation of non-whites in prison. He shows that this not a uniquely French phenomenon; in European countries blacks and Arabs are always overrepresented in the criminal population. He makes an air-tight case for what everyone knows but dares not say: The explosion of crime is directly linked to immigration.</p>

<p>France is, indeed, becoming one of the most dangerous of all Western societies: 1,200 homicides each year and 1,000 attempted homicides. Crime now costs French citizens 115 billion Euros each year &mdash; twice the revenue generated from income taxes. Common criminals now confront police with automatic rifles and assault weapons, once used only by organized crime.</p>
<p>Police officers themselves are victims of harassment and open provocation by criminals, but receive no support from the media or authorities. When they enforce the law they are routinely accused of &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; Mr. Obertone reports that the police union now says offices are afraid to use force, for fear of racial consequences. Criminals therefore no longer fear the police, and their authority is further diminished when criminals get limited or no jail time. There are few deterrents to crime and criminals know it.</p>
<p>This undoubtedly explains why race riots in France are more frequent and violent than in any other European country. The authorities have surrendered to blackmail and have invested billions of Euros in some 700 &ldquo;sensitive neighborhoods,&rdquo; proving that the more you destroy, the more you are rewarded. Police rarely enter these neighborhoods for fear their mere presence could be a &ldquo;provocation.&rdquo; Mr. Obertone says that the media and politicians nevertheless blame the police for the high percentage of immigrants in jail. The only accepted explanations are discrimination and profiling.</p>
<div id="attachment_103433" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 525px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FrenchView.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-103433" alt="The liberal view of the police." src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FrenchView.jpg" width="515" height="466"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The liberal view of the police.</p></div>
<p>The French judiciary system is like that of the United States in the 1960s and &rsquo;70s: the emphasis is on prevention and rehabilitation. For French sociologists and so-called experts, it is still the fashion to blame society exclusively for crime. The focus is thus on compassion for the culprit, with no regard for the victim. Basically, only recidivists are sentenced to prison, and prison terms are often suspended.</p>
<p>In France, 2,250 women have been raped by recidivists. According to Mr. Obertone, the real number is considerably higher, because some rapists are never caught and because some rapes are classified as &ldquo;sexual assaults&rdquo; and are therefore not counted as rape.</p>
<p>Even with low incarceration rates, prisons are at 117 percent of capacity. Socialist politicians block the construction of new jails, which they would see as an admission that society is failing. Only in the 1980s and 1990s did Americans come to realize that long prison terms are what keep a society safe.</p>
<p>The media hide the reality of crime in France, using euphemisms to talk about the few events they dare to mention. Criminals are &ldquo;youths,&rdquo; even if they are in their twenties, and savagery is sanitized<b> </b>with<b> </b>such<b> </b>terms as &ldquo;aggravated assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;sexual assault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The government helps cover things up, launching campaigns for traffic safety and condemning domestic violence against women, although these phenomena are statistically insignificant. These campaigns detract from the real problems, and suggest a lack of political will to solve them. On the political front, everyone is silent. The Right is afraid of the Left, and the Left is afraid of the truth.</p>
<div id="attachment_103430" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 562px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FrenchYouths.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-103430 " alt="French &quot;youths&quot;--Muslims and Africans--rioted throughout Parisian suburbs and other cities, leading authorities to declare a state of emergency." src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FrenchYouths.jpg" width="552" height="331"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In 2005, French &#8220;youths&#8221;-Muslims and Africans-rioted throughout Parisian suburbs and other cities, leading authorities to declare a state of emergency.</p></div>
<p>And yet, there are crimes the media and politicians are happy to discuss: those against certain minorities. Fighting anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and homophobia are important priorities, and the government spends a great deal of money trying to eradicate these evils. However, Mr. Obertone notes that only 0.03 percent of the Muslims, 0.06 percent of the Jews, and 0.007 percent of homosexuals are reported victimized each year. Why single them out, when a far larger percentage &mdash; 0.7 percent &mdash; of French natives are victimized each year? Despite what the media and politicians say, it is safer to be a Jew, a Muslim, or a homosexual than to be an ordinary Frenchman. Needless to say, minor acts committed against minorities are huge stories, while luridly racist crimes committed against whites are downplayed or ignored.</p>
<p>Mr. Obertone writes that most of the French seem to have fallen asleep in front of their TV sets and shut themselves off from what is happening in their country. Even when they realize something is wrong, they are afraid to speak up, afraid of being called a racist and thus risking their livelihoods. As it is everywhere in the West, anyone accused of racism is guilty until proven innocent.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Dogs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103435" alt="Dogs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Dogs.jpg" width="480" height="336"/></a></p>
<p>In France there is a myriad of antiracist groups that play the role of &ldquo;thought police,&rdquo; and ensure that no one questions the system. These groups, generously subsidized by the government, target only one type of racism and are completely blind towards anti-white racism &mdash; even though today, one French native in ten considers himself a victim of racism.</p>
<div id="attachment_103434" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DeathToWhites.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-103434" alt="&quot;Death to whites.&quot;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DeathToWhites.jpg" width="550" height="448"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Death to whites.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>In his discussion about the cause of crime, Mr. Obertone refers to IQ without explicitly mentioning race. He explains that the average unskilled worker has an IQ of 92, and that the great majority of Arabs are working class. Thus, we cannot expect the same results from them as from French natives. His logic is a simple way of implying racial differences without stating them bluntly. Candor on these matters can bring criminal charges.</p>
<p>Despite the serious nature of the<b> </b>topic of this book, the tone is sometimes humorous. The author is not overly academic or sensationalist, and the book is easy to read despite its liberal use of statistics. Mr. Obertone does not make utopian promises about stopping crime; he simply presents a realistic portrait of a situation deliberately ignored by the media and politicians. But the mere appearance of a book of this kind and the reception it has received are grounds for celebration.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-223120" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;7 percent of French women are raped at some point in their lives, and there are 13,000 thefts, 2,000 assaults and 200 rapes every day in France. Behind these statistics, there are personal dramas and shattered lives. For each crime, there is a life that will never be the same. This is what Laurent Obertone wants us to remember: Crime is not a matter of numbers; it is devastating trauma. . .</p>
<p>Beyond the crime statistics, many lives are ruined by daily harassment from immigrants, but victims get no support from society and resign themselves to their fate. They suffer from depression, fear, and even suicide, but they never appear in official reports: They will be forgotten and ignored.&#8221;</p>
<p>Article 2 of the Convention defines genocide as</p>
<p>&hellip;any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:</p>
<p>(a) Killing members of the group;<br/>
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; ✓<br/>
(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; ✓<br/>
(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;<br/>
(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</p>
<p>Article 3 defines the crimes that can be punished under the convention:</p>
<p>(a) Genocide;<br/>
(b) Conspiracy to commit genocide;<br/>
(c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide;<br/>
(d) Attempt to commit genocide;<br/>
(e) Complicity in genocide. ✓</p>

A duty to keep records concerning who is raping whom is implied in the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. A government cannot prevent or punish a genocide that it does not know is happening because of its own failure to keep records. Having abetted the invasion of their country by foreigners, using weaponized history to guilt the native population into submission and thereby inciting hatred against them, the government is duty-bound to track interracial crime and respond appropriately.

You cannot prevent or punish a genocide that you don&rsquo;t know is happening or may happen.<br/>
The government has deliberately created multiracial conditions and used weaponized history to guilt the native population into submission. This weaponized history in turn incites hatred against the natives among the foreign settlers. Having deliberately subjected the native population to genocidal risk factors, the government is duty-bound to keep detailed records concerning who is robbing, raping, and murdering whom.<br/>
Because they are not doing that, all inferences must be drawn against them. All victims must be assumed to be White unless and until the government meets its obligations under international law.</p>

<p>As I pointed out in another post here, further down, I lived in Former Yugoslavia and have known many Russian and Ukrainian families here. They have close family ties and a sense of nationalism we whites in the West lack. Those were people in or from former Marxist states. The problem has to do with Western Liberalism, not necessarily Marxism or Socialism. It is about culture.

It is QUITE possible, for instance, for a man like Bill Gates to be both a capitalist extraordinaire AND a Leftist at the same time. But people don&rsquo;t understand this. This has been the biggest failure of the right wing in the West - to educate people about what is happening to them that is remarkably different from the Revolution that Solzhenitsyn experienced in Russia, and in the Cold War era.</p>

In my mind, this is where Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s thoughts come in hand as he was a dedicated socialist who transformed into a devout Christian who saw God&rsquo;s hand in what had happened (in the sense of the chaos and misery caused when man forgets God). Things will have to fall much farther down before most people would even care about what has happened imo. A lot of people thought McCarthy and the John Birch Society were nuts, even though they were right on the money. Then it seems like we can start to rebuild our civilization by returning to our Christian roots.<br/>
I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;ve probably already seen it, but if not you might enjoy the G. Edward Griffin interview with Yuri Bezmenov (KGB defector to the US) who details the mechanics of the Soviet ideological subversion of America.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-228719" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I probably don&rsquo;t consider myself a Westerner? Is this the best you can do? I am the very expression of what a Westerner is and ought to be, while you represent absolutism that will tolerate no variation in thought or creed. Flat earth, book bans, restrictions on thought and free speech? These appear to be your set of Western influences and values. The success of the West has been due to philosophy, not religion and NOT Christianity. It is philosophy that encompasses the notion of free, critical thought and that includes investigation of ideas, and importantly the physical world. I was merely suggesting that there are useful mechanisms in the Socialist model that will be (and have historically been) useful to any group survival, including whites (in the supposed coming upheaval). It was practiced by the first Christians (Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire). If collecting a few fishes and loaves of bread and redistributing them to a larger mass of people isn&rsquo;t communist collectivism, what is? Contrast that to the &#8220;every man for himself&#8221; scenario you seem to be espousing. This will result in WHITE neighbor killing WHITE neighbor, just like blacks do now. </p>
<p>Do you realize that national socialism as espoused by Hitler and<br/>
practiced in Germany during the Third Reich depended upon SOCIALISM<br/>
using collectivism to lift Germany out of its depression? Or do you<br/>
think that only whites making over $200,000.00 a year and in the private<br/>
sector are the only truly WHITE Westerners in existence? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been posting on this forum Since Hurricane Katrina at least and my views, are well demonstrated over time. I&rsquo;ve identified myself as one of Norman descent able to trace my ancestry to the Battle of Hastings. I&rsquo;m a blue eyed, rosy cheeked white man steeped in Western history and practice. I often challenge the stuck in gear views of the typical conservative because we must be innovative as whites if we&rsquo;re going to have a chance in the deluge that is coming. You&rsquo;re just another &#8220;Johnny come lately&#8221; that wants to pick fights with other white race realists in order to make yourself feel more important, not thinking at all, just reacting and making huge assumptions that disqualify you as a rational mind in a productive conversation. You rely on personal attack to pretend to make a point. You make sweeping statements like &#8220;socialism is the antithesis of what it means to be white in the Western sense. This is YOUR opinion. You are writing in the most recognizable style of the ignoramus. </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even seem to realize that Socialism was a construct formed by the effects and events of history in the West. Marx wrote The Communist Manifesto in Brussels, Belguim, not China or even Russia. And he was influenced by the working conditions of most of the WHITE people in Germany and similarly in France, when he visited Paris and saw the poverty WHITE workers lived under there. Then, England and next the U.S., which all had the same thing going on. I wonder if you&rsquo;d enjoy working 16 hour days, live in a dorm room and have the food you eat and the rent you pay taken out of your miserable paycheck? And when you get injured, chucked out the door, literally, bleeding and even dying? How would you like to see your 6 year old children working like that? This is what was going on in the 19th century in the West and like it or not, it was thinkers like Marx whose risks and influence gave YOU the 8 hour work week and other worker&rsquo;s rights, without which there would not have been very many WHITE people left by now. But capitalism has been effecting that seemingly right under your proud, Western WHITE nose!</p>
<p>IF you really understood American history and for example the Industrial Revolution, you&rsquo;d understand why pure capitalism is undesirable and the why and how of what caused Marxism and Socialism to come about. Both lead to rule by a few with no consideration for the average person OR what race they are; however, both have useful features. The intelligent thing to do is learn from both what is most useful and employ them intelligently.</p>
<p>I hope this isn&rsquo;t too much of a strain on your reactionary, intellectual capacity or reading comprehension.</p>

Last time I checked liberalism and the civil rights movement originated here and had way more supporters than in France, so enough with that same old hypocritical projection every time an article about France is linked on Amren. Get it through your head: the indigenous French people never cared about blacks in America, and certainly never asked for their country to be invaded by Arabs just like we&rsquo;re invaded by Mexicans, OK ?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say, but you&rsquo;re perspective about French people is just as brainwashed as liberals about &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>

<p>Anyway, what I&rsquo;d like to see is some super rich whites with racial/civilisational pride pumping some huge sums into exposure/translation/book tours/advertising for ANY books fighting back against this social destruction. Publishers will only tread carefully and tend to invest elsewhere anyway and the media is a known leftist machine. But you can get through the gauntlet with private money. If bieber can be rammed down youth&rsquo;s throats, why can&rsquo;t material like this be rammed down the throats of urbanites? Obviously you can&rsquo;t expect the same conversion %, but some of it will stick. There are a hell of a lot of &#8221;swing&#8221; thinkers out there, but they have to be able to FIND the material.</p>
<p>Surely Trump is just one smashed limo away from full conversion&hellip;</p>

This new religion is consistently on the defensive whilst the other ideologies that attack it are always on the offensive. Human&rsquo;s do not side with losers by nature they side with winners. Also humans like to side with &#8220;the underdog&#8221; christianity has been painted as some kind of GIANT, genocidal, omnipotent force of nature. Whilst other ideologies like Islam, Judaism, New wave marxism have been self promoted as the little guy. The guy that gets beaten up and oppressed by the &#8220;white christian hegemony.&#8221; Of course you know that in the modern world this is all bullshit, but you also know that the average lemming has the political intelligence of a termite. Their thoughts are not their own and they basically believe anything an authority figure tells them. They have also been conditioned to view authority figures as people who fight for &#8220;human rights&#8221; and other liberal bullshit that cloaks the true ulterior motives. As long as these idiots remain in their perpetual intellectual slumber we will continue the plunge into decadence, dysfunction, racial denial, and the normalizing of stupidity. The standards have been lowered across the board and there isn&rsquo;t a damn thing we can do about it.</p>

The New World order, regardless of religious affiliation, is transnational, cross-continental and really only follows the path of mammon. Wealth, greed, injustice, lack of caring or empathy for others, etc&hellip; These are a few earmarks of a psychopath. Anon is correct in this observation. These &#8220;leaders&#8221; (if you want to say that with a straight face) have sold the hard-working family- oriented middle class European and American people down the river for riches. </p>
<p>The Reaganites on through the Bush family to Clinton to Obama all have an obligation. And this goes for incompetent Tony Blair and the French left and even Sarkoczy. That obligation is to flood their countries with cheap and disposable labor, which kowtows to the neocons, under the guise of human rights which kowtows to the liberals. And despite what some on this site might claim, in America we are getting the shaft by BOTH major political parties. It will take a grassroots effort by the blue collar class to get some semblance of power back. </p>
<p>Many on here have a strong disdain for organized labor. But they had some excellent issues at one time that were addressed a generation or two or three in the past. The decline of America&rsquo;s middle class (and from what I&rsquo;ve read, Western Europe, too) has a strong correlation to the breakdown financially, morally and spiritually throughout her communities. The super rich don&rsquo;t care about you. And the super poor, especially low IQ testosterone driven undertow of society, only see you as an easy mark. </p>

<p>I understand where it is coming from in the West. And I also understand it is a common feature in many non-European countries as well. Religion has something to do with it, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</p>

Outside of gay marriage what more do you want?) and so many gays support liberals because of that don&rsquo;t confuse homosexuality with the same destructive force that is liberalism. </p>
<p>The only gays who hate heterosexuals and their families are the militant gays, usually militant lesbian feminists. They truly hate heteros because in their twisted minds the &#8220;male hetero patriarchy&#8221; is all that is wrong with the world. </p>
<p>Here are some things you should consider:</p>
<p>1. There has always been homosexuals<br/>
2. There will always be homosexuals</p>
<p>There will always be about 5% homosexuals in the population. When you attack homosexuality you aren&rsquo;t just attacking the homosexuals but their families as well. They take that kind of personally. So that makes it at least 10% of the population you are attacking. </p>
<p>Homosexuals could be an easy ally since so many non White groups hate them.</p>

He reported in it that the Arab men in the field often resorted to one another for the satisfactions of their &#8220;passion&#8221; rather than engage in sex with the Arab women who he said were often repulsive (unattractive, poor hygiene). It might have been due to the conditions at the time of the Arab Revolt, but it proves that even Muslim Arabs engage in homosexual behavior.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-228756" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I know the differences. You sure make a lot of assumptions. Yugoslavia was not part of the Russian Revolution or Bolshevist, but a union of Southern Slavic states that were never part of the Soviet Union. It came into being AFTER WW2. Tito is famous for his Non-Aligned Nations Movement (know anything about that?) and he was a master at taking advantages (and money) from both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R, playing one against the other. That is why he was a hero to the Yugoslavs (aside from his leadership in WW2). There is nothing better than living somewhere like that for a couple years to make definitions clearer. Yours seem to be coming singly out of your own mind.</p>
<p>What I was speaking of transcends Marxism or the modern Western form of it as produced by influences by the Frankfurt School and the acknowledged leader of the New Left, Herbert Marcuse, who wrote Critical Theory and Eros and Civilization. I know about him and Emanuel Cellar, do you? </p>
<p>What I was referring to and it went RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD was that a deeper culture was still functioning there, something that has been lost in the English speaking West. The ultimate difference was that the ethnic groups, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Bosnians, Bosnian Serbs, all had strong cultural identities. I found the Slovenes for example, incredibly proud to be Slovene, nationalistic to a fault (really ridiculous). I realized that this is what it took for an ethnic group of two million people to survive. The problem NOW is that Western Socialism is creeping and in a place where there were NO blacks at all, blacks have shown up. I don&rsquo;t necessarily see the fall of East Germany or the USSR or Yugoslavia as a bad thing. Life if far more dangerous now in Russia and former Soviet states and former Yugoslavia then before and they now have Africans and others showing up, doing what they do in Africa and the West.</p>
<p>I know the actual differences between Western and Eastern Socialism better than you do because I lived in it and observed history being made, with all the subtleties involved. You seem to be doing little more than attempting to bash egos with me because you make no clear references and resort to personal attacks as the introduction in your posts.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-223650" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I would like to know the reasons western governments are hell bent on importing 3rd world people on such a massive scale. I know it is deliberate, I know it is planned, but it seems to be a suicide pack to literally destroy the world. Do these white elite&rsquo;s think that once the rest of us whites are gone, they can rule the world with total impunity. Without us they have no money to spend. They can print like they do now, but eventually that will not be enough. Are they just plain stupid ? Are they brainwashed beyond help? Has the liberal mindset gotten to the point that they can&rsquo;t comphrehend cause and effect. Do they honestly think once WE are gone, the day to day tasks of society will magically work and everyone will live in harmony. Only gone beyond help liberals can believe this crap. And yes a great many of them do. </p>
<p>That they purposely cover up the crimes tells me either they know the course they have taken is totally out of control or they cover it up to keep it going a little longer. But why ? Why ? It is better to destroy the world, destroy your country, destroy your countrymen, destroy your future generations, or destroy your race because horrors of all horrors you are called a racist. As long as the world has people, we will have racism. It cannot be eradicated ever, nor should it be. Racism has been around since time began. It is survival of the fittest. The strong, the smart, the resourceful deserve and have earned the right to perpetuate humankind. Not the other way around. We are all racist, you can&rsquo;t help it. It is in your DNA. Don&rsquo;t feel bad about it, I certainly don&rsquo;t. Blacks are perhaps the most racist people in history, they discriminate against their own kind based on their level of blackness or browness skintone. Do whites do that to that degree&hellip; if at all. Asians are bigoted towards other asians. That will never change either. </p>
<p>Is the pull of communist totalitarianism so strong an influence in our government leaders and moneyed elite that this is the reason ? Is the desire of power so strong that our leaders are willing to sacrifice the future of humanity for a few extra dollars or pounds, or francs or yen ? Is it worth having innocent people raped, killed, or bankrupted just so they can feel better, just so they can have more power, just so they can control more of the&hellip;.. one and only life you have. Do you deserve this? I certainly don&rsquo;t. Why then do we put up with this? </p>
<p>In college (1970&#8242;s ) I made a comment that to a friend that in the future the United States would resemble the then current day communist USSR and the USSR would become more like then present day free and capitolist America. Damn I wish I was wrong on that one. I am not only one who saw this coming 40-50 years ago. The rise of liberalism is the root cause of the worlds problems. Liberalism perpetuates proverty and yes unbridled and unhealthy, bad racism. Todays liberalism is just a cloaked version of communist totalitarianism. Americans, Europeans, Canadians, Austrailians, Brits, and yes especially South Africans it is your duty and destiny to future mankind to stop this destruction and reverse this course before we don&rsquo;t have the numbers to save all humanity from itself. </p>
<p> Shall we start now?</p>

<p>Even China has embraced capitalism and has been beating the West at the game for some time now. They&rsquo;re smart enough to know that if they killed the system, they&rsquo;d go down, too. This is the very balance game that is going on right now. Of course, it will all collapse because the capitalist model requires continued expansion and limitless expansion is not possible. The farther we push the finite limits, such as population capacity, geography, biological integrity and resources, the harder the correction will be. It&rsquo;s a mathematical formula, a well established biological model of growth and decay in any closed system. The planet is such a closed biological system. The correction will come. No need for your apocalyptic Christian religion to pretend to it.</p>

<p>Religion, at least the big three, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, motivate by fear. Are you a man, or are you a sheep? That is the question. If we are truly free Western people, are we to be sheep? You ought to read up on the actual history of Christianity. The Christians killed more white Europeans asserting itself and caused more death via religious civil war in Europe than all the Muslims killing non-believers have by far (so far). It was only the moderating forces caused by the revival of Classic Western values (philosophy, science, reason) that ended this, even though it continued into the 19th century (even in the U.S.) and still simmers in Northern Ireland. No one can speak with any authority on the subject of Western civilization without reading Gibbon&rsquo;s &#8220;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&#8221; The first three volumes (of six) can be had in paperback for not too much at online booksellers. The next book I would recommend to anyone who wants to understand how the New Testament was written ought to read theologian Bart Ehrman&rsquo;s books, particularly, &#8220;Misquoting Jesus.&#8221; Studying the Albigensian Crusade is a great introduction into the foundation and activities of the Inquisition and the heretic and witch trials in general. The epic of the 14th century Black Plague was a defining event as well.</p>
<p>Then, at last, you may come to realize that the true Western culture, the one that gave white Europeans the means to grow and prosper and become the envied elites of all on earth was the Western tradition of philosophy.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-228832" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I agree, but only partly. There is a still a large contingent in the U.S. Congress that recognizes and supports ongoing U.S. wars (count up the few years that we haven&rsquo;t been in a war somewhere). This is because the general Military/Industrial Complex is still in place and members of both parties realize that if it was dismantled, they&rsquo;d be caught flatfooted as we were (pretty much) in WW2. It also provides a huge amount of jobs to people who would likely never find a place in the private sector. </p>
<p>I also recall how most the country continued to cut education funding, or destroyed them by insisting on integration, busing blacks into white schools, whites into black neighborhoods, etc. Education became indoctrination instead of learning. Education in &#8220;liberal arts&#8221; (the basic required education before a major or post grad work was allowed), colleges began eliminating it in favor of fast-tracking graduates into their respective fields. This was a major turning point in the U.S. Education system. Arguments to justify it such as that it was a waste of time to study the writings of &#8220;Old Dead White Men,&#8221; come to mind. Professor Alan Bloom wrote about this and it&rsquo;s likely result in his 1987 book, &#8220;The Closing of the American Mind.&#8221; The result hasn&rsquo;t been just the loss of the study of philosophy in ethics but the deeper cultural influences that defined Western culture for centuries. The American graduate became not an intellectual capable of depth in reasoning and critical thought, but a specialist. But specialists are more easily trained and so every sort of specialist, from the farm worker to the medical specialist, as been more easily replaced by cheap imported &#8220;specialists.&#8221; (I met a white couple in Washington State that tried to get a job picking apples and were told that they were not qualified by the Mexican foreman. I know that engineers in the Silicon Valley have been laid off because they are white, English speakers).</p>
<p>But this was as much due to conservatives as liberals. Both took part in destroying the U.S. educational system as a cultural vessel.</p>

It&rsquo;s why it was necessary for us to beat them to the moon, etc. The ironic part was that we became more like them with a huge number of civilian employees supporting the military. Conservatives in those days were motivated to support larger government and spending because most of their jobs depended upon it. This is why Reagan and both Bush&rsquo;s were so hawkish. The all volunteer military that was established in 1976 has become in effect, a Social State within the U.S. Blatant misrule and its consequences are still with us today and gave and gives the Left a huge amount of meat to chew on. The power vacuum it produced allowed the Civil Rights Movement and the Feminist Movement to grab ground and establish themselves as political determiners and become the direct enemy of whites and white males in particular.</p>

<p>A better question is: Why couldn&rsquo;t the USSR manage to produce prosperity, instead of wasting time on a failed ideology from the 19th century that caused the deaths of more people around the world in the 20th century than any other ideology in the history of the world combined.</p>

When the Soviets took over half of Europe they raped and pillaged like no German did when they conquered a country. And Russia was better then than today? You are insane.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-230105" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>When I read posts and replies like this, that show how barren the historical knowledge of so many whites has become, it proves to me how little hope there is for the white race and it really depresses me. The proof of what I said is as near as any history book or even any one of the many well sourced documentaries on WW2. The Germans were doing this BEFORE they allied with Japan and before December 7, 1941. We were sending food and supplies to England who WAS at war with Germany and they were sinking our merchant marine ships all along the Atlantic coast. To head off you next reactionary response, we were supplying Britain because Germany had invaded Poland and was threatening Britain with us next. German spies were at work in many major cities and subversive plots discovered - all well before the alliance was made with Japan.</p>
<p>You accuse me of insanity, but your entire statement lacks any cohesive fact or logic. If you project backwards retrospectively, then anything can be justified. Applying later history as a justification for previous history is the most flawed argument method there is. I don&rsquo;t agree with our misrule and misdeeds and have commented on it often on this very posting board over the years, but they do not justify past atrocity or aggression. You need to also understand the concept of historical epochs. The most celebrated 20th century historian (Carrol Quiqley) defined the 20th century as actually beginning in 1945 when the Atomic Age arrived. The historical epoch caused by that (The Cold War) has a separate history. Can you grasp the idea that WW1 and WW2 had causes that were all dependent results 19th century and previous era causes?</p>
<p>What the Nazi led Germans did in Eastern Europe and in Russia is well documented and this argument that Russians did worse than the Germans is a rotten lie with no historical evidence to support it, while piles of evidence prove the former. These are Neo-Nazi myths that no one, not even conservative historians buy. Must I remind you that Poland was invaded by Germany and that Russia (USSR) was invaded by Germany? Any history book would also inform you that the Allies would not have<br/>
won without the sacrifices of the Russians. In WW2 50 million people<br/>
died. One in three was a Russian. Germans killed them, no one else.<br/>
They wouldn&rsquo;t have won without our supplying them, but historians agree<br/>
that The Battle of Stalingrad was the main determiner of who won WW2 in<br/>
Europe. At that time, the Soviets were completely on their own. </p>
<p>Take a look at what Russia is like today. Even Russians advise people not to vacation there. It is a mess and violence is random and continuous; whites assaulting whites, crimes of all sorts, etc. But I was also referring to the fact that Africans and Muslims are present in Russia and other former Soviet Block nations now when they weren&rsquo;t during the Soviet period or during Yugoslavia&rsquo;s time and that is a threat to white survival in general. Russia was better off as a white nation with nationalism in place. I met one Russian woman at a crafts fair once selling amber jewelry. She said that today, Russia needs another Stalin. I was appalled. She said that every other Russian on the street in Moscow should be shot dead, meaning that was the ratio of criminals now there. It took me a while to understand why she would feel this way, but after seeing the Russian mafia at work in the Balkans, their involvement in bringing heroin into Europe, their brutal work as sex slavery of their own female children, etc., I understood what she meant. Stalin was awful, but after he cleaned up the country, law and order was established and the remaining people were safe. The same goes for Tito, who didn&rsquo;t have to be brutal at all. </p>
<p>Whites like you are useless. What the &#8220;H&#8221; do you think you are preserving? And carrying on the old political hatred of other white nations! With no knowledge of history and just an insistence on misinformed political mythology there is eventually no culture to preserve because lies are not culture. White ignorance of their own history and fabricating excuses for mistakes is just as suicidal as marrying non-whites or being a Tim Wise/SPLC supporter.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-228878" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Ever heard the term, &#8220;Useful Idiots?&#8221; </p>
<p>Nothing has been exaggerated or distorted. The main Feminist organization NOW made public addresses to women in the late 70s and 80s that white men were the cause of all evil in the world and that no white woman should bear the children of a white man. This has become generalized over time and re-enforced in the media and pop-culture. It&rsquo;s to the point now that many young women view dating and marrying non-white men as not only something normal to do, but an obligation if they want to be &#8220;in.&#8221; Lindsay Vonn is now dating Tiger Woods, a black (mix) with a terrible record as a serious partner likely because she sees herself as the next Heidi Klum. But in both cases, the two together are an aesthetic and genetic sin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Equal rights&#8221; for everybody? Where do you draw the line? Immigrants love coming here because they become instantly equal, maybe even &#8220;more equal&#8221; (see Orwells&rsquo; &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221;). Women got the vote and then voted in Prohibition (Volstead Act) that had the effect of helping establish the Mafia as the first truly organized crime syndicate in the U.S. As women &#8220;marched forward&#8221; miscegenation increased orphans and abortions increased. Some could argue that women were never meant to have &#8220;equal rights.&#8221; If you are a Christian, it&rsquo;s in your Bible, Eve is the one that brought the end of paradise on earth and women are &#8220;cursed.&#8221; Even though I am not a believer, the myth seems to have a great deal of truth to it. </p>
<p>&#8220;Equal Opportunity&#8221; is a program that was established as part of The Great Society reforms first announced by LBJ in the 1960s. EOE meant in practice that quotas of non-white men had to be fulfilled when anyone was being hired at any government or government contracted job. This was challenged but the way it was done was changed a little, not its effect. EO is a plan that is Marxist in its form because it represents a forced system with position given by political identity, not merit. Not only has it hurt the white population in the U.S., but its influence has spread all over the West. One of the ways that Feminist leaders saw a way to destroy white men is to support immigration. This was done before the huge flood began. Since then, new terms like &#8220;Diversity&#8221; and &#8220;Multiculturalism&#8221; have been invented for the coercive effect of asserting a non-white America or even West. To deny that Feminism is innocent of this is simply incorrect.</p>
<p>But what I see is committed feminists like Hilary Clinton opining that groups like Muslims can be changed. The conceit and limited vision of groups like the feminists have always existed. The Leftists in Europe were sure that they could bring in non-Whites and they&rsquo;d become Europeans by culture at least, never realizing that they were facing a force greater than their own. The first modern American Feminist writer Betty Friedan, who wrote The Feminine Mystique in the 1950s was later trying to halt the late 60s and 70s Feminists because she said that it was not at all what she intended. I know of a number of older feminists from that period that are now old and lonely, bemoaning that there has been no man in their lives (for very long). I actually found an article on that issue a while back. And ironically, if you look at her bio and those of leading fems like Gloria Steinem, Jane Fonda, etc., they are typically women with father issues, especially Friedan and Steinem (who were also Jews). I have noticed that the majority of outspoken early feminist were Jewish. When you see those photos of Gloria Steinem and Angela Davis withe their fists raised and all that hate on their faces, (Davis was a famous black activist) then you can begin to imagine the level of anti-male energy they represented and fostered back then.</p>
<p>If you want to be a white race realist and support the white race, then you must start by supporting white men being white men. You should believe in the basics of survival of any culture, that the men and women have roles to fulfill. The modern &#8220;equal&#8221; Western world has progressed to its potential for self-annihilation and Feminism has been a major causative feature of that.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-228845" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Wrong again! Islam is a religion based on the idea of commerce, as in slave trading. The very word, &#8220;Islam&#8221; means &#8220;submission.&#8221; Mohammad was a merchant (capitalist) and he invented a religion that would represent/justify a slave trading empire. This is why they did not destroy the cities or populations they conquered during the Arab Expansion. I don&rsquo;t see how this makes Islam the religious expression of Marxism. Do you really just apply &#8220;Marxist&#8221; to everything you are against?</p>
<p>However, Christianity IS an expression of Marxism and Marx used Christian principles in his ideas. If you knew the history of the early Church you would know that they practiced socialism before anyone else. Only Jewish aesthetic groups like the Essenes practiced communism before them. It&rsquo;s well documented in Edward Gibbon&rsquo;s &#8220;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&#8221; In its early days Christians absolutely expected the world to end at any moment. Rich as poor were converting in droves. The wealth of the rich was redistributed to the poorer converts. This ended up driving the conversion rate for quite a while. Later on, when the Egyptian monastic system took over, the Church began to collect from their flock and distribute among themselves. As I wrote you earlier, if Jesus collecting a few fishes and loaves of bread and redistributing them to a larger mass of people isn&rsquo;t the very description of collectivism/Marxism, then give me your best example. That&rsquo;s it, in it&rsquo;s simplest form.</p>

<p>Cool, that&rsquo;s like our government is hyperventilating over AR-15s, which are almost never used in crime, while it can&rsquo;t breath a word about the endless bloodbath of crimes committed by our millions of Trayvons. Our government also is on a jihad against domestic violence in cases where the perpetrator is a white male, even in situations where it was a light touch with no damage, or a shouting match, while it lets Kimanis back on the street with no consequences after committing all kinds of crimes.</p>
<p>Glad to see the US isn&rsquo;t the only country that will do anything and everything to whites rather than confront reality. Also glad to see we&rsquo;re importing boatloads more of Somalis and Haitians, because to <i>not</i> import them is to admit that there&rsquo;s some reason we might not want them here.</p>

We can name our friends and foes, then frame the relation between them. We as narrators are behind the scene, not drawing attention to ourselves. This is how we can deflect the MSM&rsquo;s bias-make THEM defend OUR enemies. As there is no defense for self evident malice the media would be presented a dilemna: Do we defend cruelty, or ignore sympathetic victims? The facts are so overwhelmingly on our side that any attempt to lie and deny their way out of this by the PC would, at length, be doomed to the crying wolf response.</p>

<p>That seems hard to believe. How are Muslims less likely to be victimized than French natives? They live in much worse neighborhoods and one would think that, like the blacks here, they commit crime against each other most often. How are homosexuals a hundred times less likely to be victimized than normal frenchmen?</p>

Is the life of a homosexual, a Jew, a crime-prone Negro shot by the police of such value to libs   &mdash;   while white kids set on fire are NOBODY? I&rsquo;m sorry to say the answer looks like it is a big fat yes. No billboards or buttons for them. The gays are certainly wealthy - just look at their lobby. And yes, they can afford the very best neighborhoods with the trendiest of everything and nary a black person in sight. Or one who comes in on the bus to clean their house and leaves for the ghetto on the 4 o&rsquo;clock bus. You know, I&rsquo;m just a white mom too, and I would say that the homos at this point in our history, are seen as more important than we are because after all, we are only raising the next generation of white hillbilly racists.</p>

When I was in college 20 years ago the politicization of this university culture was well underway. Now political correctness has fully metastasized and spread to society as a whole. It is the air these people breathe, and many of them don&rsquo;t know anything different.</p>
<p>When I look around online I&rsquo;m dumbstruck by what these people consider racism, homophobia, sexism, transphobia, this-phobia, that-phobia. The slightest perceived offense can set them off. And I&rsquo;m stunned by how hysterical and emotionally violent their reactions are. But the reactions go beyond angry online rants. I&rsquo;ve heard that SJWs (Social Justice Warriors) on Tumblr track people down for these imagined offenses, hack their accounts to get their personal information, and then use that info to try to destroy them however they can. They are the shock troops of the Left, and in their own way they&rsquo;re as ruthlessly and violently sociopathic as the Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have anything remotely like that going on. One simple thing to try is to go to sites like YouTube and find users that promote radical agendas or sites that attack people like us-race realists, anti-Leftists, etc. Then go to their videos and click on the flag icon to report them as offensive. It&rsquo;s a small thing, but it can distract and disrupt them temporarily.</p>

<p>You are projecting black behaviors on Muslims. Blacks attack anything and everything, including themselves. Muslims attack anything and everything not Muslim. The few cases of Muslim on Muslim violence are quickly buried in their secretive society. It matters little, though, as both pose a nearly equal threat to any white in relatively close proximity.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are homosexuals a hundred times less likely to be victimized than normal frenchmen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Homosexuals generally live it upper class white areas, safe from would be aggressors. Homosexuals are under no delusion that they would be treated decently in a majority black and/or Muslim area. Have no doubts about it&hellip;when there are no longer white neighborhoods to safely hide in, the homosexuals will find their lives a living h*ll&hellip;at least for the short time they will be allowed to draw breath.</p>

Shiites killed by Sunni and vice versa. These killings reached their peak in the US invasion of Iraq. Yes they hate infidels aka, nonbelievers, and will take every opportunity to victimize them. But they also exploit things which would be seen as an insult to the Quran, such as drug dealing, pandering prostitution, making of pornographic films, fornicating with infidel women, and selling alcohol. They are big hypocrites but that unfortunately is a human trademark which is difficult to remove. I believe MORE faith is needed by Americans to overcome our challenges. I have nothing against atheists. My father is one, and I love him dearly. But a large percentage of people need to reach out to a higher power in their lives. The trick is to get these people to reach out in the good times and be grateful, as well as in bad times, when they are in need. </p>

<p>The point I&rsquo;m making and ATBOTL made right here is that thanks to the multi-partisan political cultures found in continental European countries, and too that almost all European countries are at least in theory indicative of a given ethnicity (an ethnostate), white nationalist politics or ethnopolitics are far closer to carrying the day and solving the problems in continental Europe than they are here, even though the problem seems more far gone in countries like France. Then again, that&rsquo;s a reason in itself   &mdash;   Patterson&rsquo;s First Axiom.</p>

<p>France has a nationalist political party that wins about 20% of the vote and many other nationalist groups that have the support of a large share of the French people. America has virtually nothing. We are the rotting corpse. Europe is moving in the right direction politically America is the country where the &#8220;right&#8221; is pushing to amnesty illegals and flood the country with 3rd world &#8220;guest workers.&#8221; Our country is by far the most degenerate Western country.</p>

It was really embarrassing. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re ever told the real story about what&rsquo;s going on in other places. In fact, for a long time our media has tried very hard to put blinders on us so they can keep pouring &#8220;Freedom freedom freedom&#8221; koolaid into our mouths. It is actually a very obnoxiously UNFREE society these days, if you stroll around any city in Europe it&rsquo;s not half as monitored as we are here. Excepting Britain, of course where every lip movement and iris are recorded and scanned. You can hardly light cigarettes in fanatically liberal NY anywhere without dirty looks almost as bad as the ones given to racists. I gave up smoking a long time ago, but never got used to people acting like cops about cigarettes - when I was growing up both my parents smoked, I think all the parents on my block smoked. Sure it was bad for health, but they shouldn&rsquo;t be treated like an axe murderer. Smoking pot is of course, admirable. Mother Nature, you know. What about this martinet of a mayor we have here? He doesn&rsquo;t care about violent boons destroying historic Brooklyn because he&rsquo;s busy worrying about 16 ounces of soda servings. What in the world is up with these dictators?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-225714" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Comparing muslims in Europe to Mexicans in the USA is like comparing apples and oranges. The situation is very different in many ways. The problem in the USA is that Mexicans are not nearly as bad as muslims, as a matter of fact, Mexicans are far better than muslims. As such, they are not nearly the threat to Americans that muslims are to europeans. Muslims are completely and totally different from europeans, both racially, culturally, religiously and in the way they govern. Muslims are also very militant and target european. Mexicans, on the other hand, being of mixed european(Spaniard) culture, are much more similar to Americans/Europeans. Mexicans are christian and celebrate christmas/easter etc. There is little religious extremism among Mexicans nor is &#8220;religious terrorism&#8221; a problem with them. Mexico is democracy that has freedom of religion and speech and separation of church/state. Mexicans are racially a european/amerind mix and speak a european language. Mexicans don&rsquo;t have more than one wife, things like Sharia law, don&rsquo;t believe in women wearing burqas or have the extreme attitudes towards women that muslims have. Mexicans blend in much better with much less disruption than muslims, as such, Americans don&rsquo;t have the urgency to form nationalist parties like europeans do. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, even though Mexican immigration absolutely should be stopped and reversed and Americans need to rise up and do this, the situation with muslims is far worse.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-223550" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Just a tip here.<br/>
I was anti Twitter (social media) for the longest time until just recently.<br/>
I saw it as being similar to Facebook, you know people who you have sometimes the weakest (or outdated ) connection to, trying to be funny (when they&rsquo;re not), trying to make the mundane aspects of life sound interesting (when they&rsquo;re not), or they try to project out &#8216;pop philosophy&rsquo; type of advice (when their own lives are an empty mess demonstrated by how much time they spend on FB), or reinforcing a hive mind mentality with the spoon fed social &amp; political stories of the day etc. etc.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;ve finally clicked to Twitter&rsquo;s potential, for instances as a unilingual guy myself I can follow people such as:<br/>
Marine Le Pen (French speaking)<br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/MLP_officiel" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/MLP_officiel</a></p>
<p>Dan Roodt (Afrikaans &amp; English)<br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/danroodt" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/danroodt</a> or<br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/pro_afrikaans" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/pro_afrikaans</a></p>
<p>Claude Theriault (French)<br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/Claude2052" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/Claude2052</a></p>
<p>Geert Wilders (Dutch)<br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv</a></p>
<p>Then in Google chrome (I appreciate there are privacy/tracking issues), you just right click and &#8220;translate to English&#8221;, then you&rsquo;re part of the conversation, it&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>Also all the other Right Wing sites that most Amreners frequently mention (Vdare, Taki mag, Alt Right, RT news etc&hellip;and then the individual authors too), instead of tweeting useless platitudes, link URL&rsquo;s to fresh articles or news stories that the MSM ignores.</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree. The tiresome rhetoric about the cowardly French and/or Canadians grows monotonous, does it not? Is it any wonder we cannot seem to unite and stand with each other? We are busy counting each others pimples as our enemies count our graves. Priceless.</p>

<p>The second thing is obvious which is to stop the flow of Africans and Middle Easterners into the country. This is harder, because of all of the backlash that it would ensue.</p>
<p>Before any of this happens, though, the Euro and possibly even the European Union will have to be replaced.</p>
<p>Tough times lie ahead for France, no doubt. Britain has it better as they are an island, and Italy and Germany because of their culture and history.</p>
<p>As for America, the only thing going for it is space and resources. America is possibly the most deluded of the bunch.</p>

And the only way they can be defunded is for economic collapse to occur where all government is so weakened by a lack of revenue it can do nothing better than to sustain itself in areas of vital necessity.</p>
<p>In the process of all that, social programs will fall by the side as well, creating mass uprisings by third world hordes, which will cause repercussions by the white majority. And any attempt by the government to intervene will be met with overwhelming forces who have lost most everything and have nothing else to lose.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-223999" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Clockwork Orange is an interesting movie, and I think worth watching for white advocates. Stanley Kubrick, the films director, was right about one thing. The world would become more violent and not less violent. </p>
<p> To sum up the movie (and in my opinion it is more a parable, or it tells a hidden story more than anything else). In the movie &#8216;Alex&rsquo; the main character in the film, behaves badly, pillaging and plundering. The authorities in the movie decide &#8216;alex&rsquo; needs to be cured, so he&rsquo;s forced to watch Nazi war atrocities on a movie screen while being recondition. After Alex is &#8216;cured&rsquo; and he&rsquo;s made to be anti-violent he&rsquo;s then horribly abused by each party he had done wrong to in the past, and he&rsquo;s unable to defend himself from them. </p>
<p>The story in the film sounds a bit like the people in France in the article who are unable to speak up for themselves or find their voice. That&rsquo;s exactly what the film meant to portray, in my opinion.</p>
<p>There was a literary work from the 1960&#8242;s, a Sci Fi story titled, With the Bentfin Boomer Boys on Little Old New Alabama. It was about a war between a colony of whites on New Alabama at war with a colony of blacks on New Haiti. The Haitians in the story called the whites &#8216;Blancs&rsquo; kind of like a racial slur. I was never sure, before reading the story above, where the word came from. I don&rsquo;t speak French.</p>

One hundred fifty years ago, the criminal, drugged ethnicity that all Native Americans despised - not excluding the slaves themselves - where the millions of fugitive Irish fleeing the greatest famine the English speaking peoples have ever known, Yet, the Irish became useful, law abiding members of society, and saw one of their own, John Kennedy, become their own. The Negroes were once law abiding, useful members of society who have become a criminal, drugged class that Native Americans dislike - even if they don&rsquo;t say so. I put it too you that the Great Society and its metastasis is the cause. This is not how Liberalism started, but it is all that is left of it now.Lyndon Johnson conceived, and Nixon executed, the plan which rewarded vice, and punished virtue. The cure consists in reversing the incentives. Stupid people are not necessary immoral, and any person can acquire moral sense. The opposite seems more likely - the intellectual elites seems to be our new tyrants. Morals are no more a function of intellect that Physics is of religious/ethnic origin. This criticism of Black behavior is, I suggest, more accurate and damning than race base explanation. People are not born evil, but they ca be encouraged to it. So it happened here.</p>

I can relate that everything written here is true and actually reality is even worse that what u can imagine reading this article. I miss the words to say how much the majority of French people are zombified with the jewish-leftist politically correct one-track-thinking. So I really think there are only two solutions: </p>
<p>1. France will disapear in about 30 years (or less) and be replaced by an islamic republic. </p>
<p>2. A major economical crisis will occur within the next 6 years and the zombies we call French people will wake up once they have no money left.</p>
<p>I hope the second hypothesis will happen. The future will tell.</p>

The third worlders of course vote for socialism/handouts/perpetual special (victim) status. </p>

There are people who live in ideal- romantic view of the world, they either know or do not know what other races are like but they are the ones who destroy Europe intentionally or not.<br/>
Last and not least, prepare for war. It is not us, white people who will start the war, we will want to remove these people peacefully, but they have nothing at stake and will start murdering us no matter if we leave them alone ( South Africa and Zimbabwe are the best examples), accept them or try to kick out.

The closure was motivated by a strike of the staff to protest against the harassment they have to endure at the hands of young gypsy thieves loitering in the galleries and mugging visitors. Best thing is though that these thugs are getting into the museum free of charge, courtesy of the French government which provides free entry to people under the age of 18. It has become a sad and common sight on French streets to see gypsy women begging with toddlers in their arms by freezing cold.</p>
