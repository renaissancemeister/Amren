Vice Magazine ventures into Liberia.</div> 
</div> 


<p>Joseph Conrad&rsquo;s classic novella <i>Heart of Darkness </i>depicts Africa as a continent of primordial darkness where savage impulses reign. <i>H</i><i>eart of Darkness </i>was published in 1899, but <i>The Vice Guide to Liberia</i> presents a similarly brutal image of the Dark Continent, except that the darkness has crept out of the jungle into the dilapidated cities. This is not a really a travel guide, however; it is a deliberate search for degeneracy.</p>
<p>Degeneracy is easy to find in Liberia, which is a particularly wretched place, even for Africa. It is a country where underage hookers sell their bodies for less than a dollar to feed their drug addictions, and where cannibal warlords transform themselves into evangelical preachers overnight. The film is reminiscent of a documentary made in the 1960s, <i>Africa Addio</i>. Both show aspects of Africa the West refuses to see, and suggest how difficult it is for Africans to manage a Western-style state.</p>
<p>The <i>Guide to Liberia</i> is part of <i>Vice Magazine</i>&rsquo;s series that documents the worst countries in the world &mdash; there are <i>Vice</i> guides to North Korea and Lebanon. The <i>Guide to Liberia </i>is arguably the most politically incorrect.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ViceGuide.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103513" alt="ViceGuide" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ViceGuide.jpg" width="500" height="375"/></a></p>
<p>All of the guides follow <i>Vice </i>personnel as they tramp their way into the unknown, and this one stars <i>Vice Magazine </i>co-founder Shane Smith. In the opening scene, Mr. Smith is wading through a river with a former warlord known as General Butt Naked, who tells Mr. Smith how he earned his <i>nom de guerre</i>: He and his troops went into battle completely naked in order to terrify their enemies, and as a sign that bullets could not touch them. Gen. Butt Naked, whose troops reportedly killed more than 20,000 people, also describes how his men would kill a child and drink his blood as a pre-battle ritual. The guide then cuts to a clip of a child soldier holding up a human heart, boasting that he is about to eat it.</p>
<div id="attachment_103514" style="width: 478px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/GenButtNaked.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-103514" alt="Gen. Butt Naked threatens a fellow soldier with a knife in 1996." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/GenButtNaked.jpg" width="468" height="267"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gen. Butt Naked threatens a fellow soldier with a knife in 1996.</p></div>
<p>Mr. Smith then gives us a history lesson. Liberia was founded by American abolitionists as a haven for freed slaves who wanted to return to their home continent. Many abolitionists, including Abraham Lincoln, promoted repatriation but it was not popular among blacks; <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2003/07/was_liberia_founded_by_freed_us_slaves.html">only 13,000</a> made the journey.</p>
<p>The ex-slaves who did return to Africa brought ideas from their former masters: They enslaved the natives and established a society like that of the antebellum South. The descendents of slaves, known as Americo-Liberians, continued to dominate Liberia until 1980, when Samuel Doe, one of the &ldquo;aborigines,&rdquo; as the former American slaves called them, took power in a coup that left the president and dozens of top government officials dead. A decade later, a rebellion led by Charles Taylor toppled Doe. Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s father was an Americo-Liberian, and Charles earned a degree at Bentley College in Massachusetts in 1977. At one time he worked for the Doe regime, but was fired for embezzlement.</p>
<p>Doe was captured by an ally of Mr. Taylor, Prince Johnson, who tortured and killed Doe before cutting up his body and giving the parts to his men to eat. The torture was filmed and distributed to media, recording that Mr. Johnson sipped Budweiser as his men sliced off Doe&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<div id="attachment_103555" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SamuelDoe.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-103555 " alt="Samuel Doe with US Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger outside the Pentagon in 1982." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SamuelDoe.jpg" width="574" height="372"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Samuel Doe with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger outside the Pentagon in 1982.</p></div>
<p>After Doe&rsquo;s fall, Liberia became a playground for dozens of warlords who fought each other over petty swaths of land. Eventually, they reached a peace agreement and there were elections in 1997. Mr. Taylor won, with the campaign slogan: &ldquo;He killed my ma, He killed my pa, but I will vote for him.&rdquo; Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s rule was marked by generalized chaos, and came to an end in 2003 when mounting foreign pressure forced him out. In 2012, Mr. Taylor was convicted of war crimes by a UN tribunal condemned to 50 years in prison. Since Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s exit, Liberia has enjoyed relative stability, though the country is still overrun with &ldquo;veterans&rdquo; of decades of war and has an estimated unemployment rate of 80 percent.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith meets a white journalist who will help him find former warlords who still have influence among their followers. They have names such as General Mosquito, after the insect that spreads malaria; Gen. Mosquito&rsquo;s rival was called General Mosquito Spray. Liberians think these are fearsome names.</p>
<p>The journalist leads Mr. Smith to a warlord known as General Bin Laden, but he is locked up in a slum called Baboon Town. Mr. Smith learns he must spring Gen. Bin Laden from jail in order to interview him, but this is easily done by bribing the jail chief.</p>
<p>Gen. Bin Laden seems young for a former war lord: He looks to be only in his twenties. He takes Mr. Smith and his crew to his gang stronghold, where they are soon surrounded by a curious crowd. Mr. Bin Laden explains that the warlords are now community leaders, and provide valuable services to the people. As an example of his community service, Mr. Bin Laden says he teaches karate to the people of Baboon Town.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith has to cut the interview short; the crowd is growing, and seems to think he is a white foreigner with plenty of money to dole out. The <i>Vice</i> crew makes its way back to downtown Monrovia, and finds a Liberian journalist who shows them around.</p>
<p>The journalist takes the crew to the worst slum in the country, West Point. The streets are open sewers, piled with garbage and human feces; the stench is overwhelming. The journalist explains that the slum was devastated by the war and that its residents do not use toilets. Instead, they use the nearby beach. The beach is covered with trash and human waste, but children scamper about, seemingly undisturbed. When Mr. Smith notes that &ldquo;one of the first basic rules is &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t shit where you eat&rsquo;,&rdquo; the Liberian replies that even the commissioner of the district &ldquo;squats and shits with the people.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_103517" style="width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WestPoint.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-103517" alt="West Point, Monrovia." src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WestPoint.jpg" width="540" height="360"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">West Point, Monrovia.</p></div>
<p>Mr. Smith notes the influence of black American culture on the Liberians &mdash; many of the children wear American basketball jerseys and Tupac shirts. An aspiring rapper does a song for the crew about AIDS, that includes the line: &ldquo;What type of sickness kills everybody? AIDS!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crew goes to a heroin den and finds a young boy who spends all his money there. He says he raped a &ldquo;big-belly woman&rdquo; and stole her money. &ldquo;Break noses, break teeth, cut ears . . . what else are we going to do for money?&rdquo; he asks.</p>
<p>The journalist takes the <i>Vice</i> crew to a West Point brothel where prostitutes offer sex for less than one US dollar. The brothel is strewn with used condoms and blood. The prostitutes say the UN troops and officials beat them, and have sex with small children. One prostitue appears to be pregnant, while another one is clearly drugged. She starts screaming for money, which draws a crowd that also starts screaming for money. Mr. Smith and his crew escape.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith recounts some sobering statistics: Liberia is the world&rsquo;s fourth poorest country, half the country is illiterate, seventy percent of Liberian women have been raped, and many Liberians have eaten human meat. The film then cuts to a child soldier from the civil war saying how much he likes human flesh, while other soldiers cut organs from a dead body.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/LiberiaRapeBillboard.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103556" alt="Monrovia Billboard" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/LiberiaRapeBillboard.jpg" width="490" height="326"/></a></p>
<p>Mr. Smith meets a warlord named General Rambo who says that during the civil wars, local merchants drove wagons of human meat through the city and sold it to residents. He claims he talked to the American government about sending his band of soldiers to fight in Iraq. He says the plan was scrapped, but Gen. Rambo said that he felt Liberians were &ldquo;the reserve troops of America,&rdquo; and that he wanted to fight for the US. He says Liberia could quickly erupt into civil war because jungle-dwelling rebels are still heavily armed. He says only the UN keeps the rebels from attacking.</p>
<p>The film returns to General Butt Naked, who says his real name is Joshua Blahyi. He had recently been pardoned for war crimes by a Liberian commission because of his conversion to Christianity, but he had nevertheless just survived an assassination attempt. Mr. Blahyi is now a suit-wearing preacher rather than a nude cannibal warlord. He cuts an imposing figure. He is significantly bigger than the other Liberians in the film, most of whom look weak and emaciated.</p>
<p>Mr. Blahyi takes the crew to his old stronghold where he describes, in detail, his pre-battle routine of killing a child. He says they would stab the child through the back, rip out the heart, cut it into pieces, and feed them to the soldiers. He believed this made them braver during battle. He says he also gave them drugs to make them brave and keep them loyal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cannibalism.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-103518" alt="Cannibalism" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cannibalism.jpg" width="558" height="396"/></a></p>
<p>During one such sacrifice, Mr. Blahyi claims he saw an angelic figure urging him to accept Jesus Christ or face death. His gun jammed during the battle, which he took as a sign that he needed to change his ways. He says not all Liberians believe his conversion story, and adds that he has trouble escaping violence because there have been many attempts on his life.</p>
<p>One of the men at Blahyi&rsquo;s mission<b> </b>was a rival warlord of General Butt Naked. He says he was left with nothing after the fighting, and had to go to a cemetery for shelter. This is common in Liberia, and Mr. Blahyi takes Mr. Smith and his crew to a cemetery to observe this disturbing trend. Mr. Blahyi says homeless veterans dig the bodies out of the graves, where they live. Mr. Smith says an estimated 4,000 people have lived in graves in Liberia.</p>
<p>Mr. Blahyi says he is never sure about eating meat because it might be human flesh. He recognizes the taste of human meat, and a cut he recently ate that turned out to be human. He says that when he was a cannibal, he preferred meat from the back.</p>
<p>The rest of the guide follows Mr. Blahyi&rsquo;s career as an evangelist. He gives a rousing sermon, and leads the congregation in uplifting songs that sound like rock and roll. Mr. Smith is asked to speak to the congregation, and he congratulates Mr. Blahyi on the &ldquo;good work&rdquo; he is doing. Mr. Blahyi comes across as very charismatic and likeable, despite his record. Mr. Smith confesses that his cordial relationship with Mr. Blahyi may be a case of Stockholm syndrome. Still, he wonders if Mr. Blahyi will stick with Christianity or go back to being General Butt Naked.</p>

<p>The <i>Vice</i> <i>Guide to Liberia</i> is clearly meant to appeal to young viewers who enjoy humor and don&rsquo;t mind profanity. It treats Liberia&rsquo;s problems seriously, but never hints that they are the West&rsquo;s fault or that the world owes Liberia anything. What the guide shows are no doubt the most disturbing and incongruous images Mr. Smith could find, but a continent that can produce scenes such as these is one that is unlikely to produce anything that could be called a civilization.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-228695" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This shows how black behavior is the same, everywhere. What is shown in this documentary is pretty much the same as what we see in the inner cities of America, or the whole country of Haiti, or pretty much anywhere else on this earth where blacks are &#8220;themselves&#8221;. Living in white countries they have, until recently, felt compelled to live under what they consider to be the &#8220;restraints&#8221; of white society. Of course, these are not constraints to white people, they are accepted norms. Blacks have a discord or conflict between their true nature and the norms of white societies. They hate &#8220;whiteness&#8221;. They quite correctly recognize that it is fundamentally different from the nature they were born with. What we see in this documentary is the same nature and mind that perpetrated the gratuitous slaughter of a white one year old in a stroller in Brunswick Georgia. <a href="http://www.news4jax.com/news/Mother-of-slain-toddler-talks-about-shooting/-/475880/19425780/-/gn0unsz/-/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.news4jax.com/news/Mother-of-slain-toddler-talks-about-shooting/-/475880/19425780/-/gn0unsz/-/index.html</a></p>
<p>What we see is why segregation existed, and why we need it to be brought back. Human beings need to be able to be safe from the animals.</p>

He&rsquo;s far from the only part of the media that does this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/should-race-play-a-role-how-the-media-reports-crime" rel="nofollow">http://www.examiner.com/article/should-race-play-a-role-how-the-media-reports-crime</a></p>
<p>There certainly are trashy whites; we simply have a (much, much) smaller proportion of our population that are lumpen. And of course the poorest of whites were once kept in line by middle class attitudes as well. But now violent, high school dropout rappers such as Eminem and Insane Clown Posse are promoted as their heroes.</p>
<p>Also why is AmRen only now getting around to VICE&rsquo;s videos? I saw this video in August, way to keep tabs on the pulse of the internet and youth culture. (Knowing what youth are watching is vital to advancing the white cause)</p>

<p>Why do Black Leaders take on the mantle of preachers? Why are preachers so respected in the black community? Why are they the voice of the black people?</p>
<p>Black preachers in America call themselves by names that invoke the Prophet. A prophet claims to speak with the voice of God. Therefore black preachers claim to speak for God. As God&rsquo;s voice, they promise their people liberation. Liberation from what? Oppression.</p>
<p>What is oppression? Oppression is whatever prevents one from attaining the goals they imagine and from enjoying the rewards to which they think they are entitled. Freedom is the experience of enjoying those rewards without interference.</p>
<p>Blacks imagine that they are entitled to many things as befits so noble a people. They imagine that oppression by the White Race is all that stands between them and that enjoyment. Black preachers promise them liberation from their travails and FREEDOM. This is an intoxicating message.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is impossible and unrealistic. There are only degrees of freedom, no unconditional freedom. The promise of FREEDOM is a cruel illusion but it has immense appeal. Any person who promises you the cruel illusion of FREEDOM is a sham. All Black Preachers who pretend to speak with the voice of God are shams and all black people who submit to their schemes are fools.</p>

They jump up and down, scream, dance, chant etc. Before the antebellum south and the corruption of some branches of christianity by association with africans, Christian church services were not highly emotionalized, frenzied events. The music was one that was calm, peaceful, and brought people to a higher state of consciousness by de-emotionalising them. In fact, in the very beginning so the church, music was not allowed at all. The nature of the religion was to be INTROspective,reflective, meditative. The preachers may have given fiery sermons but the parishoners were not all yelling and screaming and chiming in. Blacks behave this exact same way when they go to the movies. They sit in the audience and yell and scream things in response to the dialogue in the film.White christianity is about letting go of the ego self while black christians go to church for ego glorification, for engaging in a desperate one upsmanship game of acting out to get the most attention, to be the one who praises &#8220;Jeebus&#8221; the loudest, to be the one who is the most obsequious. They believe they can fool God into thinking they are to be favored above all the others in the church because of the behavior they display. It is a mad scramble amongst them all for imagined power over all the rest.</p>

<p>Really? Study history. The most educated in our past both in America and in Europe were the theologians, who also made a vast amount of the scientific and mathematical discoveries that benefit us today. Read the &#8220;Discoverers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even those that were not clergy, like Newton, based their drive to learn and discover on finding out more about God and how he made the world.</p>

Blacks in power tend to give themselves grandiose titles, and pretending that they are prophets and making up their own religions seems to me to be along the same lines. There&rsquo;s nothing higher than God, so if you can fool people that you speak for Him, you can get a lot of power and prestige. Not many people can fool a lot of whites into thinking they&rsquo;re prophets, but blacks tend to be more credulous.</p>

The implication was that American blacks would be liberated from the shackles of white racism by their black brothers in Africa.</p>
<p>No one who thinks thinks that way any more. Because blacks and their white apologists cannot take pride in Africa they hope the topic does not come up, and try to punish those who raise it.</p>

The road systems are almost gone. Journeys between towns that required only a few hours only two decades ago now require DAYS of travel . Whole mining towns now lay abandoned as there is no way to transport the ores from the mines to anywhere else. The sewerage system in cities no longer operate. Even wells that were constructed by western aid groups just a few years ago were never maintained and none of them work anymore. It has all just crumbled. The blacks are more interested in committing violence against each other and eating each other. They show that it is a genetic trait of the black race to live for nothing else besides the degradation and violation of others. The simplest tasks of maintaing what was left to them interested them not the slightest. They live for violence, nothing else, and this is consistent in all black societies around the world. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-229709" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>a multiracial individual, </p>
<p>that is an intriguing question. I hope my answer is worthy of it. </p>
<p>I really do not have any sympathy for blacks and Hispanics in the sense that I think whites are responsible for their lower average IQs and higher rates of crime. I attribute these characteristics to their greater proximity to a paleolithic way of life. </p>
<p>During the paleolithic and even the neolithic era a much higher percentage of men were killed in fighting between hunting bands and tribes. The best warriors had more than one wife, and consequently more sons who inherited their skill in killing, and their propensity to kill. </p>
<p>In an urban civilization there is division of labor. Warfare becomes a specialty, rather than something that is expected of all men. Physically aggressive men are attracted to the military, or they become criminals. In either field they become less prolific, rather than more so. </p>
<p>What matters in urban civilization is superior intelligence. Intelligent men tend to become prosperous, and to have more children who survive and reproduce.</p>
<p>With welfare, late marriages among professionals, and so on, it may not seem that what I have written is the way things are. I am thinking in terms of what has usually happened in history. </p>
<p>Over the centuries and thousands of years civilization has selected for intelligence, and against an inclination toward violent crime. </p>
<p>Whites and Orientals began agriculture about ten thousand years ago, and civilization about five thousand years ago. American Indians began agriculture about five thousand years ago, and civilization less than three thousand years ago. Negroes began agriculture about four thousand years ago. Large numbers of them only began living in cities during the twentieth century. </p>
<p>Hispanics are a hybrid race composed of whites, American Indians, and Negroes. </p>
<p>All of this explains why whites and Orientals have higher average IQs and lower crime rates than Hispanics, who have higher average IQs and lower crime rates than blacks.</p>
<p>I never encountered the term &#8220;race realist&#8221; until I discovered the writings of Jared Taylor and this website two and a half years ago, but yes I am a race realist. By this I mean that I think racial differences in average ability levels and behavior are significant, and due to different population pressures lasting for long periods of time, rather than to different environments. </p>
<p>Before I thought of myself as a race realist I though of myself as a genetic determinist, in that I thought (and still obviously think) that genetics is considerably more important than any other factor in determining not only ability levels, but also personality and character. </p>
<p>I will not dislike a person because of that person&rsquo;s race. </p>
<p>I hope this answers your question.</p>

They had a more advanced civilization than their neighbors prior to colonization as well. There are certainly other groups (Hausa, Fulani, et c) with some white blood from long ago. Hausa, Fulani, and Igbo are three of the biggest tribes in Nigeria, which, I suspect, is why Nigeria is less of a mess than other West African countries and why we can import a fair number of successful Nigerians.</p>

I think the final answer is very strongly segregation of various groupings of blacks, maybe of Mexicans in the US too. And whites. Also getting into society as a whole the idea that segregation is gooood.<br/>
There are a number of blacks who are very good people. But sex being what it is, segregation is necessary for the preservation of whites (and the preservation of other groups who want preservation.)<br/>
Within each grouping, there would be allowed a large amount of freedom of whatever kind the group wanted. And maybe some contractual arrangement with the white groups or whatever. But segregation definitely and with certain agreed upon channels of interaction, and no guilt for having segregation, provided it is not drain on whites the way it is today.</p>
<p>Morality of a fair number of whites will not allow mass harm to good blacks.</p>

And most of us, on all sides of the fence, don&rsquo;t. The appropriate course of action would have been for slavery to have never been allowed, or once established it should have been curtailed and phased out with freed slaves repatriated to Liberia.</p>
<p>The races living together has proved over and over again, that there is very limited capacity for compatibility or harmony. This is true in neighborhoods, schools, employment, politics, military and prisons. You name it.</p>
<p>Intelligent men who were giants of the 18th and 19th centuries noted time and again that the races were not equal and could not live together. Now such talk is deemed racist but it is pure realism, just check any crime stats.</p>
<p>Clearly, blacks enjoy the company of other blacks and that is perfectly normal. People like people who are similar to them in culture, appearance and temperament, but if a White says something like this in the Liberal world we are immediately ostracized.</p>
<p>People should live among whom they please. Integration would probably happen at a natural limited pace but when forced by Government and Liberal social pressure the outcome is always disaster. Even the French and English in Canada have difficulties living together and want to separate..</p>
<p>Common sense has been abandoned and practically outlawed. I fear the only solution will be a major race war or some form of social upheaval. </p>

<p>One side says racism is born from a lack of knowing good individuals, proving generalities to be wrong, and realizing that all people are equal.</p>
<p>Another side says racism is born from the interaction with many bad individuals which then formulate an accurate assessment of a group, along with the eventual strife when multiple groups live in close proximity, realizing that not all people are equal.</p>

I think largely homogeneous countries fare the best, but you can certainly assimilate a small minority into a majority. We do not need to purge our country of decent people just because they are black. Having policies that deal with chronic unemployment and crime instead of encouraging it, and keep the country united under one culture, should be enough to salvage the situation. I am very worried we will go from &#8220;black and white people average the same on absolutely everything, and if you contradict this you&rsquo;re EVIL!&#8221; to &#8220;there&rsquo;s no good in any black people, and they&rsquo;re all worthless&#8221;.

I remember reading that one reason Charles Murray was so upset with the hugely negative media response to the Bell Curve was not because he was vilified but because he thought the longer it took people to accept that IQ mattered and that the races had different averages, the more resentment would build up against blacks and the worse it would be for blacks when the dam burst and the resentment started pouring out.<br/>
I really agree with this. Whites as a group are slowly getting angrier at blacks as a group, and whites are having an extremely long fuse about it but the longer the government and media try to force the fuse to be, the worse the explosion will be for blacks when it blows.</p>

First, blacks would be stripped of all political rights, accept in black towns where they could serve as mayors or hold other such positions. Blacks that want to go back to Africa could be given a bit of help in doing so. Blacks that do not wish to be sent to Africa could stay here provided that they are sterilized so that they cannot reproduce, and simply live out their lives here in peace. After a generation or so the problem would be solved without a lot of pain. Blacks that commit serious crimes would be sent to Africa or killed.</p>

Crime, rape, drugs, waste, fraud, poverty and corruption have already crept in and I suppose open warfare, cannibalism, and child sacrifice wouldn&rsquo;t be much further in the future. It is only being held back by those few remaining White racists trying to hang on so they can live in a African-created paradise. (sarcasm)</p>

As a Classicist I find the comparison sick and twisted. As well as intellectually dishonest and a skewing of the truth to compare what is happening in Liberia as anything similar to Romans.</p>
<p>The Romans would use execution as a means of sending a message or making a demonstration. Every civilized society has rules, laws, and order that are ENFORCED. In Roman society they knew the importance of adhering to the rule of the law, they were a militant society you know. A general who failed deserved to off himself, just like military units that turned coward would have to execute every tenth man of his own, because they were the shield of the state and people if they failed thousands could die. Enemies of the State were nailed to a piece of wood or torn apart in the arena to show a point that criminals deserved ignominious and priests and priestess that didn&rsquo;t honor their vows were not trustworthy you do know that temples and their priests were the banks and security deposits of their day, if their keepers were untrustworthy then very important people risked losing a lot of the wrath of the state.</p>
<p>The Romans founded an Empire that ran on the rule of law, something fundamental to the modern West, and law without punishment is powerless, a joke like what we have today.</p>

A comparison is an illustration by similitude, not a series of historical points used to justify a conclusory statement. Our movement, which is already under intense scrutiny, must strive for truth, so as not to give any more ammunition to our detractors. I agree that contemporary western society is relatively lawless and without honor, specifically when compared to the greatness of ancient Rome, but I shall not stand by and have my honor sullied, no matter the medium, virtual or otherwise, and have my words distorted by some neophyte of an amateur historian masquerading as a &#8220;classicist.&#8221; I found the demeanor of your whole post distasteful and ultimately counterproductive. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe that the preeminence of the literalist interpretation of the rule of law in western society, is partially to blame for the current perilous state that our people find themselves in. Enemies of our race, from within and without, misrepresent and pervert our laws through subtle manipulations of language, applying laws meant specifically for white peoples to all peoples by virtue of lecherous chicanery. If our people weren&rsquo;t such suckers for &#8220;rule of law,&#8221; then we wouldn&rsquo;t be in the precarious situation that we are now. My main problem with a dogmatic adherence to the rule of law, specifically of the contemporary variety, is that modern people, particularly in America, mistake &#8220;law&#8221; for actual &#8220;justice.&#8221; And this is the hallmark of a failing state. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wish to delve into an antagonistic clash of ad hominem attacks, particularly with a fellow comrade in our struggle, but you are obviously not a &#8220;classicist&#8221; as you say. Your syntax and inflections are written like that of an amateur historian, a dilettante, and not that of a classically educated scholar. The Romans were a bellicose people, ruled by laws, as you say, nevertheless this still doesn&rsquo;t negate the fact that they did in fact practice ritualistic human sacrifice. </p>
<p>Firstly, the &#8220;devotio&#8221; wasn&rsquo;t initiated by Roman generals who failed, it wasn&rsquo;t an egotistical suicide of the type we see today, it was a ritualistic prophylactic used to ensure victory. You are mistakenly referring to, I am assuming, the oath of the &#8220;Sacramentum Militare&#8221; taken by Roman military officers. Being a &#8220;classicist&#8221; as you say you are, you should possess a firm grasp of both Latin and Greek, and thus realize that all citizens, could be &#8220;given to the gods&#8221; (sacer). And that this type of sacrifice, either of a voluntary or involuntary nature, was considered a sacred honor that all loyal citizens would have gladly undertaken; the term itself refers to &#8220;unspoiled purity&#8221; and &#8220;perfection.&#8221; As you should know, the Romans were a hyper religious people, particularly during the glorious pagan years, and that sacrifice, of any type, voluntary, involuntary or otherwise was perceived as being a gift to the gods; the &#8220;act&#8221; of the sacrifice itself at least. In fact, those who were sacrificed, properly that is, were quite literally considered to be the divine property of the gods, and thus honored, both criminals and generals alike. Their corporal remains however, as I alluded to previously, was an altogether different matter. </p>
<p>Secondly, I am assuming your statement about soldiers being ritualistically murdered for cowardice, is in reference to the practice of the &#8220;decimation.&#8221; Being &#8220;decimated,&#8221; which in Latin means the &#8220;removal of a tenth&#8221; wasn&rsquo;t religious in nature, nor was it a sacrifice of any type, is was a disciplinary measure utilized to ensure loyalty. Moreover, this disciplinary measure was rarely practiced, and fell out of disuse, writ large, by the time of the Principate of Augustus (i.e. by the beginning of the Imperial period). Sure, it still happened on occasion during the Imperial period, but its ineffectiveness as a disciplinary measure rendered it generally useless. Why was the act of decimation useless? Because it executed indiscriminately, regardless of fault, and thus ended up killing many a good soldier. </p>
<p>Thirdly, my above post referenced the priestesses of Vesta (i.e. the Vestal Virgins) and they were not a &#8220;bank&#8221; of any sort. The handling of money was considered profane (a reason for the prominence of the Jew within the later Empire, who did handle money), and the six women who constituted the Vestal priestesshood, at its zenith, weren&rsquo;t allowed to possess any type of currency; nor were they allowed to leave the city of Rome for that matter. The Vestals did maintain the sacred fire of Vesta, house religious artifacts (some priceless, some not so priceless) and guard the last will and testaments of important citizens (like Caesar and Pompey), but they were not a bank in the modern sense of term.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-231039" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The Romans did in fact practice human sacrifice, at least during the regal (monarchical) and early republican periods, respectively. Human sacrifice wasn&rsquo;t outlawed officially in Roman lands until 97 BC, by the Consul P. Licinius Crassus, via senatorial decree. </p>
<p>There are three examples of Roman human sacrifice that we know about, thanks to the writings of both Livy and Plutarch. These three instances of human sacrifice took place in the years 228, 216 and 113<br/>
BC. The actual act of sacrifice was later replaced by the rituals of the Argei. During the Argei rituals, puppets and other effigies were sacrificed in lieu of human beings; thus the actual act of sacrifice moved from the literal to the symbolic. Many criminals in the early Republic were also considered &#8220;sacer,&#8221; which &#8220;meant for the gods&#8221; and sacrificed, occasionally even for minor offences. Also, lets not forget that there are numerous instances of Vestal Virgins being scarified for amongst other things, violating their chastity. For example, the Vestal Oppia was buried alive in 483 BC because she broke her oath of celibacy. It&rsquo;s also important to note that victims of involuntary human sacrifice couldn&rsquo;t be cremated, they had to be buried, which was perceived as being dishonorable. Also, of related note, was the Roman military practice of the &#8220;devotio&#8221; in which Roman generals, and other upper echelon officers, would sacrifice themselves to gods (specifically Manes) for victory. A concrete example of this is the case of the General Publius Decius Mus, who in 340 BC, sacrificed himself for victory. </p>
<p>Secondly, I wanted to point out that the Romans adopted the idea of gladiatorial contest from the Etruscans, as another user pointed out. However, the Etruscan and early Roman gladiatorial feats of combat were voluntary in nature and considered honorable, and rarely resulted in death. And lastly, it was actually the Sabellian people of central and southern Italy who developed gladiatorial combat; the Etruscans merely adopted this practice.</p>

As I stated in the post below, &#8220;A comparison is an illustration by similitude, not a series of historical points used to justify a conclusory statement.&#8221; Several users erroneously stated the following (paraphrased): THE ROMANS NEVER COMMITTED HUMAN SACRIFICE, WHEN IN FACT THEY DID. I merely tried to correct to this fallacious statement. As I said in my post below, our belief system and its corresponding sociopolitical perspective makes our movement &#8220;easy pickings&#8221; for our detractors, thus I find it prudent (as I hope others would as well) to dispel fallacy, so we may not be labeled as delusional by our adversaries. </p>
<p>To reiterate, there was no comparison of any sort made between ancient Rome and contemporary Liberia, within any aspect of my post. Despite your crass attitude, and obviously disingenuous &#8220;thank you,&#8221; you are still nonetheless &#8220;welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am a bit taken aghast with the seemingly cursory and overly simplistic responses to my lengthy, and well thought out discussion postings here on AmRen. Did you even bother to read my entire post, or did you merely glance at it before you began espousing fallacious a priori statements? I am a new user here and to put it quite bluntly I am not impressed with the conversational dialogue that I&rsquo;ve experienced thus far.

Doing the right think is it&rsquo;s own reward. This Christian morality has enabled free societies to thrive. Blacks can not comprehend the idea that doing right is it&rsquo;s own reward.

<p>Why? There&rsquo;s no doubt that Christianity has played a central role in European culture for over a thousand years. Christianity has been both good and bad, it&rsquo;s as flawed as it&rsquo;s human followers and as great as it&rsquo;s human followers. I share your dislike of people who give Christianity no historical context and judge it by 21st century secular standards but I also see that Christianity, and all other God based religions, is a relic of a past that was unscientific and superstitious. To hold onto religion for some misplaced cultural pride when we now live in a more enlightened time would be foolish. It&rsquo;s best to accept that religion was something we needed in the absence of knowledge and move on and embrace scientific discovery, which is just as European as Christianity.</p>

Indeed, any honest person could look at the evidence and decide we live in a universe that, although arguably &#8216;flawed&rsquo; in some regards, still exhibits functions of purposeful design (not just those made by human hands). If you mean the specific Deity of Christianity, then I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily disagree with your statement. Organized religion does have lower rates of attendance in first-world nations.</p>
<p>But the end result of believing in a truly naturalistic/inherently purposeless universe is, of course, nihilism, which isn&rsquo;t really conducive to &#8216;societal advancement&rsquo; at all, just destruction. Why &#8216;advance&rsquo; if we&rsquo;re mere human fertilizer?

When in actual fact, the Bible and religious doctrine is based on innate human morality and the cultural values of the society that interprets them at any given time. Agnostics and Atheists are not violent criminals, they don&rsquo;t abandon their wives and children and live their lives in a libertine pursuit of debauchery and gratification because they are free of religious constraints. No, they live their lives as other normal humans do because on the whole, humans are innately humane.</p>
<p> Religion is a man made construct, which I respect in an historical sense but that now lacks the insight to tell us anything new about the world. We now have science as a much superior mode of thought. It&rsquo;s evolutionary.</p>

<p>There is the classic argument of humanism vs Christianity. Humanists believe people are inherently good. Christianity teaches that people are inherently bad.</p>
<p>I believe that not only history proves Christianity correct, but also our daily lives.</p>
<p>As far as &#8220;not living a life of debauchery,&#8221; what does that mean? Who defines &#8220;debauchery&#8221;? Homosexuality used to be considered the worst of &#8220;debauchery,&#8221; now it is becoming so-called mainstream. So which is it? That&rsquo;s the problem with humanism - it is unstable and illogical. </p>
<p>Also, I did not say that Atheists live lives of debauchery. I stated that they might as well. Why not? They have no one to answer for it if they can get away with it. They can murder, steal, lie, cheat, commit adultery, incest. What difference should it make to them. They are their own god. Anything less than doing what satisfies what ever desire they have at the moment is just a ruse. </p>
<p>Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I believe God desires for us to be happy, but He made the world and us and has put rules in place for our own good. Deviate from those rules at your own risk. God genuinely wants the best for you. Your genes only want you to procreate. Your brain desires pleasure. The combination does not always end up so well for most people. </p>
<p>Also, since God made the Universe and us, he&rsquo;s in charge like a CEO of a company. You may not like his rules or his methods or what he says you must do for forgiveness (Jesus Christ), but none of what we think or like changes how things are. Accept it and live. Reject it and die.</p>

<p>Of course, there are bad people but on the whole, people are moral, so I have to disagree with you.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is a part of the human condition and has been there before Christianity or humanism. It&rsquo;s a behaviour that is observed in other higher primates like Gorillas and Chimps, so was almost certainly there in our earlier human forms. Why can&rsquo;t we say that it&rsquo;s Christianity that is illogical for condemning Homosexuality when it&rsquo;s an inherent part of humanity.</p>
<p><i>Also, I did not say that Atheists live lives of debauchery. I stated<br/>

<p>Typical religious thought. They don&rsquo;t behave like that because it&rsquo;s not in their nature to behave like that. Fear of hell is not what keeps Humans on the straight and narrow, just as fear of prison doesn&rsquo;t keep most people from being a murderer. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t like God or Jesus&rsquo; rules. There is plenty to like about Jesus. I just don&rsquo;t believe he was a God, nor do I believe in a higher power. It&rsquo;s clear from the historical evolution of religion that it is man made and not Holy.</p>
<p><i> Accept it and live. Reject it and die.</i></p>
<p>Fear mongering doesn&rsquo;t really work on people who know the truth about religion. It is empty.</p>

How do you know with certainty what happens after you die? You are certain you have no soul? How can you possibly be sure? </p>
<p>The real question: &#8220;Is there life after death?&#8221; That&rsquo;s why in two cases that I know of Josh McDowell (&#8220;Evidence than Demands a Verdict&#8221;) and Lew Wallace (&#8220;Ben Hur&#8221;) both understood that if they could disprove Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, Christianity would be meaningless. They were correct. Both left to do their research atheists, both returned Christians. </p>
<p>Perhaps you should look into the facts of Christ&rsquo;s life. If He was who He said He was, it would be wise to follow Him. It&rsquo;s not scare tactics. It&rsquo;s a fuller life. </p>
<p>I would also recommend the writing of another former ardent atheist, C.S. Lewis. His book &#8220;Mere Christianity&#8221; is a thoughtful look at God.</p>

<p>Of course, I cannot be sure about the beginnings of the universe or what happens to humans after death but I am sure that Jesus was not the son of God, that the God of the bible is a myth and that there is no such thing as heaven and hell. Religious scholars know that the whole history of the Abrahamic religions was a progression of ideas where older gods and religious stories would evolve into newer ones, gods would be amalgamated into one god etc. until eventually we were left with the God. This would not happen if there really were a true deity. The history of Christianity is a mish mash of ideas and images blended together, it&rsquo;s not sacred, it&rsquo;s not holy, it&rsquo;s human.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why, as I see it, to oppose Christianity while professing to be a champion of what the rest of the world calls the &#8220;Christian&#8221; nations makes little sense. </p>
<p>The fundamental transformation of the U.S. is more than just racial/demographic. We can&rsquo;t lop off something as central to our culture as its religion without participating in that fundamental transformation ourselves.</p>

In that respect, &#8220;post-Christian&#8221; is no different from &#8220;post-racial&#8221; (which is actually open hostility to white people), and &#8220;post-Western&#8221; (or multicultural, which actually means open hostility to the traditional culture in favor of the alien). The U.S. doesn&rsquo;t need fundamental transformation; it needs to return to the cultural forces that made it great.</p>

Guilt just does&rsquo;nt register with them. This modern idea of raising them to their full potential ( either by eugenics or economic means) is delusional. This idea is more immoral than colonialism in my view. You cant alter their basic nature, the best of them will learn to mimic and parrot values that are alien to them. They cant be what they&rsquo;re not meant to be. Leave them to their own devices. It&rsquo;s best to recognise we belong to different breeds when dealing with these people.</p>

With semi-restrictive policies (no breeding for those who are moderately or severely retarded, and later those who are retarded at all, and tax incentives for more intelligent people to breed), we could bring the African IQ up to white standards within a century or two easily. Usually I think of black crime and unemployment as a result of their low IQ (when you adjust for IQ, blacks make as much money as whites, although that doesn&rsquo;t account for affirmative action and says nothing about crime). But if it is the result of high testosterone or something *not* linked intelligence, jerking the average African IQ up 30 points will be a disaster for the world rather than an improvement.</p>

Intelligence requires personal responsibility. In any functional society one must possess an ingrained sense of right or wrong. We white Americans simply refer to it as morals or values, doing the right thing. At least, those are the character traits of most white Americans, especially those over 30 or so. We all certainly remember instances of parental instruction and correction which instilled these values. Simple things like doing our chores before we played, or eating our dinner without complaint. Our father went to work every morning and brought the pay home every Friday for groceries, clothes, school things, our home. Our homes were clean and our mothers wholesome and kind. I think we don&rsquo;t even realize how truly valuable being raised a white, middle-class American is in terms of deep character and worth! And I don&rsquo;t think we realize the truly desperate lives these ignorant blacks live. Intelligence would most likely be wasted on them. They don&rsquo;t have the stable upbringing, core values, solid personal, psychological and lifestyle behaviors that would respond well to introducing intelligence to their gene pool.<br/>

When white Christians, the Serbs, were attempting to protect the territorial integrity of their country, as well as defend themselves against the muslims, it was called brutalities, when in fact it was self-defense. And as far as I know the Serbs weren&rsquo;t hacking off arms and legs and eating the Muslims.</p>
<p>On a bright (from your point of view) note, the Muslims have almost completely ethnically cleansed Kosovo of its native population.</p>

I was not attacking the Serbs or any other other white national group, merely citing one example, among many, of European brutalities that included the wartime Croatian attacks on Serbs, Tito&rsquo;s crimes against various groups during and after WW2, and civil-war crimes on all sides during the break-up of Yugoslavia. My viewpoint is NOT at all sympathetic to the prolonged Muslim takeover of Kosovo with its historic lands, churches and people of Serbian origin; indeed, I see it as a warning to all Europe.<br/>
Of course, Serbian and all European civilization is more advanced than black Africa. Nevertheless, western technology can produce horrors equal to the cannibalism of primitives; for example, bombing campaigns.<br/>
We need white unity and the use of our science for the good of our peoples.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-237867" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The recent Washington Post article regarding gun deaths in America appeared in AR as well. It showed 151 blacks per million per year are victims of gun murder, almost all of whom are murdered by other blacks. In contrast, only 15 per million whites die by guns annually, and a fair percentage of whites are killed by blacks or Hispanics. The rate is TEN TIMES (1,000%) higher for blacks as compared to whites. The racial disparity is huge and rarely highlighted in the MSM. Liberia is raw violence and pure sexual licentiousness, far beyond the worst slums in American cities, reflecting unimaginable degeneracy beyond even the slums of South Africa. It is a Lord of the Flies nation completely lacking in civilizational restraint. Perhaps within some of the churches and a few upper income neighborhoods, civility prevails. I am canceling my vacation to Monrovia and going to Maui instead.</p>

This was the same year Jefferson took office in DC and did nothing about the slave situation in America knowing full well what savage cannibals they were if they had the bigger numbers that Obama is trying to give them with the mexicans and miscegenation.<br/>
The South made the major mistake in 1821 when the Virginia Company organized the formation of Liberia not to organize and return all their African slaves back and revamp their entire inferior economic system to sharecropping and paid wages to white labor since the system of slavery was outrageous in costs and upkeep. Another missed opportunity of the many others but plantations were businesses and owners were more concerned with profit and losses not changing an entire social structure. That was unfortunate considering Liberia would have been the final chance to correct the flawed system and start anew with white labor who were starving and living worse than slaves.</p>
