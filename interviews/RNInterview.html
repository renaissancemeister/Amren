                  <p>I started <i>AR </i>in 1990 
                    for what many would consider radical or even dangerous purposes: 
                    to encourage whites to think of their interests in explicitly 
                    racial terms, to recognize that every other race in the United 
                    States does so instinctively, and to understand that if whites 
                    alone fail to act as a group, they jeopardize their long-term 
                    survival as a distinct people with a distinct culture and 
                    way of life.</font></p>

                  </font> 
                  <p>Needless to say, this is not 
                    a message welcomed by the establishment. However, ordinary 
                    Americans increasingly understand the crisis our country faces. 
                    <i>AR </i>has now been publishing monthly for nearly 14 years, 
                    and our readership continues to grow. Five years ago, we began 
                    distributing an electronic version of <i>AR </i>over the Internet, 
                    and this has greatly increased our overseas readership.</font></p>

                  <p>My association with the magazine 
                    has resulted in a certain notoriety and many radio and television 
                    appearances. I believe that the logical and moral force of 
                    the <i>AR </i>position is increasingly winning recognition 
                    despite ingrained and intense hostility to any form of racial 
                    consciousness on the part of whites.</font></p>

                  <p>I would like to think that the 
                    <i>AR </i>credo is realism and fairness: realism in the sense 
                    that race is a central element in individual and group identity 
                    and must not be ignored; fairness in that there must be no 
                    double standards in racial or ethnic matters.</font></p>

                  </font> 
                  <p>A number of policy conclusions 
                    derive from these positions. A realistic evaluation of race 
                    leads to the conclusion that race and culture are inseparable. 
                    Some individuals can fully embrace a culture established by 
                    people of a different race but most cannot. This is why race 
                    is the most volatile social fault line in any country and 
                    why the current dramas of &lsquo;tolerance&rsquo;, &lsquo;multiculturalism&rsquo;, 
                    &lsquo;inclusion&rsquo;, etc, are almost always about race.</font></p>

                  </font> 
                  <p>The United States is a good 
                    example of the significance of race. Whites from many countries 
                    have largely assimilated&mdash;with some friction&mdash;to a 
                    majority Anglo-Saxon culture, but non-whites have not. Europe 
                    is now going through the same process, with one country after 
                    another discovering that when non-whites arrive in large numbers 
                    they congregate in unassimilable enclaves.</font></p>
                  <p> 
                   
                  <p> </p>
                  </font> 
                  <p>This raises the question of 
                    fairness. Whites are repeatedly told that they must make every 
                    effort to accommodate alien newcomers and even, if need be, 
                    see their nations redefined if non-white immigration requires 
                    this. Whites are told to prepare themselves psychologically 
                    to be outnumbered by non-whites, and even though this threatens 
                    to wash away the cultures and nationalities we love, anyone 
                    who resists dispossession is a moral inferior.</font></p>

                  </font> 
                  <p>Just imagine the reverse process 
                    of whites pouring into Mexico or Pakistan, forcing their practices 
                    upon the natives and even demanding special treatment because 
                    they are minorities bearing the gift of &lsquo;diversity&rsquo;. 
                    Imagine Mexican and Pakistani leaders telling their people 
                    demographic displacement is a good thing, and that new languages, 
                    religions, folkways and crime rates may seem alien but are 
                    precious sources of enrichment.</font></p>

                  <p>It is this one-sided advancement 
                    of non-whites into white territories that makes the current 
                    dynamic of race and immigration unacceptable and even dangerous

                    came to the conclusion that the basic tenets of liberalism&mdash;that

                    more important than genetics, that all groups have the same

                  <p>Yes. The <i>Blank Slate </i>by 
                    Steven Pinker is a good example of this [Editor&rsquo;s Note: 
                    See review, <i>RN </i>41]. The evidence for the influence 
                    of genes is now so overwhelming even liberals can no longer 
                    ignore it. This book, however, is an almost comical attempt 
                    by a liberal to try to reconcile the power of heredity with 
                    liberal positions that are fatally undermined by it. I suspect 
                    that the Watson-Skinner conviction that environment controls 
                    everything first foundered on sex differences. Many people 
                    understand that the failure of liberals and feminists to erase 
                    sex differences must mean there is a biological basis for 
                    them. It is more difficult for people to accept similar reasons 
                    for the clearly different social outcomes for racial and other 
                    groups, but that will come.</font></p>

                  <p>I have always recommended only 
                    two policies: an end to mass immigration, and the abolition 
                    of antidiscrimination laws. The population of the United States 
                    is increasing like that of a Third World country, mostly because 
                    of immigration. 90% of immigrants are unassimilable minorities 
                    who will bring divisiveness and tension. Population increase 
                    will also strain environment and infrastructure. There were 
                    125m Americans in 1945, and no one thought the country under-populated. 
                    There are now about 290m of us, with about half a billion 
                    expected by 2070 or so. Ending immigration would stop this 
                    mad expansion. As for anti-discrimination laws, private citizens 
                    should have the right to choose employees, schoolmates, or 
                    neighbours for good reasons, bad reasons or no reason at all&mdash;just 
                    as they choose their spouses.</font></p>

                  <p>There is increasing interest 
                    in &lsquo;immigration reform&rsquo; within Republican circles. 
                    What do you think of these various initiatives? And what do

                    &lsquo;immigration reform&rsquo; amounts to nothing more than 
                    common-sense resistance to President Bush&rsquo;s amnesty plan 
                    for illegal immigrants. Ralph Nader seems to oppose immigration 
                    mainly because it depresses wages for poor blacks. Indeed 
                    it does, and I support all restrictionists, whatever their

                    conservatives&mdash;not just towards <i>AR </i>specifically, 
                    but also on race differences more generally?</font></p>

                  <p>I don&rsquo;t think it is possible 
                    to give a comprehensive answer. Even among &lsquo;conservatives&rsquo; 
                    (a term sadly in search of a meaning), there is much resistance 
                    to a realistic understanding of race. If they were sure their 
                    words would never be repeated, I suspect perhaps 50% of the 
                    people who vote Republican would either acknowledge racial 
                    differences or, though bothered by the thought, accept them 
                    as a possibility. Of this number, only a handful are willing 
                    to take a public position on race that differs substantially 
                    from that of Democrats.</font></p>

                  <p><b>Has there been a discernible 
                    change in US conservative attitudes on race in recent decades? 
                    What has caused this?</b></font></p>

                  <p>&#147;Recent decades&#148; is 
                    a stretchy formulation. If it includes the 1950s, <i>National 
                    Review </i>wrote very sensibly on race. Its positions were 
                    little different from those of <i>American Renaissance </i>today. 
                    During the 1960s, &lsquo;70s, and &lsquo;80s there was a massive 
                    retreat from commonsense. Since that time there has been a 
                    very slow recovery, but at nothing like the pace of the rout. 
                    Egalitarian dogma rules America, just as it does Britain, 
                    and dissent is still dangerous and disagreeable.</font></p>

                  <p><b>Does modern genetic science 
                    complement traditional conservative or religious thinking 
                    about human nature? If so, how?</b></font></p>

                  <p>I think it complements traditional 
                    conservatism almost across the board. Both traditional conservatives 
                    and (the more outspoken) evolutionary biologists agree on 
                    the following: Men and women differ in temperament and ability. 
                    People are born with distinctive traits not easily changed 
                    by society. Race and race differences are real. People are 
                    tribal, and do not easily feel loyalty to humanity at large.</font></p>

                  <p> </p>
                  </font> 
                  <p>Even more fundamentally, both 
                    sides agree that there is such a thing as human nature and 
                    it is folly to try to remake man. An acceptance of this premise 
                    would have forestalled not just the calamity of communism 
                    but virtually every liberal project since the French Revolution. 
                    Horror upon horror has been committed in the name of perfecting 
                    man. Conservatives&mdash;and now students of the power of genetics&mdash;accept 
                    that many of our faults cannot be corrected, and that societies 
                    that accept these faults are far more successful than those 
                    that try to wish them away or forcibly extirpate them.</font></p>

                  </font> 
                  <p>Selfishness is a good example. 
                    Capitalism recognizes that self-interest is the most powerful 
                    engine of economic progress. Collectivism fails because it 
                    pretends self-interest can be overcome. Some day there will 
                    be equal acceptance of man&rsquo;s tribal nature, and governments 
                    will stop thinking it somehow a virtue to force citizens to 
                    live with people utterly unlike themselves.</font></p>

                  <p>I have two great interests: 
                    my family and music. Fatherhood has been more rewarding to 
                    me than anything else&mdash;and I expected it to be a bother 
                    and a pest. European populations are declining, in part because 
                    Europeans are self-centred and think children are too much 
                    trouble. If only for our own survival, we must once again 
                    promote the view that children are one of life&rsquo;s highest 
                    rewards. I might not have believed that until I had children 
                    of my own, but it is true. As for music, I play clarinet in 
                    a symphony orchestra and a woodwind quintet, and saxophone 
                    in a dance band. Making music is, for me, a joy that purges 
                    the mind of all else. Musicians reportedly live longer than 
                    non-musicians. If that is true, it must be because immense 
                    mental pleasure has physical benefits!</font></p>
