                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: Tomorrow, President 
                    Bush announces his plan for limited amnesty for illegal immigrants. 
                    But will it be limited enough? That heated debate coming up. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">And another royal shakeup. 
                    Before she died, Princess Diana wrote that she thought someone 
                    was planning to kill her. It turns out that someone was Prince 
                    Charles. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="3">And 14 years after he was 
                    banned from baseball, Pete Rose decides it&rsquo;s time to 
                    step up to the plate and admit that he did bet on the national 
                    pastime. But should that earn him a spot in the Hall of Fames? 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Well, tomorrow, the president 
                    of the United States is going to officially surrender to illegal 
                    immigrants. It&rsquo;s time for tonight&rsquo;s &#147;Real Deal.&#148; 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">President Bush is about to 
                    rewrite the rules on illegal immigration by essentially ignoring 
                    those rules. Reports out of Washington tonight are that the 
                    White House is going to announce a new policy that would allow 
                    American jobs to be assigned to illegal immigrants. The Bush 
                    plan allows American employers to hire Mexican citizens to 
                    fill American jobs. Now, these jobs are supposedly too demeaning 
                    for Americans to occupy, but that concept is utter nonsense. 
                    The only reason Americans aren&rsquo;t taking these jobs in 
                    question is because businesses are able to fill their employment 
                    rolls with illegal immigrants. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">These illegal immigrants will 
                    work for next to nothing. So, if the United States government 
                    actually protected our bordered and enforced the employment 
                    laws that you pay for them to enforce, these jobs in question 
                    would pay good enough wages for Americans to fill. But, then 
                    again, living by the law of the land might actually affect 
                    some businesses&rsquo; bottom line. Besides, as we all know, 
                    playing to illegal aliens is all the rage in Washington these 
                    days, where politicians of both parties cynically believe 
                    that the only way to win votes is by embracing a group of 
                    criminals who come to our country, break our laws, and take 
                    our jobs. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Tomorrow, the chief law enforcement 
                    officer of the United States is going to tell the world that 
                    America has given up its battle to protect its borders. And 
                    what that means for our nation&rsquo;s security is anybody&rsquo;s 
                    guess. It&rsquo;s a disturbing turn of events in Washington. 
                    And it&rsquo;s tonight&rsquo;s &#147;Real Deal.&#148; </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Now, the president is giving 
                    a big speech tomorrow on his immigration policy. And his press 
                    secretary, Scott McClellan, gave us a preview of what to expect. 
                    </font></p>

                  <p><font size="3">SCOTT MCCLELLAN, WHITE HOUSE 
                    PRESS SECRETARY: If employers are offering jobs to Americans 
                    that Americans are not willing to fill, then we ought to welcome 
                    to our country those who will fill that job. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: And with us tonight 
                    is Jared Taylor. He&rsquo;s the publisher of &#147;The American 
                    Renaissance.&#148; And we also have Dan Griswold. Dan is an 
                    immigration expert from the Cato Institute. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Jared Taylor, you heard the 
                    president&rsquo;s spokesman. What should we make of George 
                    Bush&rsquo;s plan to offer American jobs to illegal immigrants? 
                    </font></p>

                    RENAISSANCE&#148;: Well, I think you said it extremely well. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">They&rsquo;re going to try 
                    to dress this thing up and pretend that it&rsquo;s not an amnesty, 
                    but that&rsquo;s clearly what it is. Anything short of deportation 
                    for illegals is an amnesty. We had one once before in 1986. 
                    It was supposed to be the never-again, one-time-only amnesty. 
                    And to be talking about it again I think is extremely irresponsible 
                    and makes the country look untrustworthy. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: Dan Griswold, 
                    the president&rsquo;s statement tomorrow may be perceived by 
                    some as the White House&rsquo;s attempt to cynically win over 
                    Hispanic voters. Isn&rsquo;t that what&rsquo;s going on here? 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">DAN GRISWOLD, CATO INSTITUTE: 
                    No, Joe, I think you have got it wrong and I think the president 
                    has it right. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">He&rsquo;s trying to get U.S.&mdash;our 
                    dysfunctional immigration laws in conformity with the reality 
                    of American life. Look, the U.S. economy is going to continue 
                    to create millions of low-skill jobs at a time when U.S. workers 
                    are increasingly unwilling to take those jobs. We&rsquo;re 
                    getting older. We&rsquo;re getting better educated. Where was 
                    the line of people, Americans, waiting to stay up all night 
                    waiting to scrub toilets at Wal-Mart? It&rsquo;s just not there. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">(CROSSTALK) </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">GRISWOLD: And, at the same 
                    time, there&rsquo;s no . . . </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: But, Dan, you&rsquo;re 
                    saying we have dysfunctional immigration laws. But what&rsquo;s 
                    dysfunctional, the laws themselves or our refusal to enforce 
                    those laws? </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">GRISWOLD: The laws are unenforceable, 
                    because we have this gap, this gap between the jobs we&rsquo;re 
                    creating and the unwillingness of Americans to take these 
                    jobs. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">These workers come here because 
                    there is demand for their services. They&rsquo;re serving important 
                    functions in industries like construction, agriculture, hotel 
                    and motel industry, light manufacturing. We have manufacturing 
                    industries that would go offshore. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">(CROSSTALK) </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: Jared Taylor, 
                    what do you say to that? Are there certain jobs in America 
                    that are just too demeaning and too low-paying for Americans 
                    to fill? </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">TAYLOR: I think you put it 
                    very well, Joe, when you opened this segment here. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">We now have an estimated nine 
                    to 12 million immigrants. We have nine million unemployed 
                    Americans. You hit it on the head when you said, if those 
                    illegal immigrants were not here, we might pay a little bit 
                    more for those jobs. What it means, Americans would have those 
                    jobs and not these lawbreakers and queue-jumpers, who have 
                    pushed in here, breaking our laws as it is. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: Now, here&rsquo;s 
                    what President Bush is reportedly going to propose as a guest 
                    worker program tomorrow, that U.S. companies will post jobs 
                    on the Internet that they can&rsquo;t fill here. Immigrants 
                    will then apply, have a background check. And if they pass, 
                    they stay for three years and can renew for three more. Eventually, 
                    they could even apply for a green card.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Now, Jared Taylor, what do 
                    you say about this plan that, again&mdash;let&rsquo;s not brush 
                    over the fact that these people are breaking our laws and 
                    now they&rsquo;re actually going to be allowed through this 
                    process to get a green card.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">TAYLOR: First of all, first 
                    of all, there was never a guest worker program that ended 
                    up&mdash;that didn&rsquo;t end up being a squatter worker program. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Guests are here at our pleasure 
                    and go home when we say go home. Ask the Germans about their 
                    guest workers, the Turks, who are now an assimilable minority 
                    that cause terrible problems. The idea of a guest worker problem 
                    will work only if there&rsquo;s some sort of immaculate insertion 
                    of these people into the economy and they have no interaction 
                    with the rest of the country and then they disappear. That&rsquo;s 
                    impossible. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">These people will have children. 
                    They will have wives. They will have girlfriends. They will 
                    be on the public dole. They will be getting hurt and going 
                    to emergency rooms. The idea that this will not affect the 
                    rest of the country is, I think, eyewash. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: Dan Griswold, 
                    isn&rsquo;t the president going to be admitting tomorrow that 
                    America is incapable of protecting its borders? </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">GRISWOLD: Not at all. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">In fact, I think this is going 
                    to help us protect our borders. Secretary Ridge, the homeland 
                    security secretary, two or three weeks ago started this conversation 
                    by saying it would make his job easier if we knew who was 
                    here. We have eight million people living in a kind of legal 
                    twilight zone. If they have a path a legalization, they&rsquo;ll 
                    be more inclined to cooperate with law enforcement. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">We can begin to drain the 
                    swamp of smuggling and document fraud. We can free up resources 
                    to go after terrorists. Why is our Homeland Security Department 
                    expending its resources trying to bust janitors at Wal-Mart? 
                    I&rsquo;d rather have them going after terrorists. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">I think that&rsquo;s why Secretary 
                    Ridge and President Bush, who&rsquo;s doing everything he can, 
                    I think, to protect us from terrorism, I think this is the 
                    right thing to do. It&rsquo;s good for our national security, 
                    good for our economy. It&rsquo;s humane and just approach to 
                    immigration. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: Now, Jared, this 
                    is the same argument that we heard when California was talking 
                    about giving illegal aliens drivers licenses. They said that 
                    law enforcement officers actually said, hey, it will make 
                    our job easier. We&rsquo;ll know who is in the country illegally 
                    and we&rsquo;ll be able to track them down. Do you buy that 
                    argument?</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">TAYLOR: We&rsquo;re just making 
                    it easier and more attractive for people who should stay home 
                    to come here. It will have no effect, other than encourage 
                    yet others to come and break the law to come in. </font></p>

                    too, will get an amnesty. We are opening up a door that will 
                    result in a flood. Already, look, we have one-fifth of the 
                    population of Mexico living here. How much of Mexico do we 
                    wish to have, especially given that Mexicans are three times 
                    as likely as whites to commit violent crimes? There&rsquo;s 
                    not a single school district in the country where Mexicans 
                    perform at the level of whites and Asians.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">There&rsquo;s not a single 
                    majority Mexican neighborhood that Mr. Griswold would probably 
                    want to live in. Why do would we want to increase the proportion 
                    of Mexicans already here? </font></p>

                    to that. There were several charges made by Jared. Respond 
                    to those, please. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">GRISWOLD: Again, President 
                    Bush grew up in Texas. He was governor of that great state.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">He knows. There is a state 
                    where U.S. and Mexican-Americans live side by side, work side 
                    by side in a peaceful, productive culture. The president has 
                    said family values don&rsquo;t stop at the Rio Grande. Immigrants 
                    are hardworking, peaceful people. We should welcome them if 
                    they&rsquo;re coming here to fill jobs that Americans don&rsquo;t 
                    want. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">TAYLOR: I would like Mr. Bush 
                    to tell me to name one majority Mexican neighborhood he would 
                    like to live in, one majority Mexican school he&rsquo;d like 
                    his children to attend. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">It&rsquo;s all very well . 
                    . . </font></p>

                    out and see this country.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">TAYLOR: Hey, then you name 
                    one yourself. Name one Mexican neighborhood you&rsquo;d like 
                    to live in. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">This is typical. These are 
                    people who say, OK, this is great. I don&rsquo;t care if these 
                    Mexicans are going to live 20 or 30 in a house, because it&rsquo;s 
                    not my daughter who&rsquo;s going to look across the back fence 
                    and see them urinating in their yard. No, I&rsquo;m happy to 
                    get a guy who can mow the lawn for $2 an hour and that&rsquo;s 
                    all I care about. This is a much bigger question. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="3">GRISWOLD: Joe, this is not 
                    worthy of your show. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">(CROSSTALK) </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: I was just going 
                    to say, obviously, there&rsquo;s some </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">stereotypes out there that 
                    I may not agree with, that you may not agree </font></p>

                  <p><font size="3">TAYLOR: This is reality, Joe. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: But the bottom 
                    line is this, Dan.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">(CROSSTALK) </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: Yes, you can 
                    talk about that, but I want you to also respond to this. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Just talking about illegal 
                    immigration for a minute. And I know Cato is a libertarian 
                    organization, the less laws, the better. But are there any 
                    immigration laws that you and Cato would believe we need to 
                    enforce? </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">GRISWOLD: Absolutely. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">What we have now is anarchy, 
                    Joe. I want a system that is safe, orderly and legal. We need 
                    to have laws that are first in conformity with the realities 
                    of our life. We&rsquo;re incorporating this US-VISIT program, 
                    which I think is a reasonable response to have&mdash;keep track 
                    of who enters the country and who leaves. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">But we can&rsquo;t have our 
                    laws in fundamental conflict with the reality of the needs 
                    of the American economy and American life. And that&rsquo;s 
                    what we have now. And I think the president is trying to bring 
                    our immigration laws into conformity with how we&rsquo;re actually 
                    living your lives. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Now, I just want to say about 
                    Mexicans, they have a high rate of two-parent families, a 
                    high rate of homeownership. They&rsquo;re religious people. 
                    They&rsquo;re family-oriented people. I just think it&rsquo;s 
                    outrageous what you have allowed your guest to say tonight. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">SCARBOROUGH: Well, I certainly 
                    haven&rsquo;t allowed him to say anything. He&rsquo;s come on. 
                    It&rsquo;s a free country. And even though I disagree with 
                    him, he&rsquo;s free to say what he says, just like you. You&rsquo;re 
                    free to come on and say what you&rsquo;ve said. We certainly 
                    appreciate it. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">And certainly, this is not 
                    a question about whether Mexicans should be able to immigrate 
                    to America or whether Lithuanians should be able to immigrate 
                    to America. We are a country of immigrants. Americans are 
                    great. We are a great country because we are the melting pot. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">But, at the same time, those 
                    people that have come here before as immigrants have come 
                    here legally. That&rsquo;s the issue here. It&rsquo;s not about 
                    whether they&rsquo;re Mexicans or Canadians or whether they&rsquo;re 
                    from England or whether they&rsquo;re from Russia or whether 
                    they&rsquo;re from China. It&rsquo;s whether they stand in line 
                    with the other illegal immigrants. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">I constantly, when I was in 
                    Congress and even now, I have people that I run into that 
                    are from China or from Pakistan. I have a gentleman from Pakistan 
                    who said his wife is over in Pakistan and he wants to get 
                    her here with the rest of his family. But he can&rsquo;t do 
                    it, because the INS will not allow her in here. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">I think it&rsquo;s absurd that 
                    other people wait in lines and they live by the rules of our 
                    land, the immigration rules of our land. But one group of 
                    people, just because they live on our southern border, are 
                    able to come in here, break our laws, and have American politicians 
                    saying, that&rsquo;s OK. It has nothing to do with whether 
                    they&rsquo;re Mexicans or Pakistanis or Canadians. It&rsquo;s 
                    whether the people that come into this country do it legally. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Anyway, I want to thank both 
                    of our guests for joining us. </font></p>
