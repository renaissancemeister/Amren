<h1>Turning the Tide</h1>
<p>At the 2015 American Renaissance conference, Peter Brimelow predicted it might take &#8220;only one speech&#8221; to awaken the Historic American Nation to its demographic plight. At the 2016 conference, he made a new prediction: It might take &#8220;only one election.&#8221; Was Donald Trump&rsquo;s victory the turning point we&rsquo;ve been hoping for?</p>
<p>Join us for a weekend of candor, fellowship, and top-notch speakers, as we celebrate the shifting political tides and discuss the way forward for White America and the Western World.</p>
<p>Speakers will include:</p>
