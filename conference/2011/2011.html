        <h1> Ninth American Renaissance Conference (2011)</h1>
        <p class="lead"> Defending the West </p>
        <p class="byline"> Feb. 4&ndash;Feb. 6, 2011, Charlotte, North Carolina </p>
        <p>Ours is an era of fear and self-censorship. Virtually no whites are willing to break taboos about racial differences in IQ, the costs of &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; or the challenges of non-white immigration. We are different. We believe these are vital questions.</p>
        <p> At this conference you will hear some of the most courageous academics, journalists, and political figures of our time discuss the forces that will determine our future. This will be a remarkable group of speakers and guests &mdash; undeceived, outspoken, and committed to the defense of Western Civilization. </p>
        <p> Please join us for what is sure to be an extraordinary weekend. <a href="https://store.amren.com/cart.php?target=category&amp;category_id=97">Register today on-line</a>. </p>
        <p>Speakers will include:</p>
