        <p class="lead"> Defending the West </p>
        <p class="byline">March 16 &ndash; 18, 2012, near Nashville, Tennessee</p>
        <p>Ours is an era of fear and self-censorship. Virtually no whites are willing to break taboos about racial differences in IQ, the costs of &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; or the challenges of non-white immigration. We are different. We believe these are vital questions.</p>
        <p>At this conference you will hear some of the most courageous academics, authors, and journalists of our time discuss the forces that will determine our future. This will be a remarkable group of speakers and guests  &mdash;  undeceived, outspoken, and committed to the defense of Western Civilization. </p>
        <p>Speakers will include:</p>

        <h2>Register today for the 10th American Renaissance Conference</h2>
        <p class="lead">March 16 &ndash; 18, 2012, near Nashville, Tennessee</p>
        <h3>Conference Schedule:</h3>
        <p> The conference will begin on Friday, March 16, 2012, with registration from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. There will then be a reception followed by opening remarks from the American Renaissance staff. Latecomer registration is at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, March 17, and the program will begin promptly at 9:00 a.m.</p>
        <p> There will be a banquet (separate charge of $35) on Saturday evening. Participants with alternate dinner plans are welcome after the meal to hear the after-dinner speaker. The program will resume at 9:00 a.m. on Sunday the 18th, and end at noon.</p>
        <p> Gentlemen will wear jackets and ties to conference events. We will prepare name tags in advance; call us if you would like to use a nom de guerre.</p>
        <p> Please contact us if you or your organization would like to set up a vendor table.</p>
        <h3>Accommodations and Transportation:</h3>
        <p> The conference will be at a beautiful, government-owned facility that is about a 45 minute drive from Nashville, TN. We have no fear of cancellation, and will be announcing the exact location soon. If you fly, it would be best to rent a car at Nashville airport (they are less than $20 a day if you book early), but we may arrange for a shuttle bus if enough people are arriving and departing at the same time.</p>
        <p> It will help us greatly if you register early and it will also ensure you a room on site.</p>
        <h3>          Payment:</h3>
        <p> Registration for the conference is $100 per person, $150 after February 16, 2012. Accommodations are only $68 per night, and there is no extra charge for double occupancy. A room for two nights (Friday and Saturday), including all taxes, is $144. A total of $244 therefore reserves your place at the conference, as well as lodging for two nights. Just provide your name at check-in. </p>
        <p> We cannot guarantee rooms past February 16. You may cancel for a full refund, up to 72 hours before the conference begins.</p>
