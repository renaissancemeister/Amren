<p><em>April 5 – 7, 2013, near Nashville, Tennessee</em></p>
<p>The West faces many crises, but the greatest is the crisis of race. In virtually every Western country, the European majority is threatened with dispossession by non-white immigrants.</p>
<p>Unless whites rekindle their consciousness of race and act in their own interests, they will be pushed aside by others.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to a renewed sense of Western peoplehood. Join us for a stimulating weekend of education, fellowship &mdash; and recommitment to the ideals of Western Civilization.</p>
<p>Speakers will include:</p>

Latecomer registration is at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, April 6, and the program will begin promptly at 9:00 a.m.</p>
<p>There will be a banquet (separate charge of $35) on Saturday evening. Participants with alternate dinner plans are welcome after the meal to hear the after-dinner speaker. The program will resume on Sunday the 7th, and end at 10:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Gentlemen will wear jackets and ties to conference events. We will prepare name tags in advance; during registration, be sure to indicate if you would like to use a <em>nom de guerre</em>.</p>
<p>Please contact us if you or your organization would like to set up a vendor table.</p>
<h3>Accommodations and Transportation:</h3>
<p>The conference will be at a beautiful, government-owned facility that is about a 45 minute drive from Nashville, TN. It is Montgomery Bell State Park, and the address is 1000 Hotel Avenue, Burns, Tennessee. The telephone number is 615 797 3101. If you fly, it would be best to rent a car at Nashville airport (they are less than $20 a day if you book early).</p>

<p>There are a limited number of suites and villas available for those who wish to attend as groups.</p>
<p>Suites (1 king bed, 2 double beds): $205/night.  Villas (1 king, 2 queen, 1 queen sofa sleeper): $326/night.   Please call if you would like to reserve a suite or villa.</p>
<h3>Payment:</h3>
<p>Registration for the conference is $125. The optional banquet is an additional $35 per person.</p>
<p>Accommodations are only $82 per night, and there is no extra charge for double occupancy. A room for two nights (Friday and Saturday), including all taxes, is $164. A total of $264 therefore reserves your place at the conference, as well as lodging for two nights. Just provide your name at check-in.</p>
