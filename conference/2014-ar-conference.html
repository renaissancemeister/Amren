<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Prospects for Our People</span></strong></p>
<p>The last half century has seen steady dispossession of the European peoples. Our rulers have welcomed the mass immigration and &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; that are transforming every historically white nation.</p>
<p>We stand against dispossession. We assert our natural preference for the culture, heritage, and folkways of our people.</p>
<p>Nor are we frightened by taboos. We call on whites to rekindle a consciousness of race, for without it, neither we nor our civilization will survive.</p>
<p>We invite you to join us for a weekend of education, fellowship, and careful consideration of the Prospects for Our People.</p>
<p>Speakers will include:</p>
