<p>We are united in our commitment to Western Civilization and to the World Brotherhood of Europeans that holds our civilization in trust for future generations.</p>
<p>Join us for a weekend of top-notch speakers, candor, and fellowship that will sustain you long after you return to the world of lies and delusions.</p>
<p>Speakers will include:</p>

Latecomer registration is at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, April 18, and the program will begin promptly at 9:00 a.m.</p>
<p>There will be a <strong>banquet</strong> (separate charge of $35) on Saturday evening. Participants with alternate dinner plans are welcome after the meal to hear the after-dinner speaker. After the banquet, as a special event, all participants are invited by our <strong>French comrades</strong> for <strong>cocktails and refreshments</strong> at their villa.</p>
<p>The program will resume on <strong>Sunday</strong> the 19th and end at 10:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Gentlemen will wear <strong>jackets and ties</strong>-equivalent dress for ladies-to conference events. We will prepare name tags in advance; when you register with American Renaissance, you may indicate if you would like to use a <em>nom de guerre</em>.</p>
